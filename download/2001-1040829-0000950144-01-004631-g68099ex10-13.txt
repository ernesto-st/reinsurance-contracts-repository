SECTION 2.1 LOAN.

         (A) LOAN. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Loan Agreement
and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Borrower contained
herein, Lender agrees to purchase the Original Loan from Original Lender, make
the New Advance to Borrower, combine and consolidate the New Advance and the
Original Loan into a single indebtedness in the original principal amount of
$275,000,000 and amend and restate such loan in the original principal amount of
$275,000,000 upon the terms and conditions hereof (the Original Loan, as amended
and restated hereby, and the obligation of Borrower to repay the same together
with all interest and other amounts from time to time owing hereunder may be
referred to as the "LOAN").

         (B) NOTE. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall execute and deliver to
Lender an Amended and Restated Promissory Note, dated of even date herewith (as
amended, modified or restated, and any replacement or substitute notes therefor,
by means of multiple notes or otherwise, collectively, the "NOTE"), made by
Borrower to the order of Lender, in the original principal amount of
$275,000,000.

         (C) USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loan funded at Closing shall
be used to (i) acquire the Original Loan from Original Lender; (ii) pay all
recording fees and taxes, title insurance premiums, the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Lender, including the legal fees and expenses of counsel to
Lender, and other costs and expenses approved by Lender (which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld) related to the Loan; and (iii) establish the Reserves
required hereunder. The remaining proceeds of the Loan, if any, shall be
disbursed to Borrower.

SECTION 2.2 INTEREST.

         (A) RATE OF INTEREST. The outstanding principal balance of the Loan
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect for
each Interest Accrual Period during the term hereof. The "INTEREST Rate" for any
Interest Accrual Period shall be the rate of interest per annum equal to the sum
of (i) the Applicable Spread plus (ii) the LIBO Rate in effect for such Interest
Accrual Period.

         (B) DEFAULT RATE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default and in any event from and
after the Maturity Date of the Loan, the outstanding principal balance of the
Loan and all other Obligations shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate
per annum that is four percent (4.0%) in excess of the Interest Rate otherwise
applicable under this Loan Agreement and the Note (the "DEFAULT RATE").

         (C) COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Loan and all other
Obligations owing to Lender shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year,
and shall be charged for the actual number of days elapsed during any month or
other accrual period. Interest shall be payable in arrears (except with respect
to the number of days from the Payment Date in any Interest Accrual Period to

                                       21
<PAGE>   27

         (D) INTEREST LAWS. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall not
be required to pay, and Lender shall not be permitted to collect, any amount of
interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by law ("EXCESS
INTEREST"). If any Excess Interest is provided for or determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have been provided for in this Loan Agreement or in
any of the other Loan Documents, then in such event: (1) the provisions of this
subsection shall govern and control; (2) Borrower shall not be obligated to pay
any Excess Interest; (3) any Excess Interest that Lender may have received
hereunder shall be, at Lender's option, (a) applied as a credit against either
or both of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan or accrued and unpaid
interest thereunder (not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by law), (b)
refunded to the payor thereof, or (c) any combination of the foregoing; (4) the
interest rate(s) provided for herein shall be automatically reduced to the
maximum lawful rate allowed from time to time under applicable law (the "MAXIMUM
RATE"), and this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to
have been and shall be, reformed and modified to reflect such reduction; and (5)
Borrower shall not have any action against Lender for any damages arising out of
the payment or collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if for any period of time interest on any Obligation is calculated at the
Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this Loan Agreement, and
thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of
interest payable on such Obligations shall, to the extent permitted by law,
remain at the Maximum Rate until Lender shall have received or accrued the
amount of interest which Lender would have received or accrued during such
period on Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Maximum
Rate during such period. If the Default Rate shall be finally determined to be
unlawful, then the Interest Rate shall be applicable during any time when the
Default Rate would have been applicable hereunder, provided however that if the
Maximum Rate is greater or lesser than the Interest Rate, then the foregoing
provisions of this paragraph shall apply.

         (E) LATE CHARGES. If an Event of Default regarding non-payment of
principal, interest or other sums due hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents shall occur, then Borrower shall pay to Lender, in addition to all
sums otherwise due and payable, a late fee in an amount equal to five percent
(5.0%) of such principal, interest or other sums due hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, such late charge to be immediately due and payable without
demand by Lender.

         (F) ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. In addition to the Default Rate
provided for above, upon failure of any Borrower Party to deliver any of the
financial statements or reports required to be delivered to Lender as provided
in Sections 5.1(A)(i), (ii), (iii) or (v) hereof upon their due dates, if any
such failure shall continue for ten (10) Business Days following written notice
thereof from Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender together with the scheduled
monthly payments of principal and interest on the Note, for each month or
portion thereof that any such financial statement or report required under
Sections 5.1(A)(i), (ii), (iii) or (v) remains undelivered, an administrative
fee in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000). Borrower agrees that such
administrative fee (i) is a fair and reasonable fee necessary to compensate
Lender for its additional administrative costs under the circumstances, (ii) is
not a penalty and (iii) is necessary to compensate Lender for increased costs
and obligations to third parties in connection with the planned Securitization
of the Loan.

SECTION 2.3 INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT.

         (A) As a condition to Closing, Borrower shall purchase and pledge and
deliver to Lender an interest rate cap agreement satisfying the criteria set
forth below (the "CAP"), and Borrower shall maintain such Cap in the possession
of Lender, in full force and effect, until all Obligations are fully and finally
repaid. The Cap (i) shall have a notional amount equal to the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan calculated based upon the declining principal
balance of the Loan scheduled to be outstanding over the term of such Cap taking
into account scheduled principal amortization hereunder, (ii) shall provide that
to the extent that LIBO Rate exceeds seven and one-half percent (7.50%) per
annum (the "CAP THRESHOLD RATE"), then the Cap Provider shall pay to Lender not
less than the amount of interest that would accrue on the Loan at a per annum
rate equal to difference between LIBO Rate and the Cap Threshold Rate, (iii)
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender, (iv) shall
have a term equal to the Initial Term of the Loan (or the applicable Extension
Term), and (v) shall be issued by a financial institution (the "CAP PROVIDER")

rating from each of the other Rating Agencies) and otherwise be acceptable to
Lender in Lender's reasonable discretion at the time that the Cap is issued.

         (B) If at any time the financial rating assigned to any Cap Provider by
S&P shall fall below AA- (or the equivalent rating for any other Rating Agency)
and, if the Cap Provider's obligations under the Cap shall then be guaranteed
under a guaranty (the "CAP GUARANTY") issued by a financial institution (the
"CAP GUARANTOR"), then the financial rating assigned to such Cap Guarantor by
S&P shall have also fallen below AA- (or the equivalent rating for any other
Rating Agency), Borrower shall be required to deliver a replacement Cap in
substantially the form of the Cap delivered at Closing issued by a Cap Provider
meeting the rating requirements for a Cap Provider under Section 2.3(A)(v),
providing for a cap "strike price" not greater than eight and one-quarter
percent (8.25%) per annum and otherwise reasonably acceptable to Lender (a
replacement Cap meeting all of the foregoing conditions, an "ACCEPTABLE
REPLACEMENT CAP") within ten (10) Business Days after such downgrade of the Cap
Provider (and, if applicable, the Cap Guarantor), together with an assignment of
such Cap substantially in the form of the Assignment of Rate Cap and such
Financing Statements and opinions of counsel to the Cap Provider as Lender may
require each in form and substance acceptable to Lender. If, for any reason,
Borrower is unable to deliver a replacement Cap when required hereunder, then at
or prior to the time when the replacement Cap is due hereunder, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender cash security (such cash security together with any interest
thereon, the "CAP RESERVE") in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of
additional interest which Lender reasonably estimates may be incurred during the
remaining term of the Loan (or remaining Extension Term then in effect) as a
result of the LIBO Rate exceeding the Cap Threshold Rate, which Cap Reserve
shall be held by Lender and applied to the Obligations in accordance with
Section 6.1. Upon delivery of a replacement Cap acceptable to Lender, the
remaining balance of the Cap Reserve shall be returned to Borrower. In addition,
Borrower shall have the one time right at any time prior to the Scheduled
Maturity Date to deliver an Acceptable Replacement Cap to Lender provided that
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and provided that, in the
opinion of counsel to Lender, delivery of such Acceptable Replacement Cap would
not have an adverse effect on the qualification of any trust in connection with
a Securitization backed in whole or in part by the Loan as a REMIC (as defined
in the IRC) or any other adverse tax consequences to any investor in such
Securitization. Borrower shall be



                                       23
<PAGE>   29

required to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender
(and by any Servicer and trustee in connection with any Securitization backed in
whole or in part by the Loan) in connection with delivery of such Acceptable
Replacement Cap and all related documentation and opinions required above.

         (C) All payments made by the Cap Provider (and/or, if applicable, the
Cap Guarantor) under the Cap (or Cap Guaranty) shall be deposited directly by
the Cap Provider (and/or the Cap Guarantor) into the Central Account and applied
in accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.

SECTION 2.4 PAYMENTS.

         (A) PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. Borrower shall make a payment
to Lender of interest only on the Closing Date for the period from the Closing
Date through and including the day immediately prior to the first Business Day
of the calendar month following the month in which the Closing Date occurs.
Commencing on April 30, 2001 and continuing on each Payment Date thereafter
through but excluding the Maturity Date, Borrower shall make monthly payments
(each, a "MONTHLY DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT") of (i) principal in the amount of
$667,000 per month and (ii) interest in an amount equal to interest accrued on
the outstanding principal balance of the Loan at the Interest Rate in effect for
the related Interest Accrual Period. Each payment shall be applied first to
accrued and unpaid interest and the balance to principal.

         (B) DATE AND TIME OF PAYMENT. Borrower shall receive credit for
payments on the Loan which are transferred to the account of Lender as provided
below (i) on the day that such funds are received by Lender if such receipt
occurs by 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, or (ii) on the next succeeding
Business Day after such funds are received by Lender if such receipt occurs
after 1:00 p.m. (New York time). Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall
be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment may be made
on the next succeeding Business Day.

         (C) MANNER OF PAYMENT. Borrower promises to pay all of the Obligations
relating to the Loan as such amounts become due or are declared due pursuant to
the terms of this Loan Agreement. All payments by Borrower on the Loan shall be
made without deduction, defense, set off or counterclaim and in immediately
available funds delivered to Lender by wire transfer to such accounts at such
banks as Lender may from time to time designate.

SECTION 2.5 MATURITY.

         (A) SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. To the extent not sooner due and payable
in accordance with the Loan Documents (and unless Borrower shall extend the term
of the Loan for the First Extension Term or both of the Extension Terms upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of Section 2.5(B) below), the then
outstanding principal balance of the Loan, all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (and including interest through the end of the Interest Accrual Period
then in effect), and all other sums then owing to Lender hereunder and under the
Note, the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, shall be due and payable
on the Scheduled Maturity Date.



                                       24
<PAGE>   30

         (B) EXTENSION TERMS. Borrower may extend the term of the Loan for two
extension terms of one year each (each, an "EXTENSION TERM", and, collectively
the "EXTENSION TERMS"); (i) the first Extension Term (the "FIRST EXTENSION
TERM") commencing on the day immediately following the Scheduled Maturity Date
and ending (unless sooner terminated in accordance with the Loan Documents) the
first (1st) anniversary of the Scheduled Maturity Date and (ii) the second
Extension Term (the "SECOND EXTENSION TERM") commencing on the day immediately
following the last day of the First Extension Term and ending (unless sooner
terminated in accordance with the Loan Documents) on the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Scheduled Maturity Date; subject to the following terms and
conditions:

              (i)      Borrower shall give Lender notice (an "EXTENSION NOTICE")
                       of its request to extend the term of the Loan for either
                       Extension Period at least thirty (30) but not more than
                       one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the Scheduled
                       Maturity Date or expiration of the First Extension Term,
                       as the case may be;

              (ii)     no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                       continuing as of the date Borrower delivers an Extension
                       Notice or as of the Scheduled Maturity Date or expiration
                       of the First Extension Term, as the case may be;

              (iii)    the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (with debt service on the
                       Loan recalculated assuming that interest would have been
                       payable at an interest rate equal to the sum of the
                       Extension Cap Threshold Rate plus the Applicable Spread,
                       in each case, in effect for the first month of the
                       Extension Term in question and including required
                       principal amortization payments under Section 2.4(A)) for
                       the twelve (12) month period ended ninety (90) days prior
                       to the Scheduled Maturity Date or expiration of the First
                       Extension Term, as the case may be, is at least 1.49:1.0;
                       and

              (iv)     Borrower shall deliver to Lender an extension of the Cap
                       or a replacement Cap (and an extension or replacement of
                       the Cap Guaranty, if applicable) in form substantially
                       the same as the Cap (and Cap Guaranty) delivered at
                       Closing covering the term of the applicable Extension
                       Term, providing for a cap "strike price" (such "strike
                       price", the "EXTENSION CAP THRESHOLD RATE") not greater
                       than eight and one-quarter percent (8.25%) per annum (it
                       being acknowledged that Borrower may purchase an
                       extension or replacement Cap for the applicable Extension
                       Term with an Extension Cap Threshold Rate lower than such
                       rate in order to satisfy the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
                       requirement under Section 2.5(B)(iii) above) and
                       otherwise satisfying the requirements of Section 2.3
                       together with an assignment of such replacement Cap
                       substantially in the form of the Assignment of Rate Cap
                       and such Financing Statements and opinions of counsel to
                       the Cap Provider (and Cap Guarantor, if applicable) as
                       Lender may require each in form and substance acceptable
                       to Lender. Borrower shall be required to pay any and all
                       reasonable costs and expenses (including, without
                       limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and



                                       25
<PAGE>   31

                       disbursements) incurred by Lender (and by any Servicer
                       and trustee in connection with any Securitization backed
                       in whole or in part by the Loan) in connection with
                       delivery of such extension or replacement Cap (and
                       extension or replacement of the Cap Guaranty, if
                       applicable) and all related documentation and opinions
                       required above.

SECTION 2.6 PREPAYMENT.

         (A) LIMITATION ON PREPAYMENT; PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION DUE ON
ACCELERATION. Borrower shall have no right to prepay the Loan in whole or part
prior to April 30, 2002, except as expressly set forth in this provision. On and
after April 30, 2002, Borrower may prepay the Loan in whole, but not in part,
without payment of Prepayment Consideration, provided that (i) Borrower shall
provide to Lender not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such
prepayment, (ii) together with such prepayment Borrower also shall pay all
accrued and unpaid interest and all other Obligations and (iii) if such
prepayment occurs on any day other than a Payment Date, then together therewith
Borrower also shall pay to Lender the amount of interest that would have accrued
on the amount being prepaid from and including the date of such prepayment to
the end of such Interest Accrual Period.

         (B) PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION DUE. If any prepayment of all or any
portion of the Loan shall occur prior to April 30, 2002, on account of
acceleration of the Loan due to an Event of Default, or otherwise, then except
only as expressly provided herein to the contrary, Borrower shall pay the
Prepayment Consideration to Lender together with such prepayment, as liquidated
damages and compensation for costs incurred, and in addition to all other
amounts due and owing to Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Prepayment
Consideration will be due as to a prepayment of insurance or condemnation
proceeds required by Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the Deed of Trust
in the absence of an Event of Default or in connection with any partial
prepayment resulting from (i) the application of Excess Cash Flow from the Cash
Trap Reserve under Section 2.6(D) below or (ii) the application of any amounts
to principal under Section 3.3(a)(iii) of the Cash Management Agreement. The
foregoing designation of any amount of Prepayment Consideration in this
Agreement shall not create a right to prepay at any time or in any circumstances
where this Agreement does not expressly state that such a right exists.

         (C) DEFINITIONS. The following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

             "PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION" shall mean an amount equal to two
percent (2%) of the Loan balance at the time of prepayment.

         (D) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS; CASH TRAP EVENTS. (i) If, at any time prior
to the repayment of the Obligations in full, a Cash Trap Event shall occur,
then, from and after the occurrence of such Cash Trap Event and for so long as
such Cash Trap Event continues to exist, pursuant to the Cash Management
Agreement all Excess Cash Flow (except as otherwise expressly provided below)
shall be deposited with Lender (or its Servicer or agent) (said funds, together
with any interest thereon, the "CASH TRAP RESERVE"). A "CASH TRAP EVENT" shall
occur as of any Calculation Date when the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for a
trailing twelve (12) month period (determined upon delivery of the financial
statements for such Calculation Date



                                       26
<PAGE>   32

and with debt service on the Loan calculated at an amount equal to the lesser of
(a) the actual debt service paid during such period and (b) the debt service
amount which would have been payable during such period if interest were
recalculated at an interest rate equal to the sum of the Cap Threshold Rate (or
applicable Extension Cap Threshold Rate, as the case may be) plus the then
Applicable Spread, and, in either case, including required principal
amortization payments under Section 2.4(A)) is less than the Minimum DSCR and
shall continue to exist until such Minimum DSCR test has been satisfied for
three (3) consecutive calendar months (on a trailing twelve (12) month basis and
determined upon delivery of the financial statements for each such month);
provided that for purposes of determining the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for
the Calculation Dates occurring on June 30, 2001, September 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2001 (and for any Monthly Test Date occurring prior to March 31,
2002), debt service under clause (a) above shall be equal to the product of (1)
the actual debt service for the three (3) month period ended as of such
Calculation Date (or as of such Monthly Test Date) multiplied by (2) four.
Notwithstanding that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall be less than the
Minimum DSCR as of any Calculation Date, no Cash Trap Event shall be deemed to
exist hereunder provided that Borrower makes a principal prepayment on the Loan
(which prepayment amount shall be held in the Debt Service Sub-Account and
applied to payment of principal on the next Payment Date without any Prepayment
Consideration), within two (2) Business Days after the date of delivery of the
financial statements disclosing the existence of such Cash Trap Event (or the
date on which such financial statements are required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 5.1), in an amount which as determined by Lender, in its sole good faith
discretion, would be sufficient to cause the Debt Service Coverage Ratio to
exceed the Minimum DSCR if interest payable on the Loan included in determining
such Debt Service Coverage Ratio were recalculated as provided above assuming
that such amount were applied to reduce the principal amount of the Loan as of
the first day of the relevant measuring period. "MINIMUM DSCR" means 1.25:1.0.
"CALCULATION DATE" means the last day of each calendar quarter commencing with
the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2001. Following the Calculation Date on
which a Cash Trap Event occurs, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (with debt
service calculated as provided above) shall exceed the Minimum DSCR as of the
end of any calendar month (each, a "MONTHLY TEST DATE") (calculated on a
trailing twelve (12) month basis and determined upon delivery of the financial
statements for such Monthly Test Date), the Excess Cash Flow available for the
month following delivery of the financial statements for such Monthly Test Date
shall be released to Borrower in accordance with the provisions of the Cash
Management Agreement. During the continuance of a Cash Trap Event, any funds on
deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve may be applied to payment of principal (without
payment of any Prepayment Consideration) or other Obligations in such order as
Lender may elect upon the third (3rd) Payment Date following deposit of such
funds. Any funds on deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve shall continue to be held
as additional Collateral in accordance with this Section 2.6(D)(i) until the
earlier of (a) the date that such funds are applied to payment of the
Obligations pursuant to the foregoing sentence and (b) the date that Lender has
determined that the Minimum DSCR test has been satisfied for three (3)
consecutive Monthly Test Dates, at which time such funds shall be released to
Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Cash Trap Event shall occur three
(3) times during the term hereof, from and after the third (3rd) such occurrence
of a Cash Trap Event, Borrower shall have no further right to cure a Cash Trap
Event (by satisfying the Minimum DSCR test or by making principal prepayments as
provided above), and until such time as the Loan is paid in full all Excess Cash
Flow shall be deposited in the Cash Trap Reserve and all funds in the Cash Trap
Reserve shall be applied by



                                       27
<PAGE>   33

Lender on the next Payment Date to reduce the principal amount of the Loan
(without payment of any Prepayment Consideration) or to payment of the other
Obligations in such order as Lender may elect. The existence of a Cash Trap
Event shall be determined by Lender in its sole good faith determination. If
Lender determines that a Cash Trap Event has occurred, Lender shall send
Borrower written notice thereof. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all funds on
deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve and any subsequent Excess Cash Flow, while such
Event of Default is continuing, may be applied by Lender to payment of principal
(including payment of any Prepayment Consideration) or other Obligations in such
order as Lender may elect.

         (ii) In addition to principal prepayments required under Section
2.6(D)(i), Borrower shall be required to make prepayments of principal equal to
any amount required to be remitted to Lender by the Mezzanine Lender from cash
trap reserves maintained under the Mezzanine Loan Documents pursuant to Section
6 of the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the date hereof.

SECTION 2.7 OUTSTANDING BALANCE. The balance on Lender's books and records shall
be presumptive evidence (absent manifest error) of the amounts owing to Lender
by Borrower; provided that any failure to record any transaction affecting such
balance or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect
Borrower's obligation to pay the Obligations.

SECTION 2.8 TAXES. Any and all payments or reimbursements made hereunder or
under the Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and
all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (all such taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect
thereto [excluding taxes imposed on net income in accordance with the following
sentence] herein "TAX LIABILITIES"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower
shall not be liable for taxes imposed on the net income of Lender by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is organized or doing business or
any political subdivision thereof and taxes imposed on its net income by the
jurisdiction of Lender's applicable lending office or any political subdivision
thereof. If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any such Tax Liabilities
(or amounts in estimation or reimbursement for the same) from or in respect of
any sum payable hereunder to Lender, then the sum payable hereunder shall be
increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions,
Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made.

SECTION 2.9 REASONABLENESS OF CHARGES. Borrower Parties agree that (i) the
actual costs and damages that Lender would suffer by reason of a Default
(exclusive of the attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in connection with
enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents) or a prepayment would
be difficult and needlessly expensive to calculate and establish, and (ii) the
amounts of the Default Rate, the late charges, and the Prepayment Consideration
are reasonable, taking into consideration the circumstances known to the parties
at this time, and (iii) such Default Rate and late charges and Lender's
attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents shall be due and payable
as provided herein, and (iv) such Default Interest, late



                                       28
<PAGE>   34

charges, Prepayment Consideration, and the obligation to pay Lender's attorneys'
fees and other enforcement costs do not, individually or collectively,
constitute a penalty.

SECTION 2.10 FUNDING LOSSES/CHANGE IN LAW ETC.

         (A) Borrower hereby agrees to pay to Lender any amount necessary to
compensate Lender and any Funding Party for any losses or costs (including,
without limitation, the costs of breaking any "LIBOR" contract, if applicable,
or funding losses determined on the basis of Lender's or such Funding Party's
reinvestment rate and the interest rate on the Loan) (collectively, "FUNDING
LOSSES") sustained by Lender or any Funding Party: (i) if the Note, or any
portion thereof, is repaid for any reason whatsoever on any date other than a
Payment Date (including, without limitation, from condemnation or insurance
proceeds); or (ii) as a consequence of (x) any increased cost of funds that
Lender or any Funding Party may sustain in maintaining the borrowing evidenced
hereby or (y) the reduction of any amounts received or receivable from Borrower,
in either case, due to the introduction of, or any change in, law or applicable
regulation or treaty adopted after the date hereof (including the administration
or interpretation thereof), whether or not having the force of law, or due to
the compliance by Lender or the Funding Party, as the case may be, with any
directive, whether or not having the force of law, or request from any central
bank or domestic or foreign governmental authority, agency or instrumentality
having jurisdiction made as of the date hereof.

         (B) If Lender or any Funding Party shall have determined that the
applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted pursuant to or
arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the adoption of any other law,
rule, regulation or guideline (including but not limited to any United States
law, rule, regulation or guideline) regarding capital adequacy, or any change
becoming effective in any of the foregoing or in the enforcement or
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any court or any
domestic or foreign governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency
charged with the enforcement or interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by Lender or its holding company or a Funding Party or its holding
company, as the case may be, with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency made after the date hereof, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of Lender or its holding
company, or of the Funding Party's or its holding company, as the case may be,
then, upon demand by Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender, from time to time,
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender or such Funding
Party for any such reduction suffered.

         (C) Any amount payable by Borrower under Section 2.10(A) or 2.10(B)
shall be paid to Lender within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by Borrower
of a certificate signed by an officer of Lender setting forth the amount due and
the basis for the determination of such amount in reasonable detail and the
computations made by Lender to determine the amount due, which statement shall
be conclusive and binding upon Borrower, absent manifest error. Failure on the
part of Lender to demand payment from Borrower for any such amount attributable
to any particular period shall not constitute a waiver of Lender's right to
demand payment of such amount for any subsequent or prior period. Lender shall
use reasonable efforts to deliver to Borrower prompt notice (and adequate
information to permit Borrower to verify the basis for and



                                       29
<PAGE>   35

calculation of amounts due) of any event described in Sections 2.10(A) or
2.10(B) above and of the amount to be paid as a result thereof, provided,
however, any failure by Lender to so notify Borrower shall not affect Borrower's
obligation to make the payments to be made under this Section as a result
thereof. All amounts which may become due and payable by Borrower in accordance
with the provisions of this Section shall constitute additional interest under
the Loan and shall be secured by the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents.

         (D) If Lender or any Funding Party requests compensation for any losses
or costs to be reimbursed pursuant to any one or more of the provisions of
clause (ii) of Sections 2.10(A) or 2.10(B), then, upon request of Borrower,
Lender or such Funding Party shall use reasonable efforts in a manner consistent
with such institution's practice in connection with loans like the Loan to
eliminate, mitigate or reduce amounts that would otherwise be payable by
Borrower under the foregoing provisions, provided that such action would not be
otherwise prejudicial to Lender or such Funding Party, including, without
limitation, by designating another of Lender's or such Funding Party's offices,
branches or affiliates; Borrower hereby agreeing to pay all reasonably incurred
costs and expenses incurred by Lender or any Funding Party in connection with
any such action.

                                  ARTICLE III
                               CONDITIONS TO LOAN

SECTION 3.1 CONDITIONS TO FUNDING OF THE LOAN ON THE CLOSING DATE. The
obligations of Lender to fund the Loan are subject to the prior or concurrent
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth below, and to satisfaction of
any other conditions specified herein or elsewhere in the Loan Documents. Where
in this Section any documents, instruments or information are to be delivered to
Lender, then the condition shall not be satisfied unless (i) the same shall be
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, and (ii) if so required by Lender,
Borrower shall deliver to Lender a certificate duly executed by Borrower stating
that the applicable document, instrument or information is true and complete and
does not omit to state any information without which the same might reasonably
be deemed materially misleading.

         (A) LOAN DOCUMENTS. On or before the Closing Date, Borrower shall
execute and deliver and cause to be executed and delivered to Lender all of the
Loan Documents specified in SCHEDULE 3.1(A), together with such other Loan
Documents as may be reasonably required by Lender, each, unless otherwise noted,
of even date herewith, duly executed, in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender and in quantities designated by Lender (except for the Note, of which
only one shall be signed), which Loan Documents shall become effective upon the
Closing.

         (B) ORIGINATION FEE. At the Closing and retained from the proceeds of
the Loan, Lender shall have received its origination fee of $2,750,000 (1.0% of
the Loan amount). The amount, if any, by which any application fee and/or
expense deposit previously paid to Lender on Borrower's behalf exceeds Lender's
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Loan, shall be
credited against the origination fee.

         (C) STRUCTURING FEE. At the Closing and retained from the proceeds of
the Loan, Lender shall have received its structuring fee of $3,437,500 (1.25% of

Permitted Encumbrances. Borrower owns and will own at all times all FF&E
relating to the Property (other than personal property which is both owned by
tenants of the Property and not used or necessary for the operation of the
Property), subject only to Permitted Encumbrances. The Deed of Trust, when

Commercial Code financing statements required to be filed in connection
therewith, will create (i) a valid, perfected first lien on the Property,
subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances, and (ii) perfected first priority
security interests in and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all

affecting the Property, and to the knowledge of Borrower Parties, none is
threatened. No Person has any option or other right to purchase all or any
portion of the Property or any interest therein. There are no mechanic's,
materialman's or other similar liens or claims which have been filed for work,
labor or materials affecting the Property which are or may be liens prior to, or
equal or coordinate with, the lien of the Deed of Trust. None of the Permitted
Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the
benefits of the security intended to be provided by the Deed of Trust and this
Loan Agreement, materially and adversely affect the value of the Property,
impair the use or operations of the Property or impair Borrower's ability to pay
its obligations in a timely manner.

SECTION 4.6 ZONING; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Property is zoned for commercial
use, which zoning designation is unconditional, in full force and effect, and is
beyond all applicable appeal periods. Borrower, the Property and the use thereof
comply in all material respects with all applicable zoning, subdivision and land
use laws, regulations and ordinances, all applicable health, fire, building
codes, parking laws and all other laws, statutes, codes, ordinances, rules and
regulations applicable to the Property, including without limitation the

activities relating to controlled substances on the Property. All material
permits, licenses and certificates for the lawful use, occupancy and operation
of each component of the Property in the manner in which it is currently being
used, occupied and operated, including, but not limited to liquor licenses and
certificates of occupancy, or the equivalent, have been obtained and are current
and in full force and effect. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower
represents that it is in the process of applying with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities for the transfer of liquor licenses and beer permits
for the Property from Guarantor's name to Borrower's name. Borrower covenants
and agrees that it shall file any applications and information required under
applicable law with the appropriate Governmental Authorities promptly after the
date hereof, diligently prosecute the processing of such applications and
complete the transfers of all such licenses and permits as soon as reasonably
practicable but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the
date hereof. In the event that all or any part of the Improvements located on
the Property are destroyed or damaged, said Improvements can be legally
reconstructed to their condition prior to such damage or destruction, and
thereafter exist for the same use without violating any zoning or other
ordinances applicable thereto and without the necessity of obtaining any
variances or



                                       37
<PAGE>   43

special permits, other than customary demolition, building and other
construction related permits. No legal proceedings are pending or, to the
knowledge of Borrower, threatened with respect to the zoning of the Property.
Neither the zoning nor any other right to construct, use or operate the Property
is in any way dependent upon or related to any real estate other than the
Property. No tract map, parcel map, condominium plan, condominium declaration,
or plat of subdivision will be recorded by Borrower with respect to the Property
without Lender's prior written consent.

threatened) against Borrower by any tenant or former tenant. No rental in excess
of one month's rent has been prepaid under any of the Leases. Each of the Leases
is valid and binding on the parties thereto in accordance with its terms.

Property. To Borrower's knowledge, no person occupies any part of the Property
for dwelling purposes.

been modified

<PAGE>   44

or amended except pursuant to amendments or modifications delivered to Lender.
The Management Agreement is in full force and effect and no default by Borrower
or Manager exists thereunder. Except for the parties to any leasing brokerage
agreement that has been delivered to Lender, no Person has any right or
obligation to lease or solicit tenants for the Property, or (except for

leasing.

         (E) FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. As of the date hereof, the Property is
operated as an independent hotel and is not the subject of a Franchise Agreement
with any franchisor. Borrower has the right to operate the Property under the

SECTION 4.8 CONDITION OF PROPERTY. To Borrower's knowledge, except as set forth
in the property condition report for the Property delivered to Lender, all
Improvements including, without limitation, the roof and all structural
components, plumbing systems, HVAC systems, fire protection systems, electrical
systems, equipment, elevators, exterior doors, parking facilities, sidewalks and
landscaping are in good condition and repair. Borrower is not aware of any
latent or patent structural or other material defect or deficiency in the
Property. City water supply, storm and sanitary sewers, and electrical, gas and
telephone facilities are available to the Property within the boundary lines of
the Property, are fully connected to the Improvements and are fully operational,
are sufficient to meet the reasonable needs of the Property as now used or
presently contemplated to be used, and no other utility facilities are necessary
to meet the reasonable needs of the Property as now used or presently
contemplated. The design and as-built conditions of the Property are such that
surface and storm water does not accumulate on the Property (except in
facilities specifically designed for the same) and does not drain from the
Property across land of adjacent property owners in any manner which would have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Property or violate any applicable law. Except
as may be shown on the Survey, no part of the Property is within a flood plain
and none of the Improvements create encroachment over, across or upon the
Property's boundary lines, rights of way or easements, and no building or other
improvements on adjoining land create such an encroachment which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All public roads and
streets necessary for service of and access to the Property for the current and
contemplated uses thereof have been completed and are serviceable and are
physically and legally open for use by the public. Any liquid or solid waste
disposal, septic or sewer system located at the Property is in good and safe
condition and repair and in compliance with all applicable law.

SECTION 4.9 LITIGATION; ADVERSE FACTS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9,
there are no judgments outstanding against any Borrower Party, Member or
affecting the Property or any property of any Borrower Party or Member, nor is
there any action, charge, claim, demand, suit, proceeding, petition,
governmental investigation or arbitration now pending or, to the knowledge of
Borrower after due inquiry, threatened against any Borrower Party or Member (and
which in the case of Guarantor, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect) affecting the Property. The actions, charges, claims,
demand, suits, proceedings, petitions, investigations and arbitrations set forth
on SCHEDULE 4.9 will not result, if adversely determined, and could not
reasonably be expected to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in
any Material Adverse Effect and do not relate to and will not affect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

payments in lieu of taxes) upon such Person and upon its properties, assets,
income and franchises which are due and payable have been paid when due and
payable. There is not presently pending (and to Borrower's knowledge, there is
not contemplated) any special assessment against the Property or any part
thereof. No tax liens are in existence and to the knowledge of Borrower Parties,
no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges,
accruals and reserves on the books of Borrower Parties in respect of any taxes
or other governmental charges are in accordance with GAAP.

SECTION 4.11 ADVERSE CONTRACTS. Except for the Loan Documents, none of the
Borrower Parties is a party to or bound by, nor is any property of such Person
subject to or bound by, any contract or other agreement which restricts such
Person's ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course or, either
individually or in the aggregate, has a Material Adverse Effect or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.12 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS. No Borrower Party is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation of any such Person which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default.

SECTION 4.13 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. No Borrower Party is subject to regulation
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or
the Investment Company Act of 1940 or to any federal or state statute or
regulation limiting its ability to incur indebtedness for borrowed money.

SECTION 4.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. No Primary Borrower Party maintains or
contributes to, or has any obligation (including a contingent obligation) under,
any Employee Benefit Plans except for the obligations to contribute to the
Employee Benefit Plans described on Schedule 4.14.

SECTION 4.15 BROKER'S FEES. No broker's or finder's fee, commission or similar
compensation will be payable by or pursuant to any contract or other obligation
of any Borrower Party with respect to the making of the Loan or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the Loan Documents.

SECTION 4.16 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.

         (A) NO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. There are no claims, liabilities,
investigations, litigation, administrative proceedings, whether pending or to
the knowledge of Borrower, threatened, or judgments or orders relating to any
Hazardous Materials (collectively, "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS") asserted or
threatened against Borrower or relating to the Property. Except as disclosed in
the Environmental Report delivered to Lender prior to Closing, neither Borrower
nor, to the knowledge of Borrower, any other Person has caused or permitted any
Hazardous Material to be used, generated, reclaimed, transported, released,
treated, stored or



                                       40
<PAGE>   46

disposed of in a manner which could form the basis for an Environmental Claim
against Borrower or relating to the Property.

         (B) STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Except as disclosed in the
Environmental Report delivered to Lender prior to Closing, except for materials
customarily used or stored in connection with operation and management of
properties similar to the Property, which materials at the Property exist only
in reasonable quantities and are stored, contained, transported, used, released,
and disposed of reasonably and without violation of any Environmental Laws, to
the knowledge of Borrower after due inquiry, no Hazardous Materials are or were
stored or otherwise located, and no underground storage tanks or surface
impoundments are or were located, on the Property, or to the knowledge of
Borrower, on adjacent parcels of real property, and no part of such real
property, or to the knowledge of Borrower after due inquiry, no part of such
adjacent parcels of real property, including the groundwater located therein or
thereunder, is presently contaminated by Hazardous Materials. Except as
disclosed in the Environmental Report, to Borrower's knowledge, the Property is
not listed by any Governmental Authority as containing any Hazardous Materials.

         (C) COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Borrower has been and is
currently in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, including
obtaining and maintaining in effect all permits, licenses or other
authorizations required by applicable Environmental Laws.

SECTION 4.17 SOLVENCY. Borrower (a) has not entered into the transaction or any
Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor
and (b) received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations
under the Loan Documents. Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of
Borrower's assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of the
Loan, exceed Borrower's total liabilities, including, without limitation,
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and Contingent Obligations. The fair
saleable value of Borrower's assets is and will, immediately following the
making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's probable liabilities, including
the maximum amount of its Contingent Obligations on its debts as such debts
become absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not and, immediately following
the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry
out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not
intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur Indebtedness and liabilities
(including Contingent Obligations and other commitments) beyond its ability to
pay such Indebtedness and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the
timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be
payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower).

SECTION 4.18 DISCLOSURE. No financial statements, Loan Document or any other
document, certificate or written statement furnished to Lender by or on behalf
of any Borrower Party or Member for use in connection with the Loan contains any
untrue representation, warranty or statement of a material fact, and none omits
or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained herein or therein not misleading. The foregoing representation is
qualified to the extent of the Borrower's knowledge, except for materials
prepared or executed by or pertaining directly to any Borrower Party. There is
no material fact known to Borrower that has had or will have a Material Adverse
Effect and that has not been disclosed in writing to Lender by Borrower.

SECTION 4.19 USE OF PROCEEDS AND MARGIN SECURITY. Borrower shall use the
proceeds of the Loan only for the purposes set forth herein and consistent with
all applicable laws, statutes, rules and regulations. No portion of the proceeds
of the Loan shall be used by Borrower or any Person in any manner that might
cause the borrowing or the application of such proceeds to violate Regulation T,
Regulation U or Regulation X or any other regulation of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.

SECTION 4.20 INSURANCE. Set forth on SCHEDULE 4.20 is a complete and accurate
description of all policies of insurance for Borrower that are in effect as of
the Closing Date. Borrower's insurance under such policies satisfies the
requirements contained in Section 5.4 hereof, no notice of cancellation has been

receivable from that other Person.

SECTION 4.23 BANKRUPTCY. Neither any Borrower Party nor Member is or has been a
debtor, and no property of any of them (including the Property) is property of
the estate, in any voluntary or involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or
under any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect. Neither any Borrower Party nor Member and no property of
any of them is under the possession or control of a receiver, trustee or other
custodian. Neither any Borrower Party nor Member has made any assignment for the
benefit of creditors. No such assignment or bankruptcy or similar case or
proceeding is now contemplated.

SECTION 4.24 DEFAULTS. No Default or Event of Default exists.

SECTION 4.25 NO PLAN ASSETS. Borrower is not and will not be (i) an employee
benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA which is subject to ERISA, (ii)
a plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the IRC which is subject to Section
4975 of the IRC, or (iii) an entity whose underlying assets constitute "plan
assets" of any such employee benefit plan or plan for purposes of Title I of
ERISA of Section 4975 of the IRC.

         Each Borrower Party covenants and agrees that until payment in full of

shall perform and comply with all covenants in this Article V applicable to such
Person.

and disbursement of all funds in the Capital Improvement Reserve, Borrower shall
be required to thereafter deliver Capital Improvements Plans to Lender for
informational purposes only, but same shall not be subject to Lender's approval;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect Borrower's obligation to

applicable budget or plan for the previous year shall remain in effect until the
new budget or plan is approved. Lender shall approve or disapprove any proposed
budget or plan requiring Lender's approval within fifteen (15) Business Days
after submission thereof by Borrower to Lender together with any information
reasonably requested by Lender in writing in order to review same. Lender's
consent to any proposed budget or plan shall be deemed given if the
correspondence from Borrower to Lender requesting such approval contains a
bold-faced conspicuous legend at the top of the first page thereof stating that
"IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR TO EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN
WRITING WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) BUSINESS DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL SHALL BE DEEMED GIVEN,"



                                       45
<PAGE>   51

and if Lender shall fail to respond to or expressly deny such request for
approval in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of
Borrower's written request therefor together with any information reasonably
requested by Lender in writing prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15)
Business Day period in order to adequately review same, then Lender shall be
deemed to have approved such budget or plan.

copies of all notices given or received with respect to noncompliance with any
term or condition related to any Permitted Indebtedness of any Borrower Party or
Member, including Permitted Indebtedness under the Mezzanine Loan Documents (but
excluding unsecured trade payables and equipment and personal property
financings referred to in Sections 5.17(B)(i) and (ii), respectively, unless
such non-compliance could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect), and shall notify Lender within two
(2) Business Days of any potential or actual event of default with respect to
any such Permitted Indebtedness.

             (ii) Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender copies of any and
all material notices (including without limitation any notice alleging any
default or breach) received with respect to any Material Agreement or any
Material Lease.

         (F) EVENTS OF DEFAULT, ETC. Promptly upon Borrower obtaining knowledge
of any of the following events or conditions, Borrower shall deliver a
certificate executed on its behalf by its chief financial officer or similar
officer specifying the nature and period of existence of such condition or event
and what action Borrower or any Affiliate thereof has taken, is taking and
proposes to take with respect thereto: (i) any condition or event that
constitutes an Event of Default or Default; (ii) any Material Adverse Effect; or
(iii) any actual or alleged breach or default or assertion of (or written threat
to assert) remedies under any Management Agreement.

         (G) LITIGATION. Promptly upon Borrower's obtaining knowledge of (1) the
institution of any action, suit, proceeding, governmental investigation or
arbitration against Borrower or the Property not previously disclosed in writing
by Borrower to Lender which would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (2) any material development in any action, suit, proceeding,
governmental investigation or arbitration at any time pending against or
affecting Borrower or the Property which, in each case, if adversely determined
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, Borrower will
give notice thereof to Lender and provide such other information as may be
reasonably available to them to enable Lender and its counsel to evaluate such
matter.

         (H) INSURANCE. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the end of each
insurance policy period of Borrower, Borrower will deliver certificates,
reports, and/or other information (all in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender), (i) outlining all material insurance coverage maintained as of the date

by Borrower in the subsequent insurance policy period and (ii) evidencing
payment in full of the premiums for such insurance policies.



                                       46
<PAGE>   52

         (I) OTHER INFORMATION. With reasonable promptness, Borrower will
deliver such other information and data with respect to such Person and its
Affiliates or the Property as from time to time may be reasonably requested by
Lender.

SECTION 5.2 EXISTENCE; QUALIFICATION. Borrower will at all times preserve and
keep in full force and effect its existence as a limited partnership, limited
liability company, or corporation, as the case may be, and all rights and
franchises material to its business, including its qualification to do business
in each state where it is required by law to so qualify. Without limitation of
the foregoing, Borrower and, to the extent required by applicable law, Member
shall at all times be qualified to business in the state where the Property is
located.

SECTION 5.3 PAYMENT OF IMPOSITIONS AND CLAIMS.

         (A) Borrower will pay (i) all Impositions; (ii) all claims (including
claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) for sums that have become
due and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any of its
properties or assets (hereinafter referred to as the "CLAIMS"); and (iii) all
federal, state and local income taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes and all other
taxes and assessments of Borrower on its business, income or assets; in each
instance before any penalty or fine is incurred with respect thereto.

         (B) Borrower shall not be required to pay, discharge or remove any
Imposition or Claim so long as Borrower contests in good faith such Imposition
or Claim or the validity, applicability or amount thereof by an appropriate
legal proceeding which operates to prevent the collection of such amounts and
the sale of the Property or any portion thereof, so long as: (i) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) prior to the date on which
such Imposition or Claim would otherwise have become delinquent, Borrower shall
have given Lender prior written notice of its intent to contest said Imposition
or Claim; (iii) prior to the date on which such Imposition or Claim would
otherwise have become delinquent, Borrower shall have deposited with Lender (or
with a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate body approved by
Lender) such additional amounts (or other security or assurances reasonably
acceptable to Lender) as are necessary to keep on deposit at all times, an
amount equal to at least one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) (or such higher
amount as may be required by applicable law) of the total of (x) the balance of
such Imposition or Claim then remaining unpaid, and (y) all interest, penalties,
costs and charges accrued or accumulated thereon less (z) amounts on deposit in
the Impositions and Insurance Reserve and available for payment of such Claims;
(iv) no risk of sale, forfeiture or loss of any interest in the Property or any
part thereof arises, in Lender's reasonable judgment, during the pendency of
such contest; (v) such contest does not, in Lender's reasonable determination,
have a Material Adverse Effect; and (vi) such contest is based on bona fide,
material, and reasonable claims or defenses. Any such contest shall be
prosecuted with due diligence, and Borrower shall promptly pay the amount of
such Imposition or Claim as finally determined, together with all interest and
penalties payable in connection therewith. Lender shall have full power and
authority, but no obligation, to apply any amount deposited with Lender under
this subsection to the payment of any unpaid Imposition or Claim to prevent the
sale or forfeiture of the Property for non-payment thereof, if Lender reasonably
believes that such sale or forfeiture is threatened. Any surplus retained by
Lender after payment of the Imposition or Claim for which a deposit was made
shall be promptly repaid to Borrower unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred, in which case said surplus may be



                                       47
<PAGE>   53

retained by Lender to be applied to the Obligations. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section to the contrary, Borrower shall pay any Imposition or
Claim which it might otherwise be entitled to contest if an Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, or if, in the reasonable determination of Lender,
the Property is in danger of being forfeited or foreclosed. If Borrower refuses
to pay any such Imposition or Claim, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to)
make such payment and Borrower shall reimburse Lender on demand for all such
advances.

SECTION 5.4 MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. Borrower will maintain or cause to be
maintained, with financially sound and reputable insurers, public liability,
property damage, business interruption and other types of insurance with respect
to its business and the Property (including all Improvements now existing or
hereafter erected thereon) in such amounts and for such periods and against all
losses, hazards, casualties, liabilities and contingencies as customarily
carried or maintained by Persons of established reputation engaged in similar
businesses. Without limitation of the foregoing, Borrower shall maintain or
cause to be maintained policies of insurance with respect to the Property in the
following amounts and covering the following risks:

             (i) Property damage insurance covering loss or damage to the

including the standard "all risks" clauses, with such endorsements as Lender may
from time to time reasonably require including, without limitation, building
ordinance and law (including demolition costs and increased cost of construction
coverage), lightning, windstorm, civil commotion, hail, riot, strike, water
damage, sprinkler leakage, collapse and malicious mischief. Such policy shall be
in an amount not less than that necessary to comply with any coinsurance
percentage stipulated in the policy, but not less than 100% of the full
replacement cost of all Improvements (without any deduction for depreciation),
and shall contain replacement cost and agreed amount endorsements each in an
amount not less than the outstanding principal amount of the Loan. The
deductible under such policy shall not exceed $100,000.

             (ii) Broad form boiler and machinery insurance in an amount equal
to the full replacement cost of the Improvements (without any deduction for
depreciation) in which the boiler or similar vessel is located, and including
coverage against loss or damage from (1) leakage or sprinkler systems and (2)
damage, breakdown or explosion of steam boilers, electrical machinery and
equipment, air conditioning, refrigeration, pressure vessels or similar
apparatus and mechanical objects now or hereafter installed at the Property.

             (iii) If the Property is in an area prone to geological phenomena,
including, but not limited to, sinkholes, mine subsidence or earthquakes,
insurance covering such risks in an amount not less than $100,000,000, and with
a maximum permissible deductible of $100,000.

             (iv) Flood insurance if the Property is in an area now or hereafter
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a Zone "A" & "V"
Special Hazard Area, or such other Special Hazard Area if Lender so requires in
its sole discretion. Such policy shall be



                                       48
<PAGE>   54

in an amount not less than $50,000,000, and shall have a maximum permissible
deductible of $100,000.

             (v) Business interruption or rent loss insurance in an amount equal
to the anticipated gross income or rentals from the Property (assuming an
occupancy rate of 100%) for an indemnity period commencing on the date of the
casualty and ending at least ninety (90) days after completion of the
Restoration (but with no maximum limit on the overall length of such indemnity
period), such amount being adjusted annually. Lender shall be named as loss
payee under such insurance.

             (vi) During any period of reconstruction, renovation or alteration
of the Property in excess of 10% of the outstanding principal balance of the
Loan, a completed value, "All Risks" Builders Risk form or "Course of
Construction" insurance policy in non-reporting form and in an amount not less
than the lesser of 100% of the full replacement cost of all Improvements and the
then outstanding principal balance of the Loan.

             (vii) Commercial general liability insurance against claims for
personal and bodily injury (including death resulting therefrom) to one or more
persons or property damage, occurring on, in or about the Property (including
the adjoining streets, sidewalks and passageways) in such amounts as Lender may
from time to time reasonably require, but not less than $25,000,000 for each
occurrence and $50,000,000 in the aggregate, and with deductibles reasonably
acceptable to Lender. This policy or policies must include coverage for premises
and operations liability, products and completed operations liability,
contractual liability, hired, owned and non-owned automobile liability,
innkeepers legal liability and "Dram shop" or other liquor liability if
alcoholic beverages are sold from or may be consumed at the Property.

             (viii) If required by applicable state laws, worker's compensation
or employer's liability insurance in accordance with such laws.

             (ix) Borrower and Manager shall maintain fidelity insurance and
professional liability insurance in amounts reasonably satisfactory to Lender in
its sole discretion in event against losses resulting from dishonest or
fraudulent acts committed by Borrower's and Manager's personnel, employees and
agents.

             (x) Such other insurance and endorsements, if any, as Lender may
reasonably require from time to time, and which is then customarily required by
institutional lenders for similar properties similarly situated, against other
insurable hazards, including, but not limited to, malicious mischief, vandalism
or windstorm, which at the time are commonly insured against and generally
available in the case of properties similarly situated, due regard to be given
to the size and type of the Property.

             Each carrier providing any insurance, or portion thereof, required
by this Section shall be licensed to do business in the jurisdiction or
jurisdictions in which the Property is located, and shall have a claims paying
ability rating and/or financial strength rating, as applicable, by S&P of not
less than "AA", by Moody's of not less than "Aa2" and by Fitch of not less than
"AA" and an A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") rating of not less than A and
financial size category of not less than XIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender hereby



                                       49
<PAGE>   55

approves: (a) Industrial Risk Insurers (ERC Group) as the carrier providing the
insurance required under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (first $20,000,000 of
coverage) and (v) of this Section 5.4 so long as such carrier meets the S&P,
Moody's and A.M. Best ratings requirements above, (b) Gulf Insurance Co. as the
insurer providing flood insurance under clause (iv) (excess coverage of
$30,000,000) of this Section 5.4 so long as such carrier meets the S&P ratings
requirement and maintains an A.M. Best rating of not less than A+/IX, (c) Royal
Specialty as the insurer providing a portion of the liability under clause (vii)
of this Section 5.4 (first $4,000,000 over $1,000,000 Borrower's self-insured
deductible) so long as such carrier maintains a claims paying ability rating by
S&P of not less than "A" and by Fitch of not less than "AA-" and an A.M. Best
rating of not less than A/XIV, and (d) American Alternative Insurance Co. as the
carrier providing a portion of the liability insurance under clause (vii) (next
$25,000,000 over the liability coverage provided by the insurer referenced in
clause (c) above) so long as such insurer meets the S&P and A.M. Best
requirements above. In the event that any of the insurance provided by the
insurers referenced above shall hereafter be provided by another insurance
carrier, any such carrier shall thereafter be required to fully comply with the
ratings requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph. Borrower shall
cause all insurance (except general public liability and worker's compensation
insurance) carried in accordance with this Section to be payable to Lender as a
mortgagee "as its interests may appear" and not as a coinsured, and, in the case
of all policies of insurance carried by each lessee for the benefit of Borrower,
if any, to cause all such policies to be payable to Lender as Lender's interest
may appear.

             All insurance policies and renewals thereof (i) shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Lender, (ii) shall provide for a term of not less than
one year, (iii) shall provide by way of endorsement, rider or otherwise that
such insurance policy shall not be canceled, endorsed, altered, or reissued to
effect a change in coverage unless such insurer shall have first given Lender
thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof, (iv) shall include a standard
non-contributory mortgagee endorsement or its equivalent in favor of and in form
acceptable to Lender, (v) shall provide for claims to be made on an occurrence
basis, except that boiler and machinery coverage may be made on an accident
basis, (vi) shall contain an agreed value clause updated annually (if the amount
of coverage under such policy is based upon the replacement cost of the
Property) and (vii) to the extent not specified above, shall have deductibles in
amounts reasonably acceptable to Lender. All property damage insurance policies
(except for flood and earthquake policies) must automatically reinstate after
each loss.

             The insurance coverage required under this Section 5.4 may be
effected under a blanket policy or policies covering the Property and other
properties and assets owned by Affiliates of Borrower; provided that any such
blanket policy shall specify any sublimits in such blanket policy applicable to
the Property, which amounts shall not be less than the amounts required pursuant
to this Section 5.4 and which shall in any case comply in all other respects
with the requirements of this Section 5.4. Upon Lender's request which shall not
be more frequently than once for any twelve (12) month period, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender a certificate setting forth (i) the number of properties
covered by such blanket policy or policies, (ii) the location by city (if
available, otherwise, county) and state of the properties, (iii) the average
square footage of the properties (or the aggregate square footage), (iv) a brief
description of the typical construction type included in the blanket policy and
(v) such other information as Lender may reasonably request. Borrower covenants
and agrees that, at all times, the aggregate coverage under such policy or
policies shall be not less than the amount of insurance which



                                       50
<PAGE>   56

would be required for all properties covered by such blanket policy or policies
(including the Property) under Sections 5.4(i), (ii) and (v) if such properties
were covered by this Agreement.

             Borrower may maintain a portion of the commercial general liability
insurance required under Section 5.4(vii) above in an amount not to exceed
$1,000,000 per occurrence and a portion of the worker's compensation insurance
required under Section 5.4(viii) in an amount not to exceed $300,000 per
occurrence by means of a self-insurance program, the terms and conditions of
which shall be reasonably acceptable to Lender. Borrower shall at all times
maintain cash reserves in the Self-Insurance Reserve Account in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.7 and the Cash Management Agreement. Promptly after
Lender's written request therefor, Borrower shall provide Lender with any and
all information reasonably requested by Lender with respect to such
self-insurance program including, without limitation, information regarding the
balance of and activity in the Self-Insurance Reserve Account, claims paid
during any period and pending and threatened claims.

SECTION 5.5 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTY; CASUALTY.

         (A) Borrower will operate and maintain the Property as a first class
hotel and maintain or cause to be maintained in good repair, working order and
condition all material property used in the business of Borrower, including the
Property, and will make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals
and replacements thereof consistent with Borrower's normal and customary
operations at the Property (provided that such operations are consistent with
standards for a first class hotel). Without limitation of the foregoing,
Borrower will operate and maintain the Property substantially in accordance with
the applicable Operating Budget and the FF&E Budget. All work required or
permitted under this Loan Agreement shall be performed in a workmanlike manner
and in compliance with all applicable laws.

So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower may,
without Lender's consent, perform alterations to the Property which (i) do not
constitute a Material Alteration, (ii) do not materially and adversely affect
Borrower's financial condition or the value or Net Operating Income of the
Property and (iii) are in the ordinary course of Borrower's business. Borrower
shall not perform any Material Alteration without Lender's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, however, that Lender may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, withhold consent to any Material Alteration which is likely to
result in a decrease of Net Operating Income from the Property by 5% or more for
a period of 30 days or longer. Lender may, as a condition to giving its consent
to a Material Alteration, require that Borrower deliver to Lender evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Lender that Borrower has cash available for payment
of the cost of such Material Alteration or, if Borrower fails to deliver such
evidence, cash in an amount equal to 125% of the cost of such Material
Alteration as reasonably estimated by Lender. Cash deposited by Borrower with
Lender in connection with any Material Alteration pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall be held by Lender in an interest-bearing account and disbursed to
Borrower to pay for the cost of such Material Alteration as such work progresses
subject to satisfaction of the conditions for disbursement of amounts from the
FF&E Reserve under Section 6.4(B). Upon substantial completion of the Material
Alteration, Borrower shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender
that (i) the Material Alteration was constructed in accordance with all
applicable laws and substantially in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by Lender (which



                                       51
<PAGE>   57

approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) all contractors,
subcontractors, materialmen and professionals who provided work, materials or
services in connection with the Material Alteration have been paid in full and
have delivered unconditional releases of lien and (iii) all material licenses
necessary for the use, operation and occupancy of the Material Alteration (other
than those which depend on the performance of tenant improvement work) have been
issued. Borrower shall reimburse Lender upon demand for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees of any
architect, engineer or other professional engaged by Lender) incurred by Lender
in reviewing plans and specifications or in making any determinations necessary
to implement the provisions of this Section 5.5(A). Notwithstanding Lender's
approval of any Capital Improvement Plan under Section 5.1, Borrower shall be
required to satisfy all of the above conditions with respect to any Material
Alteration included in such Capital Improvement Plan except to the extent such
Material Alteration is to be paid for from the Capital Improvement Reserve under
Section 6.5.

         (B) In the event of casualty or loss at the Property, Borrower shall
give immediate written notice of the same to the insurance carrier and to Lender
and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute to completion, in
accordance with the terms hereof, the repair and restoration of the Property as
nearly as possible to the Pre-Existing Condition (hereinafter defined) (a
"RESTORATION"). Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not
such costs are covered by insurance. Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers
Lender as attorney-in-fact for Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and
compromise any claim under insurance policies, to appear in and prosecute any
action arising from such insurance policies, to collect and receive insurance
proceeds, and to deduct therefrom Lender's expenses incurred in the collection
of such proceeds; provided however, that nothing contained in this Section shall
require Lender to incur any expense or take any action hereunder. Borrower
further authorizes Lender, at Lender's option, (i) to hold the balance of such
proceeds to be used to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration of the
Property or (ii) subject to Subsection 5.5(C), to apply such proceeds to payment
of the Obligations whether or not then due, in any order, and provided that no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no Prepayment Consideration
shall be payable in connection with such application of proceeds to the
Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a casualty where the
loss does not exceed the Restoration Threshold, Borrower may settle and adjust
such claim; provided that (a) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
and (b) such adjustment is carried out in a commercially reasonable and timely
manner.

         (C) Lender shall not exercise Lender's option to apply insurance
proceeds to payment of the Obligations if all of the following conditions are
met: (i) no Event of Default then exists; (ii) Lender reasonably determines that
there will be sufficient funds to complete the Restoration of the Property to at
least the Pre-Existing Condition and to timely make all payments due under the
Loan Documents during the Restoration of the Property; (iii) Lender reasonably
determines that the Net Operating Income of the Property (including rental
income or business interruption insurance) will be sufficient to pay principal
and interest on the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan and Operating Revenues of the
Property, after the Restoration thereof to the Pre-Existing Condition, will be
sufficient to meet all Operating Expenses, payments for Reserves and payments of
principal and interest under the Note and the Mezzanine Loan and maintain a Debt
Service Coverage Ratio at least equal to the lesser of (a) the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio as of the Closing Date and (b) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
immediately prior to the casualty; (iv)



                                       52
<PAGE>   58

Lender determines that the Restoration of the Property to the Pre-Existing
Condition will be completed within one (1) year of the date of the loss or
casualty to the Property, but in no event later than six (6) months prior to the
Maturity Date (giving effect to the next unexercised Extension Option, provided
that Borrower exercises such Extension Option at the time in question, subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.5(B) (other than
delivery of notice under Section 2.5(B)(i)); (v) less than fifty percent (50%)
of the total floor area of the Improvements has been damaged, destroyed or
rendered unusable as a result of such fire or other casualty; (vi) the total
amount of insurance proceeds available in connection with such fire or casualty
does not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding principal balance
of the Loan; and (vii) Lender is reasonably satisfied that the Property can be
restored and repaired as nearly as possible to the condition it was in
immediately prior to such casualty and in compliance with all applicable zoning,
building and other laws and codes (the "PRE-EXISTING CONDITION").

         (D) If Lender elects or is obligated to make the insurance proceeds
available for the Restoration of the Property, Borrower agrees that, if at any
time during the Restoration, the cost of completing such Restoration, as
reasonably determined by Lender, exceeds the undisbursed insurance proceeds,
Borrower shall, immediately upon demand by Lender, deposit the amount of such
excess with Lender, and Lender shall first disburse such deposit to pay for the
costs of such Restoration on the same terms and conditions as the insurance
proceeds are disbursed. If Borrower deposits such excess with Lender and if,
after completion of the Restoration, any funds remain from the combination of
insurance proceeds and the funds so deposited with Lender by Borrower, and if no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Lender shall
disburse to Borrower such remaining funds.

         (E) Lender may, at Lender's option, condition disbursement of any
insurance proceeds on Lender's approval of plans and specifications of an
independent architect licensed in the state where the Property is located and
reasonably satisfactory to Lender (the "ARCHITECT"), any and all contractors,
subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration and the contracts
under which they have been engaged, contractor's cost estimates, architect's
certificates, waivers of liens, sworn statements of mechanics and materialmen
and such other evidence of costs, percentage completion of construction,
application of payments, and satisfaction of liens as Lender may reasonably
require. Lender shall not be obligated to disburse insurance proceeds more
frequently than once every calendar month. If insurance proceeds are applied to
the payment of the Obligations, any such application of proceeds to principal
shall not extend or postpone the due dates of the monthly payments due under the
Note or otherwise under the Loan Documents, or change the amounts of such
payments. Any amount of insurance proceeds remaining in Lender's possession
after full and final payment and discharge of all Obligations shall be refunded
to Borrower or otherwise paid in accordance with applicable law. If the Property
is sold at foreclosure or if Lender acquires title to the Property, Lender shall
have all of the right, title and interest of Borrower in and to any insurance
policies and unearned premiums thereon and in and to the proceeds resulting from
any damage to the Property prior to such sale or acquisition.

         (F) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
insurance proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred
from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by
the Architect, less a retainage equal to ten



                                       53
<PAGE>   59

percent (10%) of such costs incurred until the Restoration has been completed.
The retainage shall in no event be less than the amount actually held back by
Borrower from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the
Restoration. The retainage shall not be released until the Architect certifies
to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 5.5 and that all approvals necessary for the
re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all appropriate
governmental authorities, and Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender
that the costs of the Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full
out of the retainage.

SECTION 5.6 INSPECTION. Borrower shall permit any authorized representatives
designated by Lender to visit and inspect during normal business hours the
Property and its business, including its financial and accounting records, and
to make copies and take extracts therefrom (not to exceed four times per year
unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), and to discuss its
affairs, finances and business with its officers and independent public
accountants (with such Borrower's representative(s) present), at such reasonable
times during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably requested.
Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall provide
advance written notice of at least three (3) Business Days prior to visiting or
inspecting the Property or Borrower's offices.

SECTION 5.7 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.

         (A) ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Borrower shall at all times comply in all
material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws. Borrower shall not:
(i) violate in any material respect any applicable Environmental Law; or (ii)
generate, use, transport, handle, store, release or dispose of any Hazardous
Materials in or into, on or onto, or from the Property (except in accordance
with applicable law); or (iii) permit any Lien imposed pursuant to any
Environmental Law to be imposed or to remain on the Property.

         (B) REMEDIAL ACTION. Borrower shall promptly take and diligently
prosecute any and all necessary remedial actions upon obtaining knowledge of the
presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation, active or passive migration,
release or discharge of any Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Property
in violation of any Environmental Laws. In the event Borrower undertakes any
remedial action with respect to any Hazardous Material on, under or about the
Property, Borrower shall conduct and complete such remedial action in compliance
with all applicable Environmental Laws, and in accordance with the applicable
policies, orders and directives of all federal, state and local governmental
authorities.

         (C) FURTHER ASSURANCE. If Lender at any time has a reasonable basis to
believe that there may be a violation of any Environmental Law by, or any basis
for a material claim or liability arising thereunder of, Borrower or related to
the Property, then Borrower agrees, upon request from Lender, to provide Lender
with such reports, certificates, engineering studies or other written material
or data as Lender may reasonably require so as to satisfy Lender that Borrower
and the Property are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.

         (D) O&M PLAN. Borrower has caused to be prepared and delivered to
Lender an operations and maintenance program with respect to suspected asbestos
and asbestos-containing materials (the "O&M PLAN") located in the Property as
set forth in the Environmental Report.



                                       54
<PAGE>   60

Borrower shall at all times implement and carry out the O&M Plan in accordance
with its terms. Lender's requirement that Borrower develop and comply with the
O&M Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or modification of any
covenants or agreements of Borrower or Guarantor with respect to Hazardous
Material or Environmental Laws as set forth herein or in the Environmental
Indemnity.

SECTION 5.8 ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE.

         (A) Borrower shall promptly upon becoming aware thereof advise Lender
in writing and in reasonable detail of: (1) any release, disposal or discharge
of any Hazardous Material on, under, or about the Property required to be
reported to any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory agency under
any applicable Environmental Laws except such releases, disposals or discharges
pursuant to and in compliance with valid permits, authorizations or
registrations under said Environmental Laws; (2) any and all written
communications sent or received by Borrower with respect to any Environmental
Claims or any release, disposal or discharge of Hazardous Material required to
be reported to any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory agency;
(3) any remedial action taken by Borrower or any other Person in response to any
Hazardous Material on, under or about the Property, the existence of which could
result in an Environmental Claim that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (4) the discovery by Borrower of any occurrence or
condition on any real property adjoining or in the vicinity of the Property that
could reasonably be expected to cause the Property or any part thereof to be
subject to any restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, transferability or use
thereof under any Environmental Laws; and (5) any request for information from
any governmental agency that indicates such agency is investigating whether
Borrower may be potentially responsible for a release, disposal or discharge of
Hazardous Materials.

         (B) Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of any proposed action to be
taken pertaining in any way to the Property to commence any operations that
could reasonably be expected to subject Borrower or the Property to additional
laws, rules or regulations, including laws, rules and regulations requiring
additional or amended environmental permits or licenses which could reasonably
be expected to subject Borrower to any material obligations or requirements
under any Environmental Laws. Borrower shall, at its own expense, provide copies
of such documents or information as Lender may reasonably request in relation to
any matters disclosed pursuant to this Section.

SECTION 5.9 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. Borrower will (A)
comply with the requirements of all present and future applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders of any governmental authority in all jurisdictions in
which it is now doing business or may hereafter be doing business, other than
those laws, rules, regulations and orders the noncompliance with which would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) maintain all licenses and permits now held or
hereafter acquired by Borrower, the loss, suspension, or revocation of which, or
failure to renew, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
and (C) perform, observe, comply and fulfill all of its obligations, covenants
and conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation except where the failure
to so perform, observe or comply would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, including the Loan Documents.



                                       55
<PAGE>   61

SECTION 5.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrower Parties and their Affiliates shall,
from time to time, execute and/or deliver such documents, instruments,
agreements, financing statements, and perform such acts as Lender at any time
may reasonably request to evidence, preserve and/or protect the Collateral at
any time securing or intended to secure the Obligations and/or to better and
more effectively carry out the purposes of this Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

SECTION 5.11 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS AND LEASES. Each Borrower Party shall
duly and punctually perform, observe and comply in all material respects with
all of the terms, provisions, conditions, covenants and agreements on its part
to be performed, observed and complied with (i) hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents to which it is a party, (ii) under all Material Agreements and
Material Leases and (iii) all other agreements entered into or assumed by such
Person in connection with the Property, and will not suffer or permit any
material default or event of default (giving effect to any applicable notice
requirements and cure periods) to exist under any of the foregoing except where
the failure to perform, observe or comply with any agreement referred to in this
clause (iii) would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Borrower shall comply with, observe and perform all of Borrower's obligations as
landlord under all Leases and shall enforce the terms, covenants and conditions
contained in the Leases upon the part of the tenants thereunder to be observed
or performed.

SECTION 5.12 LEASES. (A) Without the prior written consent of Lender, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Borrower shall not, nor allow
Manager or any other Person to, (i) enter into any Material Lease; (ii) cancel
or terminate any Material Lease (except to enforce any such Material Lease after
a default thereunder); (iii) amend or modify any Material Lease (except for
minor modifications and amendments entered into in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with prudent property management practices, not materially
and adversely affecting the economic terms of the Material Lease); (iv) approve
any assignment, sublease or underlease of any Material Lease (except as required
pursuant to the express terms of any existing Material Lease or Material Lease
hereafter approved by Lender); or (v) cancel or modify any guaranty, or release
any security deposit, letter of credit, or other item constituting security
pertaining to any Material Lease.

         (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.12(A) above, Lender's
consent shall not be required for the creation, assignment, termination,
amendment or modification of any Lease which is not a Material Lease provided
that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and that the
applicable Lease (other than any Deminimis Lease):

             (i) provides for payment of a net effective rent (after taking into
account any free rent, construction allowances or other concessions granted by
landlord) no less than ninety percent (90%) of the then effective fair market
rent then prevailing for similar properties and leases in the market area;

             (ii) is otherwise on commercially reasonable terms; and

             (iii) is delivered to Lender within twenty (20) days after
execution with Borrower's certification that such Lease satisfies the conditions
of this Section 5.12.



                                       56
<PAGE>   62

         (C) Any request for approval of a Material Lease or assignment,
termination, amendment or modification of any Material Lease shall be made to
Lender in writing and together with such request Borrower shall furnish to
Lender: (i) such biographical and financial information about the proposed
tenant as Lender may reasonably require in conjunction with its review, (ii) a
copy of the proposed form of Lease (or amendment or modification), and (iii) a
summary of the material terms of such proposed Lease (or amendment or
modification) including, without limitation, rental terms and the term of the
proposed Lease and any options.

             Except for security deposits, no Lease (other than Deminimis
Leases) shall provide for payment of rent more than one month in advance, and
Borrower shall not under any circumstances collect any such rent more than one
month in advance. Borrower, at Lender's request, shall furnish Lender with
executed copies of all Leases (other than Deminimis Leases) hereafter made. Each
Lease (other than Deminimis Leases) or a separate agreement with the tenant of
such Lease, in recordable form and substance satisfactory to Lender, shall
specifically provide that such Lease is subordinate to the Deed of Trust; that
the tenant attorns to Lender, such attornment to be effective upon Lender's
acquisition of title to the Property; that the tenant agrees to execute such
further evidences of attornment as Lender may from time to time request; that
the attornment of the tenant shall not be terminated by foreclosure; that in no
event shall Lender, as holder of the Deed of Trust or as successor landlord, be
liable to the tenant for any act or omission of any prior landlord or for any
liability or obligation of any prior landlord occurring prior to the date that
Lender or any subsequent owner acquire title to the Property; and that Lender
may, at Lender's option, accept or reject such attornment. Lender shall enter
into, and, if required by applicable law to provide constructive notice, record
in the county where the subject Property is located, and permit the applicable
tenant to record a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement, in
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B, with any tenant (other than an Affiliate
of Borrower) entering into any Material Lease within ten (10) Business Days
after written request therefor by Borrower delivered together with an executed
copy of the applicable Material Lease, and provided that Lender shall have
confirmed that such Material Lease satisfies the conditions of this Section
5.12.

SECTION 5.13 MANAGEMENT; FRANCHISE AGREEMENT.

         (A) Borrower shall cause Manager to manage the Property in accordance
with the Management Agreement including, without limitation, maintaining
inventory in amounts and types customary for hotels comparable to the Property.
Borrower shall (i) diligently perform and observe all of the material terms,
covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement on the part of Borrower to
be performed and observed, (ii) promptly notify Lender of any notice to Borrower
of any default under the Management Agreement of which it is aware and (iii)
promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial statement, business plan,
capital expenditures plan, notice, report and estimate received by it under the
Management Agreement. If Borrower shall default in the performance or observance
of any material term, covenant or condition of the Management Agreement on the
part of Borrower to be performed or observed, then, without limiting Lender's
other rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and
without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder or
under the Management Agreement, Lender shall have the right, but shall be under
no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any act as may be appropriate to
cause all the material terms, covenants and conditions of the Management
Agreement on the part of Borrower to be



                                       57

with Manager or any new Manager, or consent to the assignment by the Manager of
its interest under the Management Agreement, in each case without the express
consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
delivery of Rating Confirmations from each of the Rating Agencies. If at any
time Lender consents to the appointment of a new Manager, such new Manager and
Borrower shall, as a condition of Lender's consent, execute a subordination of
management agreement in the form delivered in connection with the closing of the
Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender's consent shall not be required for
appointment of an Acceptable Manager and delivery of Rating Confirmations shall
not be required for appointment of an Acceptable Manager described in clause (i)
of the above definition thereof; provided, however that delivery of Rating
Confirmations shall be required for appointment of an Acceptable Manager
described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof and, in any event, the
Management Agreement with any new Manager including any Acceptable Manager shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender.

         (C) Lender shall have the right to require Borrower to replace the
Manager with a Person chosen by Borrower and reasonably acceptable to Lender,
upon the earliest to occur of any one or more of the following events: (i) upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default; (ii) thirty
(30) days after notice from Lender to Borrower that Manager has engaged in
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct arising from or in connection with
its performance under the Management Agreement; or (iii) upon a change of
control of the current Manager or if at any time the Manager is not an Affiliate
of the Person which is the Manager of the Property on the date hereof.

         (D) Borrower shall not enter into any Franchise Agreement without
Lender's prior written consent as to the franchisor and the terms of the
Franchise Agreement and without delivery of a Rating Confirmation from each of
the Rating Agencies. Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, Lender's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed to any proposed Franchise Agreement with an Acceptable Franchisor for
operation of the Property under an Acceptable Franchise Name as a first class
destination convention center hotel in a manner substantially similar to the
current use and operation of the Property. Borrower shall also be required to
deliver to Lender a comfort letter from the franchisor in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Lender. If Borrower enters into any such Franchise
Agreement, Borrower shall (a) cause the hotel located on the Property to be
operated pursuant to the Franchise Agreement; (b) promptly perform and observe
in all material respects all of the covenants required to be performed and
observed by it under the Franchise Agreement and do all things reasonably
necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights thereunder; (c)
promptly notify Lender of any material default under the Franchise Agreement of
which it is aware; (d) promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each material
financial statement, business plan, capital expenditures plan, notice, report
and estimate received by it under the Franchise Agreement; and (e) promptly
enforce in a commercially reasonable manner the performance and observance of
all of the material covenants required to



                                       58
<PAGE>   64

be performed and observed by the franchisor under the Franchise Agreement. In
addition, Borrower shall not, without Lender's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed: (x) increase
or consent to the increase of the aggregate amount of any fees under any
Franchise Agreement; (y) otherwise modify, change, supplement, alter or amend,
or waive or release any of its material rights and remedies under, any Franchise
Agreement or (z) suffer or permit the occurrence or continuance of a default
beyond any applicable cure period under any Franchise Agreement.

SECTION 5.14 MATERIAL AGREEMENTS. Except for Leases complying with the Loan
Documents, the Management Agreement, the existing Material Agreements described
on Schedule 5.14 attached hereto, the Services Agreements or any Franchise
Agreement complying with the provisions of Section 5.13(D), without Lender's
prior written approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Borrower shall not enter into or become obligated under
any Material Agreement pertaining to the Property, including without limitation
brokerage agreements, unless the same may be terminated without cause and
without payment of a penalty or premium, on not more than thirty (30) days'
prior written notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may enter into
customer contracts for conventions and similar uses of Property facilities
constituting Material Agreements (such contracts, "CONVENTION CONTRACTS")
without Lender's approval provided that (i) any such Convention Contract shall
be substantially in the form of the standard form of Convention Contract
previously delivered to and approved by Lender (with reasonable changes thereto
as necessary to reflect the terms of such contract), and (ii) is otherwise on
Borrower's customary terms.

SECTION 5.15 DEPOSITS; APPLICATION OF RECEIPTS. Borrower will deposit all
Receipts from the Property into, and otherwise comply with, the Accounts

interest has been paid, (iv) whether any offsets or defenses exist against the

nature thereof shall be set forth in detail and (v) that this Loan Agreement,
the Note, the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents are legal, valid and
binding obligations of Borrower and have not been modified or amended, or if
modified or amended, describing such modification or amendments.

         (B) Within ten (10) Business Days following a written request by
Borrower, Lender shall provide to Borrower for informational purposes only, a
duly acknowledged written statement setting forth the amount of the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan, the date to which interest has been paid, and
whether Lender has provided Borrower with written notice of any Event of
Default. Compliance by Lender with the requirements of this Section shall be for



                                       59
<PAGE>   65

informational purposes only and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights
or remedies of Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

SECTION 5.17 INDEBTEDNESS. No Primary Borrower Party will directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume, guaranty, or otherwise become or remain directly or
indirectly liable with respect to any Indebtedness except for the following

than the Loan be secured, in whole or in part, by the Property or any portion
thereof or interest therein; and

         (C) that certain loan in the amount of $100,000,000 (the "MEZZANINE

Liens on ownership interests in Borrower in connection with any Mezzanine Loan
in accordance with Section 5.17(C)).

shall not pay any management,



                                       61
<PAGE>   67

consulting, director or similar fees to any Related Person of Borrower or to any

employee of any Borrower Party, except transactions in the ordinary course of
and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the business of Borrower and upon
fair and reasonable terms as set forth in the Services Agreement or as otherwise
fully disclosed to Lender prior to consummation and are no less favorable to
Borrower than would be obtained in a comparable arm's length transaction with a
Person that is not a Related Person of Borrower. Borrower shall not make any
payment or permit any payment to be made to any Related Person of Borrower when
or as to any time when any Event of Default shall exist.

appointment of or taking possession by, a receiver, trustee or other custodian
for all or a substantial part of the assets of any Borrower Party or Member. As
used in this Loan Agreement, an "INVOLUNTARY BORROWER PARTY BANKRUPTCY" shall
mean any involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, in which
any Borrower Party or Member is a debtor or any portion of the Property is
property of the estate therein. No Borrower Party or Member and no Related
Person of any Borrower Party shall file a petition for, consent to the filing of
a petition for, or aid, solicit, support, or otherwise act, cooperate or collude
to cause the filing of a petition for an Involuntary Borrower Party Bankruptcy.
In any Involuntary Borrower Party Bankruptcy, neither any Borrower Party, nor
Member or any Related Person of any Borrower Party shall, without the prior

any Borrower Party, nor Member or any such Related Person shall file or support
any plan of reorganization. Each Borrower Party and Member having any interest

requested by Lender to assist Lender in obtaining such relief as Lender shall
seek, and shall in all events vote as directed by Lender. Without limitation of
the foregoing, each such Borrower Party and Member shall do all things
reasonably requested by Lender to support any motion for relief from stay or
plan of reorganization proposed or supported by Lender.

prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC; or
(ii) permit the establishment of any Employee Benefit Plan providing

ERISA Affiliate or increase the obligation of Borrower, except for the existing
Plans that currently provide post-retirement welfare benefits as set forth on
Schedule 4.14 attached hereto.

         (C) NO PLAN ASSETS. Borrower shall not at any time during the term of
this Loan Agreement become (1) an employee benefit plan defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA which is subject to ERISA, (2) a plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(1)
of the IRC which is subject to Section 4975 of the IRC, (3) a "governmental

SECTION 5.25 LENDER'S EXPENSES. Borrower shall pay, on demand by Lender, all
reasonable expenses, charges, costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) in connection with the negotiation, documentation, closing,
administration, servicing, enforcement interpretation, and collection of the
Loan and the Loan Documents, and in the preservation and protection of Lender's
rights hereunder and thereunder. Without limitation Borrower shall pay all costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by Lender in any
case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code (or any law succeeding or replacing

proceeds of the Loan any or all of the foregoing expenses then or theretofore
incurred.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                    RESERVES

SECTION 6.1 SECURITY INTEREST IN RESERVES; OTHER MATTERS PERTAINING TO RESERVES.

         (A) Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to Lender a security
interest in and to all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the
Reserves, as security for payment and performance of all of the Obligations
hereunder and under the Note and the other Loan Documents. The Reserves
constitute Account Collateral and are subject to the security interest in favor
of Lender created herein and all provisions of this Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents pertaining to Account Collateral.

         (B) In addition to the rights and remedies provided in Article VII and
elsewhere herein, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender shall have
all rights and remedies pertaining to the Reserves as are provided for in any of
the Loan Documents or under any



                                       63
<PAGE>   69

applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, upon and at all times after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender in its sole
and absolute discretion, may use the Reserves (or any portion thereof) for any
purpose, including but not limited to any combination of the following: (i)
payment of any of the Obligations including the Prepayment Consideration
applicable upon such payment in such order as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion; provided, however, that such application of funds shall not cure or
be deemed to cure any default; (ii) reimbursement of Lender for any losses or
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) suffered or
incurred as a result of such default; (iii) payment for the work or obligation
for which such Reserves were reserved or were required to be reserved; and (iv)
application of the Reserves in connection with the exercise of any and all
rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under this Loan
Agreement or pursuant to any of the other Loan Documents. Nothing contained in
this Loan Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the
funds contained in the Reserves during the continuance of an Event of Default to
payment of the Loan or in any specific order of priority.

SECTION 6.2 FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH LENDER.

         (A) INTEREST, OFFSETS. Except only as expressly provided otherwise
herein, all funds of Borrower which are deposited with Lender as Reserves
hereunder shall be held by Lender in one or more Permitted Investments. Lender
is authorized to commingle any of the Reserves with each other. All interest
which accrues on the Reserves shall be taxable to Borrower and shall be added to
and disbursed in the same manner and under the same conditions as the principal
sum on which said interest accrued. Additional provisions pertaining to
investments are set forth in Article VII. After repayment of all of the
Obligations, all funds held as Reserves will be returned to Borrower.

         (B) FUNDING AT CLOSING. Borrower shall deposit with Lender the amounts
necessary to fund each of the Reserves as set forth below. Deposits into the
Reserves at Closing may occur by deduction from the amount of the Loan that
otherwise would be disbursed to Borrower, followed by prompt deposit of the same
into the applicable Sub-Account of the Central Account in accordance with the
Cash Management Agreement. Notwithstanding such deductions, the Loan shall be
deemed for all purposes to be fully disbursed at Closing.

SECTION 6.3 IMPOSITIONS AND INSURANCE RESERVE. On the Closing Date, Borrower
shall deposit with Lender (or the Servicer or such agent of Lender as Lender may
designate in writing to Borrower from time to time) $1,354,668 and, pursuant to
the Cash Management Agreement, Borrower shall deposit monthly, on each Payment
Date commencing on April 30, 2001, 1/12th of the annual charges (as reasonably
estimated by Lender) for all Impositions and all Insurance Premiums payable with
respect to the Property hereunder (said funds, together with any interest
thereon and additions thereto, the "IMPOSITIONS AND INSURANCE RESERVE"). For
purposes of this Section 6.3, the amount of Insurance Premiums required to be
escrowed hereunder shall be calculated assuming that the insurance coverages
required under Section 5.4 are maintained for the Property on a stand alone
basis (rather than as part of blanket policies covering the Property and other
properties of Borrower's Affiliates) (such insurance policies, "STAND ALONE
INSURANCE POLICIES") as determined by Lender in its sole good faith discretion.
The initial amount of the monthly deposit to be made to the Impositions and
Insurance Reserve from and after the date hereof is $688,000. Borrower shall
also deposit with Lender on demand, to be added to and



                                       64
<PAGE>   70

included within such reserve, a sum of money which Lender reasonably estimates,
together with such monthly deposits, will be sufficient to make the payment of
each such charge at least thirty (30) days prior to the date initially due or,
with respect to Impositions, the date same become delinquent. Borrower shall
provide Lender with tax bills and all other documents necessary for the payment
of Impositions at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which each payment
of Impositions shall first become due. So long as (i) no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, (ii) Borrower has provided Lender with the foregoing
tax bills and other documents in a timely manner, and (iii) sufficient funds are
held by Lender for the payment of the Impositions relating to the Property,
Lender shall pay said Impositions or disburse to Borrower from such Reserve an
amount sufficient to pay said Impositions. Borrower shall also provide
certificates of insurance or other evidence of renewal (including evidence of
payment) of the insurance policies required to be maintained under Section 5.4
at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the expiration of each of such
insurance policies. If Borrower fails to deliver such certificates of insurance
or other evidence of renewal and payment within the above time period, Lender
may use funds available in the Impositions and Insurance Reserve to purchase
Stand Alone Insurance Policies for the Property on Borrower's behalf. Borrower
hereby appoints Lender as Borrower's attorney-in-fact for such purposes, which
power of attorney is coupled with an interest and irrevocable. If the amount
then held in the Impositions and Insurance Reserve on account of Insurance
Premiums shall be less than the actual insurance premiums payable for such Stand
Alone Insurance Policies, Borrower shall be required to pay (or reimburse Lender
for) such deficiency within two (2) Business Days after request therefor from
Lender. If Borrower provides such certificates of insurance or evidence of
renewal and payment within the above time period, then Lender shall disburse to
Borrower the amount then held in the Impositions and Insurance Reserve on
account of the portion of Insurance Premiums attributable to the insurance
policies for which such evidence of renewal was delivered.

SECTION 6.4 FF&E RESERVE. Pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement, Borrower
shall deposit with Lender (or its Servicer or agent) monthly, on each Payment
Date commencing with April 30, 2001, the Monthly FF&E Payment (as hereinafter
defined), for the purpose of creating a reserve for Approved FF&E Expenditures
(as hereinafter defined) and Replacements in accordance with the applicable FF&E
Budget approved by Lender (said funds, together with any interest thereon and
additions thereto, the "FF&E RESERVE"). The amount to be deposited by Borrower
with Lender in the FF&E Reserve on each Payment Date (such amount, the "MONTHLY
FF&E PAYMENT") shall be equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of 4.0% of the Operating
Revenues (excluding service charges) generated from the Property for the prior
calendar year (the "MEASUREMENT YEAR"); provided that until Operating Revenues
for any Measurement Year have been determined, Borrower shall continue to make
Monthly FF&E Payments in the succeeding calendar year in the amount in effect
for the applicable prior year. The initial amount of the Monthly FF&E Payment to
be made to the FF&E Reserve from and after the date hereof is $749,853. Upon
determination of Operating Revenues for the Measurement Year, the required
Monthly FF&E Payments for the succeeding calendar year shall be recalculated and
Borrower shall be required to deposit into the FF&E Reserve, within ten (10)
Business Days after such determination, any shortfall between such required
Monthly FF&E Payments and the actual Monthly FF&E Payments theretofore made by
Borrower in such year. If the actual Monthly FF&E Payments theretofore made by
Borrower in any year exceed the required Monthly FF&E Payments as recalculated
based on the actual Operating Revenues for the Measurement Year, the amount of
such excess shall be applied as a credit against future Monthly FF&E Payments as



                                       65
<PAGE>   71

they become due hereunder. Borrower shall be required to perform the capital
repairs and improvements to the Property during the calendar years 2001 and 2002
as described on Schedule 6.4 (the "REQUIRED REPAIRS"). In addition to the
Required Repairs, Borrower shall also perform such capital repairs, improvements
and replacements of FF&E (the "REPLACEMENTS") that are reasonably necessary or
appropriate in accordance with sound hotel management practices in order to keep
the Property in good operating condition and repair consistent with other first
class convention center hotel properties, and to keep the Property or any
portion thereof from deteriorating. Upon Borrower's request for disbursement,
Lender shall disburse funds from the FF&E Reserve to or for the account of
Borrower, to reimburse Borrower for the amount of Borrower's actual bona fide
out-of-pocket expenditures for (i) Required Repairs and (ii) Replacements which
are consistent with the FF&E Budget and which are not part of the Capital
Improvement Plan ("APPROVED FF&E EXPENDITURES"), on the Payment Date following
such request, upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the conditions listed on
Schedule 6.6 and each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.6.

SECTION 6.5 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE; REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. At
Closing, Borrower shall reserve from the proceeds of the Loan and shall deposit
with Lender (or its Servicer or agent) $20,000,000 (said funds, together with
any interest thereon, the "CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE"), which funds shall be
made available to Borrower solely for payment of certain Capital Improvements
required to be made to the Property and designated as "Required Capital
Improvements" on the Capital Improvement Plan attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS") (or other Capital Improvements approved by
Lender in its reasonable discretion) and shall not be used by Borrower for
purposes for which any other Reserve is established. Borrower shall promptly
commence and diligently prosecute completion of the Required Capital
Improvements within twenty-four (24) months after the date hereof. Upon
Borrower's request for disbursement, Lender shall disburse funds from the
Capital Improvement Reserve to or for the account of Borrower, to reimburse
Borrower for the amount of Borrower's actual bona fide out-of-pocket
expenditures for such Required Capital Improvements ("APPROVED CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT EXPENDITURES"), on the Payment Date following such request, upon
satisfaction by Borrower of each of the conditions listed on Schedule 6.6 and
each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.6. Subject to the foregoing
conditions, any remaining balance in the Capital Improvement Reserve after the
Required Capital Improvements under the Capital Improvement Plan have been
completed to Lender's reasonable satisfaction and paid for shall be promptly
disbursed to Borrower.

SECTION 6.6 CONDITIONS TO DISBURSEMENTS FROM FF&E RESERVE AND CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT RESERVE; PERFORMANCE OF WORK.

         (A) DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE FF&E RESERVE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
RESERVE. Upon Borrower's request for disbursement, Lender shall disburse funds
from the FF&E Reserve or the Capital Improvement Reserve (such Reserves, the
"WORK RESERVES") to or for the account of Borrower, to reimburse Borrower for
Approved FF&E Expenditures or Approved Capital Improvement Expenditures,
respectively (collectively, "APPROVED EXPENDITURES"; and the related
Replacements or Required Capital Improvements to which any such request for
disbursement relates shall be referred to as the "WORK"), on the Payment Date
following such request, upon satisfaction of each of the conditions listed on
Schedule 6.6 and each of the conditions set forth below:



                                       66
<PAGE>   72

             (i) Except as provided in this Section 6.6, each request for
disbursement from the Work Reserves shall be made only after completion of the
Approved Expenditures for which disbursement is requested.

             (ii) If (i) the cost of a particular item of the Approved
Expenditures exceeds $25,000, (ii) the contractor performing such item of the
Approved Expenditures requires periodic payments pursuant to the terms of a
written contract, and (iii) Lender has approved in writing in advance such
periodic payments (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), a
request for disbursement from the Work Reserves may be made after completion of
a portion of the work under such contract, provided (1) such contract requires
payment upon completion of such portion of the work, (2) the materials for which
the request is made are on site at the Property and are properly secured or have
been installed in the Property, (3) all other conditions in this Loan Agreement
for disbursement have been satisfied, (4) funds remaining in the FF&E Reserve
together with the amounts that are scheduled to be deposited therein by Borrower
pursuant to Section 6.4(A) are, in Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to
complete such item of the Replacements and other Replacements when required
and/or funds remaining in the Capital Improvement Reserve are, in Lender's
reasonable judgment, sufficient to complete such item of Required Capital
Improvements and any other Required Capital Improvements remaining to be
performed, as the case may be, and (5) if required by Lender, each contractor or
subcontractor receiving payments under such contract shall provide a waiver of
lien with respect to amounts which have been paid to that contractor or
subcontractor.

             (iii) To the extent the contract with the relevant contractor or
supplier provides for a retainage, each disbursement from a Work Reserve, except
for a final disbursement, shall be in the amount of actual costs incurred less
the percentage of such costs that the contract with the relevant contractor or
supplier specifies to be retained and advanced as part of the final
disbursement. No funds will be advanced for materials stored at the Property
unless such materials are properly stored and secured at the Property in
accordance with Borrower's customary procedures and sound construction practices
as reasonably determined by Lender.

             (iv) The amount of all invoices in connection with the Work with
respect to which a disbursement is requested and which has been approved by
Lender shall be disbursed by Lender either directly to Borrower (in which event,
Borrower covenants and agrees to promptly pay such invoices) or, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, at Lender's option and in Lender's sole
and absolute discretion, directly to the contractor, supplier, materialman,
mechanic or subcontractor indicated on said invoices unless already paid by
Borrower and Lender has received satisfactory evidence of such payment in which
case Lender shall reimburse Borrower. In the event that Borrower requests that
any amounts be disbursed directly to Borrower pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, Borrower shall be required to deliver evidence reasonably acceptable
to Lender of payment of all invoices for which disbursements were previously
made to Borrower as a condition to such requested disbursement.

             (v) No more than one disbursement will be made by Lender from a
Work Reserve in any calendar month and no disbursement will be made on any day
other than a Payment Date. Lender shall not be required to make any disbursement
from a Work Reserve with respect to the Property unless such requested
disbursement is in an amount equal to or greater than $10,000.



                                       67
<PAGE>   73

             (vi) Lender reserves the right, at its option and as a condition to
any disbursement from a Work Reserve, to approve (i) all drawings and plans and
specifications, if any, for any Work which require aggregate payments in amounts
exceeding $500,000 and (ii) all contracts and work orders with materialmen,
mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors and other parties providing
labor or materials in connection with any Work which require aggregate payments
in amounts exceeding $500,000. Any such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall be deemed given if Lender fails to
respond within ten (10) Business Days after Lender receives all information
reasonably required to adequately review such drawings, plans and
specifications, contracts or work orders. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall
assign any drawings, plans and specifications, contracts or subcontracts to
Lender. Drawings, plans and specifications, contracts and work orders approved
by Lender shall not be changed in any material respect without Lender's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

             (vii) For any Work which requires aggregate payments in amounts
exceeding $500,000, Lender may require an inspection of the Property prior to
making a monthly disbursement from the applicable Work Reserve in order to
verify completion of the work for which disbursement is sought. Lender may
require that such inspection be conducted by an appropriate independent
qualified architect or engineer selected by Lender and/or may require a copy of
a certificate of completion by an independent qualified architect or engineer
based in Nashville, Tennessee and otherwise acceptable to Lender prior to the
disbursement of any amounts from the applicable Work Reserve. Borrower shall pay
the reasonable, out-of-pocket expense of such inspections as required hereunder,
whether such inspections are conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional, up to a maximum of four (4) such inspections during any calendar
year. If Lender should require more than four (4) such inspections during any
calendar year, unless a Default has occurred during such calendar year, the
expense of each additional inspection in any calendar year (over the four
maximum) shall be borne by Lender. Such expenses payable by Borrower may be paid
from the FF&E Reserve.

         (B) PERFORMANCE OF WORK.

             (i) Borrower shall complete all Work in a good and workmanlike
manner as soon as practicable following the commencement thereof. The
insufficiency of the balance in the applicable Work Reserve shall not relieve
Borrower from its obligation to perform and complete the related Work as herein
provided or to fulfill all other preservation and maintenance covenants in the
Loan Documents.

             (ii) In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that any Work is not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that
any Work has not been completed in a workmanlike manner, Lender shall have the
option to withhold disbursement for such unsatisfactory work and so notify
Borrower with reasonable detail regarding the basis for Lender's dissatisfaction
and, after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the giving of such notice by
Lender to Borrower of such unsatisfactory work without the cure thereof (or, if
such unsatisfactory work is susceptible of a cure but cannot reasonably be cured
within said 30-day period and provided that Borrower shall have commenced to
cure such unsatisfactory work within said 30-day period and thereafter
diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, after the expiration of
such longer period as is reasonably necessary for Borrower in the exercise



                                       68
<PAGE>   74

of due diligence to cure such unsatisfactory work, up to a maximum of an
additional sixty (60) days, without the cure thereof), Lender may proceed under
existing contracts or contract with third parties to complete such Work, as the
case may be, and apply amounts contained in the applicable Work Reserve toward
the labor and materials necessary to complete the same, without providing any
additional prior notice to Borrower, and exercise any and all other remedies
available to Lender upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default
hereunder.

             (iii) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making of any
Work pursuant to Section 6.6(B)(ii) above, Borrower grants Lender the right to
enter onto the Property after the expiration of the notice specified above and
perform any and all work and labor necessary to complete the applicable Work
and/or employ watchmen to protect the Property from damage. All sums so expended
by Lender shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and
secured by the Deed of Trust. For this purpose, Borrower constitutes and
appoints Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution to complete or undertake the applicable Work in the name of
Borrower pursuant to Section 6.6(B)(ii) above. Such power of attorney shall be
deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower
empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any funds in the
applicable Work Reserve for the purpose of making or completing any Work; (ii)
to make such additions, changes and corrections to any Work as shall be
reasonably necessary or desirable to complete the same; (iii) to employ such
contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills
and claims which are or may become Liens against the Property, or as may be
necessary or desirable for the completion of any Work, or for clearance of
title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower
which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) in its reasonable
discretion, to prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection
with the Property or the rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to
do any and every act which Borrower might do in its own behalf to fulfill the
terms of this Loan Agreement.

             (iv) Nothing in this Section shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing any Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in addition
to the amounts on deposit in the applicable Work Reserve to make or complete any
Work; (iii) obligate Lender to proceed with any Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Work.

             (v) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect or
inspector) or third parties performing any Work pursuant to this Section 6.6 to
enter onto the Property during normal business hours upon reasonable notice
(subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of
any Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all
plans and shop drawings relating thereto which are or may be kept at the
Property, and to complete any Work made pursuant to Section 6.6(B)(ii). Borrower
shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or
Lender's representatives or such other persons described above in connection
with inspections described in this Section 6.6(B) or the completion of the Work
pursuant to this Section 6.6(B).



                                       69
<PAGE>   75

             (vi) All Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures and any other
item comprising a part thereof shall be constructed, installed or completed, as
applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialman's or other liens
(except for the Permitted Encumbrances).

             (vii) All Work shall comply with all applicable legal requirements
of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Property and
applicable insurance requirements, including, without limitation, applicable
building codes, special use permits, environmental regulations and requirements
of insurance underwriters.

         (C) INDEMNIFICATION. Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender
harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands,
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
arising from or in any way connected with the performance of the Work, except to
the extent caused by the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of
Lender. Borrower shall assign to Lender all rights and claims Borrower may have
against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection with the Work;
provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an
Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

SECTION 6.7 SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit
with Lender (or its Servicer or agent) $1,300,000 (said funds together with any
interest thereon, the "SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE"), which funds shall be held by
Lender in an Eligible Account (the "SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT") in
connection with Borrower's self-insurance program with respect to liability
insurance and worker's compensation as described in Section 5.4. Borrower shall
at all times maintain a balance in the Self-Insurance Reserve Account of not
less than the greater of (a) $1,300,000 and (b) 125% of the aggregate amount of
estimated claims payable during the following twelve (12) months as set forth in
the Insurance Committee Certificate (as defined below) for that month (the
"SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE MINIMUM BALANCE"). On a monthly basis, promptly after
the meeting of Borrower's insurance claims review committee (the "INSURANCE
COMMITTEE"), Borrower shall deliver notice (the "INSURANCE COMMITTEE
CERTIFICATE") in form and substance acceptable to Lender executed by an
independent certified claims adjuster that is a member of the Insurance
Committee setting forth (i) all pending and threatened claims (and known
incidents that may result in a claim) to be covered by Borrower's
self-insurance, and with respect to each such claim: (A) the nature of such
claim and amount thereof (if available), (B) the opinion of the Insurance
Committee as to the likelihood of recovery by the plaintiff thereunder and (C)
the Insurance Committee's estimate of the amount which will be required to be
paid to settle such claim and the estimated date that such claim will be payable
(including the estimated length of time required for settlement or litigation of
such claim) and (ii) the aggregate amount estimated to be payable from
self-insurance during the next twelve (12) months. If, at any time, the balance
in the Self-Insurance Reserve Account shall be less than the Self-Insurance
Reserve Minimum Balance (such deficiency, a "SELF-INSURANCE DEFICIENCY"), such
Self-Insurance Deficiency shall be payable to the Self-Insurance Reserve Account
from funds available in the Central Account pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Cash
Management Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower, in lieu of
self-insuring the liability and worker's compensation coverages described above,
shall hereafter purchase and maintain the insurance policies required for
liability and worker's compensation under Sections 5.4(vii) and (viii),
respectively, which policies shall be with carriers, in amounts and with
deductibles



                                       70
<PAGE>   76

reasonably acceptable to Lender and otherwise comply with the requirements of
Section 5.4, then Borrower shall have no further obligation to maintain the
Self-Insurance Reserve Account or the Self-Insurance Reserve Minimum Balance
under this Section 6.7. In such event, any balance then available in the
Self-Insurance Reserve Account shall be promptly paid to Borrower, provided that
Borrower shall apply such funds to payment of any outstanding claims payable
which were to be covered by Borrower's self-insurance to the extent such funds
are necessary to satisfy same.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                           LOCK BOX, CLEARING ACCOUNT;
                        CENTRAL ACCOUNT; CASH MANAGEMENT

SECTION 7.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCK BOX, CLEARING ACCOUNT AND CENTRAL ACCOUNT.

         (A) (i) LOCK BOX; CLEARING ACCOUNT. On or before the Closing Date,
Borrower shall establish, at Borrower's cost and expense, a lock box (the "LOCK
BOX") and related lock box account which shall be an Eligible Account in the
name of Lender, as secured party hereunder (said account, and any account
replacing same in accordance with this Loan Agreement and the Clearing Account
Agreement, the "CLEARING ACCOUNT") with a financial institution selected or
otherwise approved by Lender (the "CLEARING BANK"), pursuant to an agreement
(the "CLEARING ACCOUNT AGREEMENT") in Lender's form or otherwise in form and
substance acceptable to Lender, executed and delivered by Borrower and the
Clearing Bank. The LockBox and the Clearing Account shall be under the sole
dominion and control of Lender (which dominion and control may be exercised by
Servicer). Among other things, the Clearing Account Agreement shall provide that
Borrower shall have no access to or control over the Lock Box or the Clearing
Account, that all deposits into the Lock Box shall be deposited by the Clearing
Bank into the Clearing Account as received, and that all available funds on
deposit in the Clearing Account shall be deposited by wire transfer (or transfer
via the ACH System) on a daily basis by the Clearing Bank into the Central
Account, for application in accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.
Provided no Event of Default and exercise of remedies has occurred, Borrower
shall be entitled to receive copies of bank statements and other information
made available by the Clearing Bank and the Central Account Bank concerning the
Clearing Account and the Central Account.

             (ii) Upon establishing the Lock Box and Clearing Account, (1)
Borrower shall instruct, by irrevocable written direction, in Lender's form or
otherwise in form and substance acceptable to Lender, each tenant and other
Person from time to time party to any Lease or other agreement pursuant to which
Operating Revenues are payable to Borrower or Manager on a recurring basis
(including without limitation all Persons paying or disbursing credit card
receivables (the "CREDIT CARD COMPANIES")) to pay all Rents and other amounts
owed under such Leases and other agreements directly to the Lock Box, unless
Lender shall otherwise direct in writing, and (2) Borrower shall obtain an
agreement (each, a "CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES PAYMENT DIRECTION LETTER") from each
of the Credit Card Companies, in Lender's form or otherwise in form and
substance acceptable to Lender, pursuant to which the Credit Card Companies
agree to pay all credit card receivables into the Lock Box, and acknowledge and
agree that Lender shall have a first priority perfected security interest in
such credit card receivables. Borrower shall cause any and all other Receipts
(including Rents that are not paid



                                       71
<PAGE>   77

into the Clearing Account in accordance with the foregoing) to be deposited
promptly into the Clearing Account and in no event later than two (2) Business
Days after the same are paid to or for the benefit of Borrower. To the extent
that Borrower or any Person on Borrower's behalf holds any Receipts, whether in
accordance with this Loan Agreement or otherwise, Borrower shall be deemed to
hold the same in trust for Lender for the protection of the interests of Lender
hereunder and under the Loan Documents. Borrower represents and warrants that,
as of the date hereof, the only Credit Card Companies paying or disbursing
credit card receivables with respect to the Property are Discover Financial
Services, Inc., American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. and Chase
Merchant Services, L.L.C. and, in the event that Borrower shall hereafter enter
into an agreement with any other Credit Card Company pursuant to which such
Credit Card Company shall pay credit card receivables with respect to the
Property, Borrower shall promptly obtain a Credit Card Receivables Payment
Direction Letter in form and substance acceptable to Lender from such Credit
Card Company.

             (iii) Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender
in connection with the transactions and other matters contemplated by this
Section 7.1, including but not limited to, Lender's reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses, and all fees and expenses of the Clearing Bank and the Central
Account Bank, including without limitation their attorneys fees and expenses.

         (B) CENTRAL ACCOUNT. On or before the Closing Date, pursuant to the
terms of the Cash Management Agreement, Borrower shall establish and maintain an
Eligible Account in the name of Lender, as secured party hereunder, to serve as
the "Central Account" (said account, and any account replacing the same in
accordance with this Loan Agreement and the Cash Management Agreement, the
"CENTRAL ACCOUNT"; and the depositary institution in which the Central Account
is maintained, the "CENTRAL ACCOUNT BANK"). The Central Account shall be under
the sole dominion and control of Lender (which dominion and control may be
exercised by Servicer); and except as expressly provided hereunder and/or in the
Cash Management Agreement, Borrower shall have no rights to control or direct
the investment or payment of funds therein. Lender may elect to change any
financial institution in which the Central Account shall be maintained. The
Central Account shall be deemed to contain such sub-accounts as Lender may
designate ("SUB-ACCOUNTS"), which may be maintained as separate ledger accounts
and need not be separate Eligible Accounts. The Sub-Accounts shall include the
following as more particularly described in the Cash Management Agreement:

             (i) "DEBT SERVICE SUB-ACCOUNT" shall mean the Sub-Account of the
Central Account established for the purposes of reserving for payments of
principal and interest and other amounts due under the Loan Documents (but
without duplication of amounts covered under item (ii) below); and

             (ii) "RESERVE SUB-ACCOUNTS" shall mean the Sub-Accounts of the
Central Account established for the purpose of holding funds in the Reserves
including: (a) the "Imposition and Insurance Reserve Sub-Account"; (b) the "FF&E
Reserve Sub-Account"; (c) the "Cash Trap Reserve Sub-Account"; and (d) the "Self
Insurance Reserve Deficiency Sub-Account".



                                       72
<PAGE>   78

SECTION 7.2 APPLICATION OF FUNDS IN CENTRAL ACCOUNT. Funds in the Central
Account shall be allocated to the Sub-Accounts (or paid, as the case may be) in
accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.

SECTION 7.3 APPLICATION OF FUNDS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section or elsewhere, Lender shall have all rights and remedies available
under applicable law and under the Loan Documents. Without limitation of the
foregoing, for so long as an Event of Default exists, Lender may apply any and
all funds in the Lock Box, the Clearing Account, the Central Account and/or any
Sub-Accounts against all or any portion of any of the Obligations, in any order.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                          DEFAULT, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES

SECTION 8.1 EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         "EVENT OF DEFAULT" shall mean the occurrence or existence of any one or
more of the following:

         (A) SCHEDULED PAYMENTS. Failure of Borrower to pay any scheduled
payment amount when the same is due under this Loan Agreement, the Note, or any
other Loan Documents (whether such amount is interest, principal, Reserves, or
otherwise); or

         (B) OTHER PAYMENTS. Failure of Borrower to pay any amount from time to

of an involuntary Lien under Section 11.1 or 5.18, the same shall not constitute
an Event of Default if within thirty (30) days after the filing thereof,
Borrower shall either (i) cause the same to be removed of record, or (ii)
provide to Lender security for the same in an amount and pursuant to terms both
satisfactory to Lender in Lender's sole discretion). Except as permitted under
Section 5.5(A) or otherwise expressly permitted hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents, the demolition or removal of any of the Improvements or the
making of any Material Alterations to any of the Improvements, without Lender's

<PAGE>   79

         (F) OTHER DEFAULTS UNDER LOAN DOCUMENTS. A default shall occur in the
performance of or compliance with any term contained in this Loan Agreement or
the other Loan Documents and such default is not fully cured within thirty (30)
days after receipt by Borrower of written notice from Lender of such default
(other than occurrences described in other provisions of this Section 8.1 for
which a different grace or cure period is specified or which constitute
immediate Events of Default); provided however that if (i) the default is
capable of cure but with diligence cannot be cured within such period of thirty
(30) days, (ii) Borrower (or the applicable Borrower Party) has commenced the
cure within such thirty (30) day period and has pursued such cure diligently,
and (iii) Borrower delivers to Lender promptly following written demand (which
demand may be made from time to time by Lender) evidence satisfactory to Lender
of the foregoing, then such period shall be extended for so long as is
reasonably necessary for Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such
default, but in no event beyond the 60th day after the original notice of
default; or

         (G) INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY; APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER, ETC. (i) A court

         (H) VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY; APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER, ETC. (i) An order
for relief is entered with respect to any Borrower Party or Member, or any such
Person commences a voluntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case or to the
conversion of an involuntary case to a voluntary case under any such law or
consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, trustee or
other custodian for any Borrower Party or Member or for all or a substantial
part of the property of any Borrower Party or Member; (ii) any Borrower Party or
Member makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iii) the Board of
Directors or other governing body of any Borrower Party or Member adopts any
resolution or otherwise authorizes action to approve any of the actions referred
to in this subsection 8.1(H); or

         (I) BANKRUPTCY INVOLVING OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OR PROPERTY. Other than as
described in either of Subsections 8.1(G) or 8.1(H), all or any portion of the
Collateral becomes property of the estate or subject to the automatic stay in
any case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect (provided that if the
same occurs in the context of an involuntary proceeding, it shall not constitute
an Event of Default if it is dismissed or discharged within sixty (60) days
following its occurrence); or



                                       74
<PAGE>   80

         (J) SOLVENCY. Any Borrower Party or Member ceases to be solvent or
admits in writing its present or prospective inability to pay its debts as they
become due; or

         (K) JUDGMENT AND ATTACHMENTS. Any lien, money judgment, writ or warrant
of attachment, or similar process is entered or filed against any Borrower Party
or any of its assets,, which claim is not fully covered by insurance (other than
with respect to the amount of commercially reasonable deductibles permitted
hereunder), would have a Material Adverse Effect and remains undischarged,
unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of thirty (30) days; or

         (L) INJUNCTION. Any Borrower Party is enjoined, restrained or in any
way prevented by the order of any court or any administrative or regulatory
agency from conducting all or any material part of its business and such order
continues for more than thirty (30) days; or

         (M) INVALIDITY OF LOAN DOCUMENTS. This Loan Agreement, the Deed of
Trust or any of the Loan Documents for any reason ceases to be in full force and
effect or ceases to be a legally valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Borrower or any Lien securing the Obligations shall, in whole or in part, cease
to be a perfected first priority Lien, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances
(except in any of the foregoing cases in accordance with the terms hereof or
under any other Loan Document), or any Person who is a party thereto, other than
Lender, denies that it has any further liability (as distinguished from denial
of the existence of a Default or Event of Default) under any Loan Documents to
which it is party, or gives notice to such effect; or

         (N) CROSS-DEFAULT WITH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. A default beyond any
applicable grace periods shall occur under any of the other Loan Documents; or

         (O) DEFAULT UNDER MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. Any
breach or default shall occur in the material obligations of Borrower under the
Management Agreement or any Franchise Agreement which may hereafter be entered
into with respect to the Property, and such breach or default either is of such
a nature or continues for such a period of time that Manager or the franchisor,
as applicable, shall have the right to exercise material remedies as a
consequence thereof.

If more than one of the foregoing paragraphs shall describe the same condition
or event, then Lender shall have the right to select which paragraph or
paragraphs shall apply. In any such case, Lender shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to designate the paragraph or paragraphs which provide for
non-written notice (or for no notice) or for a shorter time to cure (or for no
time to cure).

SECTION 8.2 ACCELERATION AND REMEDIES.

         (A) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in any of
Subsections 8.1(G), 8.1(H), or 8.1(I), the unpaid principal amount of and
accrued interest and fees on the Loan and all other Obligations shall
automatically become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or other
requirements of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each
Borrower Party and Member. Upon and at any time after the occurrence of any
other Event of Default, at the option



                                       75
<PAGE>   81

of Lender, which may be exercised without notice or demand to anyone, all or any
portion of the Loan and other Obligations shall immediately become due and
payable.

         (B) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more
of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or at law
or in equity, may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time to time,
whether or not all or any of the Obligations shall be declared due and payable,
and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or
other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the
Loan Documents with respect to the Property. Any such actions taken by Lender
shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly,
successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender
may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender
permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of
Default is continuing (i) to the fullest extent permitted by law, Lender shall
not be subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or rule, and
(ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall
remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies
against the Property and the Deed of Trust has been foreclosed, sold and/or
otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the Obligations or the Obligations
have been paid in full.

         (C) Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially
foreclose the Deed of Trust in any manner and for any amounts secured by the
Deed of Trust then due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole
discretion including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in
the event Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of
one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose
the Deed of Trust to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event
Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance
of the Loan, Lender may foreclose the Deed of Trust to recover so much of the
principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums
secured by the Deed of Trust as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more
partial foreclosures, the Property shall remain subject to the Deed of Trust to
secure payment of sums secured by the Deed of Trust and not previously
recovered.

         (D) Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note and
the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other
security documents in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole
discretion for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies
provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to
time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other
documents as Lender shall request in order to effect the severance described in
the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true
and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and
execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance,
Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof;
provided, however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under
such power until three (3) days after notice has been given to Borrower by
Lender of Lender's intent to exercise its rights under such power.



                                       76
<PAGE>   82

         (E) Any amounts recovered from the Property or any other collateral for
the Loan after an Event of Default may be applied by Lender toward the payment
of any interest and/or principal of the Loan and/or any other amounts due under
the Loan Documents in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole
discretion shall determine.

         (F) The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which
Lender may have against Borrower pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's rights,
powers and remedies may be pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at such
time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No
delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event
of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as
a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver
of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any
remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

SECTION 8.3 PERFORMANCE BY LENDER.

         (A) If any Borrower Party shall fail to perform, or cause to be
performed, any covenant, duty or agreement contained in any of the Loan
Documents (subject to applicable notice and cure periods), Lender may perform or
attempt to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of such Borrower
Party. In such event, Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, promptly pay to
Lender any amount reasonably expended by Lender in such performance or attempted
performance, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate, from the date
of such expenditure until paid. Any amounts advanced or expended by Lender to
perform or attempt to perform any such matter shall be added to and included
within the indebtedness evidenced by the applicable Note and shall be secured by
all of the Collateral securing the applicable Loan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is expressly agreed that Lender shall not have any liability or
responsibility for the performance of any obligation of Borrower under this Loan
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         (B) Lender may cease or suspend any and all performance required of
Lender under the Loan Documents upon and during the continuance of any Default,
and upon and at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default.

SECTION 8.4 EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE. Promptly following request by Lender, each
Borrower Party shall provide such documents and instruments as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Lender to evidence compliance with any provision of
the Loan Documents applicable to such Borrower Party.

for an Independent Director hereunder except that, solely for purposes of
determining the standards for an independent director of Member's Manager under

                                   ARTICLE X
                RESTRUCTURING LOAN, SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS

SECTION 10.1 SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY. Lender shall have the
right to engage in one or more Secondary Market Transactions with respect to the
Loan, and to structure and restructure all or any part of the Loan, including
without limitation in multiple tranches, as a wraparound loan, or for inclusion
in a REMIC or other Securitization. Without limitation, Lender shall have the
right to cause the Note and the Deed of Trust to be split into a first and a
second mortgage loan, or into one or more loans secured by mortgages and by
ownership interests in Borrower in whatever proportion Lender determines, and
thereafter to engage in Secondary Market Transactions with respect to all or any
part of the indebtedness and loan documentation. Each of the Borrower Parties
and Member acknowledge that it is the intention of the parties that all or a
portion of the Loan will be securitized and that all or a portion of the Loan
will be rated by one or more Rating Agencies. Each of the Borrower Parties and
Member further acknowledge that additional structural modifications may be
required to satisfy issues raised by any Rating Agencies. As used herein,
"SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTION" means any of (i) the sale, assignment, or other
transfer of all or any portion of the Obligations or the Loan Documents or any
interest therein to one or more investors, (ii) the sale, assignment, or other
transfer of one or more participation interests in the Obligations or Loan
Documents to one or more investors, (iii) the transfer or deposit of all or any
portion of the Obligations or Loan Documents to or with one or more trusts or
other entities which may sell certificates or other instruments to investors
evidencing an ownership interest in the assets of such trust or the right to
receive income or proceeds therefrom or (iv) any other Securitization backed in
whole or in part by the Loan or any interest therein.

SECTION 10.2 COOPERATION; LIMITATIONS. Borrower Parties and Member shall use all
reasonable efforts and cooperate reasonably and in good faith with Lender in
effecting any such restructuring or Secondary Market Transaction. Such
cooperation shall include without limitation, executing and delivering such
reasonable amendments to the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of
Borrower and Member as Lender or any Interested Party (as defined below) may
request, provided however that, except as provided in the Securitization Side
Letter, no such amendment shall modify (i) the interest rate payable under the
Note; (ii) the stated maturity date of the Note, (iii) the amortization of the
principal amount of the Note, (iv) any other material economic terms of the
Obligations, (v) the non-recourse provisions of the Loan or (vi) any provision,
the effect of which would materially increase Borrower's obligations or



                                       81
<PAGE>   87

materially decrease Borrower's rights under the Loan Documents. Such cooperation
also shall include using best efforts to obtain such certificates and assurances
from governmental entities and others as Lender may request. Borrower Parties
shall not be required to provide additional collateral that was not initially
contemplated by the parties to effect any such restructuring or Secondary Market
Transaction after the Closing Date. Borrower shall be required to pay on the
date of closing of any Secondary Market Transaction involving the Loan (the
"SECONDARY MARKET CLOSING DATE") the fees charged by each of the Rating Agencies
for the issuance of the ratings assigned to the Securities issued in connection
with such Secondary Market Transaction and thereafter Borrower shall be required
to pay any and all fees of the Rating Agencies for maintaining and/or monitoring
such ratings during the terms of the Loan. Borrower Parties shall not be
required to pay any third party costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
connection with any such Secondary Market Transaction unless otherwise payable
by the Borrower Parties under this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 10.3 INFORMATION. Borrower Parties and Member, at their sole cost and
expense, shall provide such access to personnel and such information and
documents relating to Borrower Parties, Member, Manager, the Property and
Collateral and the business and operations of all of the foregoing and such
opinions of counsel (including nonconsolidation opinions) as any Rating Agency
may request or as Lender or any other Interested Party (as defined below) may
reasonably request (and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender
and each Interested Party) in connection with any such Secondary Market
Transaction including, without limitation, updated financial information,
appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews (Phase I's and, if
appropriate, Phase II's), property condition reports and other due diligence
investigations together with appropriate verification of such updated
information and reports through letters of auditors and consultants and, as of
the closing date of the Secondary Market Transaction, updated representations
and warranties made in the Loan Documents and such additional representations
and warranties as any Rating Agency may request or any purchaser, transferee,
assignee, trustee, servicer or potential investor (the Rating Agencies and all
of the foregoing parties, collectively, "INTERESTED PARTIES") may reasonably
request. Prior to the issuance of any preliminary offering memorandum with
respect to any Secondary Market Transaction, Borrower, at its sole cost and
expense, shall cause Sherrard & Roe, PLC or other counsel for Borrower
reasonably satisfactory to Lender, to deliver to Lender a form of an opinion of
counsel to the effect that the description of the Loan, the terms of the Loan
Documents and description of the Property contained in the Disclosure Documents
(hereinafter defined) and such other legal matters contained therein as Lender
may reasonably require do not contain any untrue statement of any material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (such opinion, a "10B-5 OPINION") and on or prior to the date of
closing of any Secondary Market Transaction, Borrower, at its sole cost and
expense, shall cause Sherrard & Roe, PLC or such other counsel to execute and
deliver such 10b-5 Opinion and, if required by any Rating Agency or reasonably
required by Lender, provide revisions or "bringdowns" to any opinions delivered
at Closing (including nonconsolidation opinions), or if required new versions of
such opinions, addressed to Lender, any trustee under any Securitization backed
in whole or in part by the Loan, any Rating Agency that assigns a rating to any
securities in connection therewith and any investor purchasing securities
therein. Lender shall be permitted to share all such information with the
investment banking firms, Rating Agencies, accounting firms, law firms, other
third party advisory firms, potential investors, servicers and other service
providers and other parties involved in any proposed Secondary



                                       82
<PAGE>   88

Market Transaction. Borrower understands that any such information may be
incorporated into any offering circular, prospectus, prospectus supplement,
private placement memorandum or other offering documents for any Secondary
Market Transaction. Lender and all of the aforesaid third-party advisors and
professional firms and investors shall be entitled to rely upon such
information. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower and Guarantor shall each
provide in connection with each of (i) a preliminary and a final private
placement memorandum or (ii) a preliminary and final prospectus or prospectus
supplement, as applicable (the documents referred to in the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii), collectively, the "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS"), an agreement certifying
that Borrower and Guarantor have examined such Disclosure Documents specified by
Lender and that each such Disclosure Document, as it relates to Borrower,
Guarantor, any Affiliates, the Property, Manager and all other aspects of the
Loan, does not, and as to information provided in third party reports of
engineers and environmental consultants, to Borrower's and Guarantor's
knowledge, does not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Borrower
and Guarantor shall each execute and deliver to Lender on or before the date of
closing of any Secondary Market Transaction an indemnity agreement in form and
substance acceptable to Lender, pursuant to which they shall agree to indemnify,
defend, protect and hold harmless Lender, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated ("MERRILL LYNCH"), First Union National Bank, Prudential Mortgage
Capital Company, LLC and their respective Affiliates, directors, employees,
agents and each Person, if any, who controls Lender, Merrill Lynch or any such
Affiliate within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 or
Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and any other placement agent
or underwriter with respect to any Securitization or Secondary Market
Transaction from and against any losses, claims, damages and liabilities that
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of any material fact contained in any information or documents furnished by
Borrower, Guarantor or their Affiliates or representative or in any
representation or warranty of any Borrower Party contained herein or in the
other Loan Documents or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in such
information or necessary in order to make the statements in such information not
materially misleading. Lender may publicize the existence of the Obligations in
connection with Lender's Secondary Market Transaction activities or otherwise.

SECTION 10.4 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. In any Secondary Market Transaction, Lender
may transfer its obligations under this Loan Agreement and under the other Loan
Documents (or may transfer the portion thereof corresponding to the transferred
portion of the Obligations), and thereafter Lender shall be relieved of any
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents arising after the date
of said transfer with respect to the transferred interest. Each transferee
investor shall become a "Lender" hereunder.

SECTION 10.5 FORMATION OF DEPOSITOR. Prior to the Secondary Market Closing Date,
Borrower, at its sole cost and expense, will form or cause to be formed a
corporation, single member limited liability company or other special purpose
entity (the "DEPOSITOR"), the sole purpose of which will be to act as the
"depositor" of the trust to be formed in connection with any Secondary Market
Transaction with respect to the Loan. The Depositor will be a direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Guarantor and will, at all times, comply with all of
the terms and conditions of Article IX of this Loan Agreement other than the
requirement to



                                       83
<PAGE>   89

maintain two Independent Directors on its board of directors (or the board of
directors of a member or independent manager of the Depositor, as the case may
be). Borrower will at all times during the term of the Loan preserve and keep in
full force and effect the legal existence of the Depositor, including its
qualification to do business in each state where it is required by law to so
qualify. On or before the Secondary Market Closing Date, Borrower will cause
Sherrard & Roe, PLC or other legal counsel for the Depositor acceptable to
Lender to deliver legal opinions for the Depositor in form and substance
acceptable to Lender and the Interested Parties as to such matters as Lender or
any Interested Party shall reasonably request, including, without limitation,
opinions with respect to organizational formalities, due authority, execution
and delivery by the Depositor, and enforceability against the Depositor, of all
documents to which it is a party and a bankruptcy non-consolidation opinion with
respect to the Depositor.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                 RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS, TRANSFERS; ASSUMABILITY

SECTION 11.1 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND ENCUMBRANCE. Except for a Transfer and
Assumption in accordance with Section 11.3 or as otherwise expressly permitted
under this Article XI, Borrower shall not cause or suffer to occur or exist,
directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or
otherwise, any sale, transfer, mortgage, pledge, Lien or encumbrance (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) of (i) all or any part of the Property or any interest
therein, or (ii) any direct or indirect ownership or beneficial interest in
Borrower, irrespective of the number of tiers of ownership. Nothing contained in
this Section 11.1 shall be deemed to prohibit Borrower from (a) entering into
Leases in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.12 or (b) selling or
disposing of FF&E which is being replaced in the ordinary course of business
provided that such sale or transfer would not have a material adverse effect on
the value of the Property and provided further that any new FF&E acquired by
Borrower shall be subject to the Lien of the Deed of Trust.

SECTION 11.2 TRANSFERS OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN BORROWER. For purposes of this
Section, a sale or transfer of a beneficial interest in Borrower shall be deemed
to include, but is not limited to the following ("PROHIBITED OWNERSHIP INTEREST
TRANSFERS"):

         (A) if Borrower or any general partner or managing member of Borrower
is a corporation, (i) the voluntary or involuntary sale, conveyance, transfer or
pledge (any of the foregoing, a "TRANSFER") of a majority of such corporation's
stock (or the stock of any corporation directly or indirectly controlling such
corporation by operation of law or otherwise) or (ii) the creation or issuance
of new stock, in any of the foregoing cases, by which an aggregate of more than
49% of such corporation's stock shall be vested in a party or parties who are
not now stockholders or which results in a change of control of such
corporation;

         (B) if Borrower or any general partner or managing member (or, for a
single member limited liability company, the sole member) of Borrower is a
limited liability company, (i) the change, removal or resignation of a managing
member (or sole member) of Borrower or such general partner or managing member
(or sole member) or (ii) the Transfer of all or any portion of the membership
interests of a managing member (or sole member) of Borrower or such general
partner or managing member or any profits or proceeds relating to such
membership interest; provided, however, that if Borrower or any general partner

in the aggregate of not more than 49% of the sole member's interest in Borrower
or such general partner or managing member (or sole member), or any profits or
proceeds relating to such member's interest, shall not constitute a sale or
transfer prohibited by this Section 11 provided that such Transfer does not in
the aggregate result in a change of control of Borrower or such general partner
or managing member (or sole member);

transfer is satisfactory to Lender and in accordance with the standards of the
Rating Agencies.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                 WAIVERS OF DEFENSES OF GUARANTORS AND SURETIES

SECTION 13.1 WAIVERS. To the extent that any Borrower Party (in this Article, a
"WAIVING PARTY") is deemed for any reason to be a guarantor or surety of or for
any other Borrower Party



                                       88
<PAGE>   94

or Affiliate or to have rights or obligations in the nature of the rights or
obligations of a guarantor or surety (whether by reason of execution of a
guaranty, provision of security for the obligations of another, or otherwise)
then this Article shall apply. This Article shall not affect the rights of the
Waiving Party other than to waive or limit rights and defenses that Waiving
Party would have (i) in its capacity as a guarantor or surety or (ii) in its
capacity as one having rights or obligations in the nature of a guarantor or
surety. Waiving Party, in the broadest and most comprehensive sense, hereby
waives any and all claims, rights, or defenses that may be asserted by a
guarantor or surety against a creditor. Without limitation of the foregoing:

             Waiving Party hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of receivership or
bankruptcy of any of the other Borrower Parties, protest or notice with respect
to any of the obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties, setoffs and
counterclaims and all presentments, demands for performance, notices of
nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of
acceptance, the benefits of all statutes of limitation, and all other demands
whatsoever (and shall not require that the same be made on any of the other
Borrower Parties as a condition precedent to the obligations of Waiving Party),
and covenants that the Loan Documents will not be discharged, except by complete
payment and performance of the obligations evidenced and secured thereby, except
only as limited by the express contractual provisions of the Loan Documents.
Waiving Party further waives all notices that the principal amount, or any
portion thereof, and/or any interest on any instrument or document evidencing
all or any part of the obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties to
Lender is due, notices of any and all proceedings to collect from any of the
other Borrower Parties or any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part
of their obligations, or from any other person or entity, and, to the extent
permitted by law, notices of exchange, sale, surrender or other handling of any
security or collateral given to Lender to secure payment of all or any part of
the obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties.

             Except only to the extent provided otherwise in the express
contractual provisions of the Loan Documents, Waiving Party hereby agrees that
all of its obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and
effect, without defense, offset or counterclaim of any kind, notwithstanding
that any right of Waiving Party against any of the other Borrower Parties or
defense of Waiving Party against Lender may be impaired, destroyed, or otherwise
affected by reason of any action or inaction on the part of Lender. Waiving
Party waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by
the Lender, even though that election of remedies, may have destroyed the
Waiving Party's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the other
Borrower Parties.

             Lender is hereby authorized, without notice or demand, from time to
time, (a) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment
of, or other terms relating to, all or any part of the obligations of any of the
other Borrower Parties; (b) to accept partial payments on all or any part of the
obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties; (c) to take and hold security
or collateral for the payment of all or any part of the obligations of any of
the other Borrower Parties; (d) to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such
security or collateral for such obligations; (e) to apply such security or
collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in its discretion
it may determine; (f) to settle, release, exchange, enforce, waive, compromise
or collect or otherwise liquidate all or any part of such obligations and any
security or collateral for such obligations. Any of the foregoing may be done in
any



                                       89
<PAGE>   95

manner, and Waiving Party agrees that the same shall not affect or impair the
obligations of Waiving Party under the Loan Documents.

             Waiving Party hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself
informed of the financial condition of all of the other Borrower Parties and any
and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of all or any part of the obligations
of the other Borrower Parties, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the
risk of nonpayment of such obligations, and Waiving Party hereby agrees that
Lender shall have no duty to advise Waiving Party of information known to it
regarding such condition or any such circumstances.

             Waiving Party agrees that neither Lender nor any person or entity
acting for or on behalf of Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any
assets in favor of Waiving Party or against or in payment of any or all of the
obligations secured hereby. Waiving Party further agrees that, to the extent
that any of the other Borrower Parties or any other guarantor of all or any part
of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties makes a payment or payments to
Lender, or Lender receives any proceeds of collateral for any of the obligations
of the other Borrower Parties, which payment or payments or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid or refunded, then, to the extent of such payment or
repayment, the part of such obligations which has been paid, reduced or
satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and
effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment, reduction or
satisfaction.

             Waiving Party (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect
to the obligations of the other Borrower Parties; (ii) waives any right to
enforce any remedy that Lender now has or may hereafter have against any of the
other Borrower Parties any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of such
obligations or any other person; and (iii) waives any benefit of, and any right
to participate in, any security or collateral given to Lender to secure the
payment or performance of all or any part of such obligations or any other
liability of the other parties to Lender.

             Waiving Party agrees that any and all claims that it may have
against any of the other Borrower Parties, any endorser or any other guarantor
of all or any part of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties, or against
any of their respective properties, shall be subordinate and subject in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all obligations secured hereby.
Notwithstanding any right of any of the Waiving Party to ask, demand, sue for,
take or receive any payment from the other Borrower Parties, all rights, liens
and security interests of Waiving Party, whether now or hereafter arising and
howsoever existing, in any assets of any of the other Borrower Parties (whether
constituting part of the security or collateral given to Lender to secure
payment of all or any part of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties or
otherwise) shall be and hereby are subordinated to the rights of Lender in those
assets.

set off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee,

common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such recovery, the
Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens,
if any, and rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set
off had not occurred.

SECTION 14.9 SEVERABILITY. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction of any provision in or obligation under this Loan Agreement, the
Note or other Loan Documents shall not affect or impair the validity, legality

SECTION 14.10 HEADINGS. Section and subsection headings in this Loan Agreement
are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Loan Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive
effect.

SECTION 14.11 APPLICABLE LAW. THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
WERE NEGOTIATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND EXECUTED AND DELIVERED IN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, AND THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOAN WERE DISBURSED FROM NEW YORK,
WHICH STATE THE PARTIES AGREE HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE PARTIES AND
TO THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION EMBODIED HEREBY, AND IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION,
VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE. THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND



                                       94
<PAGE>   100

THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND
ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EXCEPT THAT AT ALL TIMES THE
PROVISIONS FOR THE CREATION, PERFECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE LIENS AND
SECURITY INTERESTS CREATED PURSUANT TO THE DEED OF TRUST AND THE ASSIGNMENT OF
LEASES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED,
EXCEPT THAT THE SECURITY INTERESTS IN ACCOUNT COLLATERAL SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR THE STATE WHERE THE SAME IS HELD, AT THE
OPTION OF LENDER.

SECTION 14.12 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Loan Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns except that no Borrower Party may assign its rights or obligations
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly provided
in Article XI.

SECTION 14.13 SOPHISTICATED PARTIES, REASONABLE TERMS, NO FIDUCIARY
RELATIONSHIP. Borrower Parties represent, warrant and acknowledge that (i) they
are sophisticated real estate investors, familiar with transactions of this
kind, and (ii) they have entered into this Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents after conducting their own assessment of the alternatives available to
them in the market, and after lengthy negotiations in which they have been
represented by legal counsel of their choice. Borrower Parties also acknowledge
and agree that the rights of Lender under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents are reasonable and appropriate, taking into consideration all of the
facts and circumstances including without limitation the quantity of the Loan,
the nature of the Property, and the risks incurred by Lender in this
transaction. No provision in this Loan Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents and no course of dealing between the parties shall be deemed to create
(i) any partnership or joint venture between Lender and Borrower or any other
Person, or (ii) any fiduciary or similar duty by Lender to Borrower or any other
Person. The relationship between Lender and Borrower is exclusively the
relationship of a creditor and a debtor, and all relationships between Lender
and any other Borrower Party are ancillary to such creditor/debtor relationship.

SECTION 14.14 REASONABLENESS OF DETERMINATIONS. In any instance where any
consent, approval, determination or other action by Lender is, pursuant to the
Loan Documents or applicable law, required to be done reasonably or required not
to be unreasonably withheld, then Lender's action shall be presumed to be
reasonable, and Borrower shall bear the burden of proof of showing that the same
was not reasonable. In all cases Lender shall conclusively be deemed to be
acting reasonably when implementing any standard or requirement of any
applicable Rating Agency. In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that
Lender or its agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in
any case where, by law or under this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
Lender or such agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or
promptly, neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any monetary
damages, and Borrower's sole remedy shall be limited to commencing an action
seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. Any action or proceeding to
determine



                                       95
<PAGE>   101

whether Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking
declaratory judgment.

SECTION 14.15 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Neither Lender, nor any Affiliate,
officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent of Lender, shall have any
liability with respect to, and each of the Borrower Parties and Member hereby
waives, releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any
special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages suffered or incurred by
the Borrower Parties or Member in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to, this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender. Each
of the Borrower Parties and Member hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to
sue Lender or any of Lender's Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
attorneys, or agents for punitive damages in respect of any claim in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Loan Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Loan
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
the same is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender.

SECTION 14.16 NO DUTY. All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, and other
professional Persons and consultants retained by Lender shall have the right to
act exclusively in the interest of Lender and shall have no duty of disclosure,
duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or obligation of any type or nature
whatsoever to any Borrower Party or Affiliates thereof, or any other Person.

Loan Documents referred to herein embody the final, entire agreement among the
parties hereto and supersede any and all prior commitments, agreements,
representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the

parties hereto. There are no oral agreements among the parties to the Loan
Documents.

Lender acknowledge that each of them has had the benefit of legal counsel of its
own choice and has been afforded an opportunity to review this Loan Agreement
and the other Loan Documents with its legal counsel and that this Loan Agreement
and the other Loan Documents shall be construed as if jointly drafted by

                    NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT (this
"AGREEMENT") is entered into by and among ______________________________, a
___________________________ ("TENANT"), whose address is
_____________________________, ______________________________, a
___________________________ ("LANDLORD"), whose address is
___________________________, and
_______________________________________________, its successors and/or assigns
("LENDER"), whose address is _____________________________________.


                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, Landlord is the owner in fee simple of the real property
described in Exhibit A attached hereto, together with the improvements thereon
(the "PROPERTY");

         WHEREAS, Landlord or its predecessor and Tenant have entered into a
certain lease, dated _________________ [and amended/modified/extended/renewed by
____________________________, dated _______________] (as the same may hereafter
be amended, modified, renewed, extended or replaced, the "LEASE"), leasing to
Tenant a portion of the Property (the "PREMISES");

         WHEREAS, Lender has agreed to make a certain mortgage loan to Landlord
(the "LOAN"), which will be evidenced by Landlord's Promissory Note in such
amount (the "NOTE") and secured by, among other things, a certain Mortgage [Deed
of Trust], Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (as the
same may hereafter be amended, modified, extended or recast, the "MORTGAGE") and
a certain Assignment of Leases and Rents (the "ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES")
encumbering the Property, which Mortgage and Assignment of Leases are to be
recorded simultaneously herewith;

         WHEREAS, Lender, Landlord and Tenant desire to confirm their
understanding with respect to the Lease and the Loan and the rights of Tenant
and Lender thereunder.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

         1. Subordination. The Lease, including all of the terms thereof, is and
shall be subject and subordinate to the lien and all of the terms of the
Mortgage to the full extent of all amounts secured by the Mortgage and interest
thereon.


                                   Exhibit B

<PAGE>   111

         2. Attornment. Tenant agrees that it will attorn to and recognize any
purchaser of the Property at a Mortgage foreclosure sale or any transferee who
acquires the Property by deed in lieu of foreclosure or exercise of a power of
sale or otherwise in respect of the Mortgage (in any such case, the "NEW OWNER")
and the successors and assigns of such purchaser or transferee, as its landlord
for the unexpired balance (and any extensions or renewals, if exercised) of the
term of said Lease upon the same terms and conditions set forth in said Lease.

         3. Non-Disturbance. Provided there is no default under the Lease which
continues beyond the expiration of any applicable notice and grace period, such
New Owner will not terminate the Lease or disturb Tenant's possession of the
Premises under the Lease or the right to quiet enjoyment thereof, but the Lease
shall continue in accordance with its terms as a direct lease between Tenant and
New Owner.

         4. Cure by Lender of Landlord Defaults. Tenant agrees to give Lender or
any other New Owner (in accordance with Paragraph 8 hereof) a copy of any notice
of default served upon Landlord which with the passage of time or otherwise
would entitle Tenant to cancel the Lease or abate the rent under the Lease,
provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in writing of the
address of the New Owner, or its agent, servicer or designee. Tenant further
agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time
provided for in the Lease, then Lender have an additional ten (10) days with
respect to a monetary default and thirty (30) days with respect to a
non-monetary default after its receipt of notice within which to cure such
default or if such non-monetary default cannot be cured within that time, then
such additional time as may be necessary to cure such default shall be granted
if within such thirty (30) days Lender has commenced and is diligently pursuing
the remedies necessary to cure such default (including, but not limited to,
commencement of foreclosure proceedings necessary to effect such cure), in which
event the Lease shall not be terminated while such remedies are being so
diligently pursued.

         5. Payments to Lender and Exculpation of Tenant. Tenant is hereby
notified that the Lease and the rent and all other sums due thereunder have been
assigned to Lender as security for the Loan. In the event that Lender notifies
Tenant of a default under the Mortgage and directs that Tenant pay its rent and
all other sums due under the Lease to Lender, Tenant shall honor such direction
without inquiry and pay its rent and all other sums due under the Lease in
accordance with such notice. Landlord agrees that Tenant shall have the right to
rely on any such notice from Lender without incurring any obligation or
liability to Landlord as if such notice were given at the direction of Landlord.
Tenant is hereby instructed to disregard any notice to the contrary received
from or at the behest of Landlord.

         6. Limitation of Liability. If the New Owner acquires the interest of
Landlord under the Lease, the New Owner shall not be:

         (a) liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including
Landlord);

         (b) subject to any claims, offsets, defenses or counterclaims which
Tenant might have against any prior landlord (including Landlord) arising prior
to the date upon which the New Owner shall succeed to the interests of Landlord
under the Lease;


                                   Exhibit B

<PAGE>   112

         (c) bound by any rent or additional rent which Tenant shall have paid
more than one (1) month in advance to any prior landlord (including Landlord)
unless received by New Owner;

         (d) liable for the return of any security deposit not actually received
by New Owner;

         (e) bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without

Loan Documents.

             (d) Until the satisfaction in full of the Senior Loan, Mezzanine
Lender hereby covenants and agrees that it will not acquiesce, petition or
otherwise invoke or cause any other Person to invoke an Insolvency Proceeding

to the date that all obligations of Borrower to Senior Lender with respect to
the Senior Note under the Senior Loan Documents which are then due and owing are

Mezzanine Lender contrary to the provisions of this Agreement shall be received

applied (in the case of cash) to, or held as collateral (in the case of non-cash
property or securities) for, the payment or performance of the Senior Loan in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Loan Documents.

Event of Default under the Senior Loan Documents or Cash Trap Event (as defined

originally scheduled maturity date of the Senior Loan has not occurred,
Mezzanine Lender may accept (x) current payments due and payable from time to
time which Mezzanine Borrower is obligated to pay Mezzanine Lender in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Mezzanine Note and the Mezzanine Loan
Agreement, (y) payments received by Mezzanine Lender in connection with its
exercise of rights and remedies with respect to the Separate Collateral, and (z)
prepayments of the Mezzanine Loan, together with any prepayment fee payable

<PAGE>   127

(calculated based upon Pro Forma Net Operating Income (as such term is defined
in the Senior Loan Agreement) for the Premises for the 12 month period ended
immediately prior to such refinancing and projected debt service on the Senior
Loan and the New Mezzanine Loan for the 12 months following such refinancing
with debt service on the Senior Loan calculated at an interest rate equal to the
sum of the Cap Threshold Rate (as such term is defined in the Senior Loan
Agreement) plus the then Applicable Spread (as such term is defined in the
Senior Loan Agreement) and including required principal amortization payments
under the Senior Loan Documents and debt service under the New Mezzanine Loan
calculated in the same manner (giving effect to any interest rate cap maintained
with respect to the New Mezzanine Loan)) of at least 1.15:1.00; (3) the maturity
date of the New Mezzanine Loan shall be on or after the Maturity Date of the
Senior Loan; (4) the New Mezzanine Loan documents shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Senior Lender; (5) the Mezzanine Lender shall have
delivered a Rating Confirmation Letter from each of the Rating Agencies; (6) the

Lender shall provide Senior Lender with copies of any and all material notices,

Enforcement Action (it being understood, however, that Mezzanine Lender's
failure in good faith so to do shall not diminish Mezzanine Lender's rights
hereunder).

         7. RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION.

             (a) Mezzanine Lender hereby waives any requirement that Senior
Lender marshal any assets in connection with any foreclosure of any security
interest or any other realization upon collateral in respect of the Senior Loan
Documents, or that Senior Lender exhaust its remedies against any portion of the
Premises or collateral under the Senior Loan Documents. Each of Mezzanine Lender
or Senior Lender assumes all responsibility for keeping itself informed as to
the condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower, the condition of the
Premises and all other collateral and other circumstances and, except for
notices expressly required by this Agreement, neither Senior Lender nor
Mezzanine Lender shall have any duty whatsoever to obtain, advise or deliver
information or documents to the other relative to such condition, business,
assets and/or operations. Mezzanine Lender agrees that Senior Lender owes no
fiduciary duty to Mezzanine Lender in connection with the administration of the
Senior Loan and the Senior Loan Documents and Mezzanine Lender agrees never to
assert any such claim. Senior Lender agrees that Mezzanine Lender owes no
fiduciary duty to Senior Lender in connection with the administration of the

<PAGE>   128

             (b) Provided that any of Mezzanine Lender's rights of subrogation
against the Borrower, the Premises or any other collateral under the Senior Loan
Documents be fully subordinate in all respects to all rights of the Senior
Lender and not be exercisable until the indefeasible payment in full of all the
amounts due and owing to Senior Lender under the Senior Loan Documents,
Mezzanine Lender shall be subrogated to the rights of Senior Lender to recover
from Borrower, the Premises or any other collateral, all payments, distributions
and protective advances made to Senior Lender pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement by Mezzanine Lender, together with interest thereon at the applicable
default rate under the Mezzanine Loan Documents.

         8. RIGHTS OF CURE.

             (a) Prior to Senior Lender commencing any Enforcement Action by
reason of a default under the Senior Loan Documents, Senior Lender shall provide
written notice of such default to Mezzanine Lender whether or not Senior Lender
is obligated to give notice thereof to Borrower (each, a "Senior Loan Default
Notice") and shall permit Mezzanine Lender an opportunity to cure such default
upon the following terms. If the default is a monetary default relating to a
liquidated sum of money, Mezzanine Lender shall have two (2) business days after
the giving of the Senior Loan Default Notice with respect to a regular monthly
debt service payment and the later of the applicable cure period under the
Senior Loan Documents and five (5) business days with respect to other monetary
obligations under the Senior Loan Documents (which Senior Loan Default Notice
shall be given concurrently with the notice to Borrower under the Senior Loan
Documents) in which to fully cure such monetary default. If the default is of a
non-monetary nature (other than defaults defined in clauses (G), (H) and (I) of
Section 8.1 of the Senior Loan Agreement), Mezzanine Lender shall be given the
Senior Loan Default Notice concurrently with the notice to Borrower under the
Senior Loan Documents and a cure period of thirty (30) days (or in the case of a
Non-Susceptible Default, the longer of sixty (60) days and written notice of the
commencement of an Enforcement Action by Senior Lender) beyond such cure period
provided to Borrower under the Senior Loan Documents in which to fully cure such
non-monetary default provided in each case, Mezzanine Lender is proceeding with
due diligence to cure such default, and such default does not materially
adversely affect the value of the Premises or Senior Lender's interest therein
or the ability of the Senior Lender to enforce its rights and remedies under the
Senior Loan Documents. If Mezzanine Lender cures a default after the giving of
the Senior Loan Default Notice, any default interest which might otherwise be
due will be reduced to the lesser of (x) default interest as provided under the
Senior Loan Documents and (y) the costs and fees, including interest on
advances, due to, or incurred by, the servicer, special servicer, trustee or
fiscal agent of the Senior Loan. If the default is a maturity date payment
default under the Senior Loan, the Mezzanine Lender shall have a one time right,
within five (5) business days of the maturity date of the Senior Loan to extend
the term for 30 days by making a Monthly Debt Service Payment for such 30 day
period. If the Borrower or Mezzanine Lender does not make the maturity date
payment within such 30 day extension period the Mezzanine Lender shall have the
right to purchase the Senior Loan pursuant to the terms of Section 10 herein.

             (b) To the extent that Mezzanine Lender or any Institutional
Lender/Owner, in accordance with the provisions and conditions of this
Agreement, acquires the ownership interests in Borrower pursuant to a Separate
Collateral Enforcement Action, Mezzanine Lender



                                      C-15
<PAGE>   129

or such Institutional Lender/Owner shall acquire the same subject to the Senior
Loan and the terms, conditions and provisions of the Senior Loan Documents for
the balance of the term thereof, which shall not be accelerated by Senior Lender
solely due to such acquisition; provided, however, that (A) Mezzanine Lender or
such Institutional Lender/Owner shall prior to such acquisition, have agreed in
writing, subject to such exculpatory provisions as shall be set forth in the
Senior Loan Documents, thereafter to perform, or cause to be performed, all of
the terms, conditions and provisions of the Senior Loan Documents on Borrower's
part to be performed, it being understood and agreed, however, that if Mezzanine
Lender or any Institutional Lender/Owner shall succeed to the ownership
interests in Borrower pursuant to a Separate Collateral Enforcement Action,
Senior Lender shall not demand the immediate payment of any amounts due and
payable to Senior Lender which are secured by the Senior Loan Documents if such
right of Senior Lender to demand immediate payment of said amounts is due to a
violation of any "due on sale", change in management or similar provision
contained in the Senior Loan Documents caused solely by Mezzanine Lender or such
Institutional Lender/Owner succeeding to the ownership interests in Borrower
pursuant to a Separate Collateral Enforcement Action in accordance with the
terms hereof, (B) prior to such acquisition, Senior Lender has received a Rating
Confirmation Letter with respect to the exercise of remedies and the acquisition
of the ownership interest in the Borrower by Mezzanine Lender or any
Institutional Lender/Owner, (C) prior to such acquisition, Senior Lender has
received an acceptable substantive nonconsolidation opinion with respect to the
Borrower and the acquired ownership interests therein based on the current
rating agency standards and (D) prior to such acquisition, Senior Lender has
received a management agreement, substantially in the form of the existing
management agreement or otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Senior Lender, between Mezzanine Lender or such Institutional Lender/Owner
and an Approved Manager (as hereinafter defined) or such other property manager
approved pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof. Notwithstanding any contrary or
inconsistent provision of this Agreement, the Senior Loan Documents or the
Mezzanine Loan Documents, no assumption, acquisition or other fee or similar
charge shall be due in connection with Mezzanine Lender's or such other
Institutional Lender/Owner's acquisition of any interest in Borrower or the
Premises as the result of a Separate Collateral Enforcement Action or assignment
in lieu of foreclosure or other negotiated settlement in lieu of any of the
foregoing.

             (c) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing under the Senior Loan Documents which has not been cured by Mezzanine
Lender pursuant to this Agreement, all funds held and applied pursuant to Senior
Lender's Lockbox Agreement, shall continue to be applied pursuant thereto.

         9. NO ACTIONS; RESTRICTIVE PROVISIONS.

             (a) So long as either the Senior Loan or Mezzanine Loan is
outstanding and either the Senior Loan Documents or Mezzanine Loan Documents are
in force and effect, neither Mezzanine Lender nor Senior Lender will take any
action which would effect the termination or modification of any management
agreement now or hereafter affecting or pertaining to the Premises other than in
connection with an Enforcement Action against the Borrower, property manager or
the Premises. Unless the Senior Lender is exercising its rights under the Senior
Loan Documents to cause the Borrower to replace the property manager, Mezzanine
Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any event of default or any other event
which gives the Mezzanine



                                      C-16

Lender the right to terminate the property manager under the Mezzanine Loan
Documents, be entitled to designate a replacement property manager for the
Premises who has sufficient experience in managing properties similar to the
Premises. Senior Lender hereby approves the property managers listed on Schedule
1 attached hereto, as acceptable replacement property managers (each, an
"APPROVED MANAGER"). If the property manager designated by the Mezzanine Lender
is not an Approved Manager, the replacement property manager shall be subject to
the Senior Lender's prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and receipt of a Rating Confirmation Letter with respect to the
replacement property manager.

             (b) Senior Lender shall not (i) designate, replace or change the
servicer or depository bank as provided under the Senior Loan Documents without
prior written notice to Mezzanine Lender, (ii) modify any insurance coverage
affecting the Premises without prior written notice to Mezzanine Lender provided
that Senior Lender shall not modify the insurance requirements set forth in the
Senior Loan Documents regarding the amounts and types of coverage or the credit
ratings of the insurers without Mezzanine Lender's prior written consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (iii) execute any easement, REA or right
of way affecting the Premises that would have a material adverse affect on the
value of the Premises if the consent of Senior Lender is required pursuant to
the Senior Loan Agreement without first obtaining the prior written consent of
Mezzanine Lender not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

             (c) Senior Lender promptly shall notify Mezzanine Lender if
Borrower seeks or requests a release of the liens securing the Senior Loan or
seeks or requests Senior Lender's consent to, or take any action in connection
with or in furtherance of, a Transfer of the Premises or a mortgage refinancing
of the Senior Loan. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred which has
resulted in the commencement of an Enforcement Action under the Senior Loan,
Senior Lender shall not consent to a Transfer of or further encumbrance on the
Premises or any portion thereof without the prior written consent of the
Mezzanine Lender (to the extent Senior Lender has consent rights under the
Senior Loan Documents) unless such Transfer or encumbrance is expressly
permitted under the Senior Loan Documents and the proceeds of such Transfer or
encumbrance repay the Mezzanine Loan in full. Within ninety (90) days of the
scheduled maturity date of the Senior Loan, to the extent Senior Lender has
consent rights under the Senior Loan Documents, the Senior Lender will not be
required to obtain the consent of the Mezzanine Lender in connection with the
sale of the Premises for its "fair market value" as determined by Senior Lender
in good faith; provided, further, however that in connection with the sale of
the Premises for its "fair market value" the Senior Lender will cause, to the
extent it has such rights under the Senior Loan Documents, all amounts in excess
of amounts due on the Senior Loan to be applied toward amounts outstanding under
the Mezzanine Loan. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Mezzanine Loan
Documents to the contrary, Mezzanine Lender, to the extent Mezzanine Lender has
consent rights under the Mezzanine Loan Documents, will consent to a refinancing
(the "TAKE OUT LOAN") of the Senior Loan if (i) the proceeds of the Take Out
Loan does not exceed the balance of the Senior Loan on the refinancing date plus
reasonable closing costs of the Take Out Loan, (ii) either (a) the monthly
principal payment is not greater than the monthly principal due under the Senior
Loan or (b) the amortization schedule for the Take Out Loan is no shorter than
the current amortization schedule for the Senior Loan, (iii) the interest rate
for the Take Out Loan is not greater than the prevailing



                                      C-17
<PAGE>   131

market interest rates for similar types of loans at the time of the refinancing
and (iv) if the Take Out Loan does not produce sufficient proceeds to also repay
the Mezzanine Loan in full, all amounts in excess of amounts due on the Senior
Loan plus reasonable costs of the Take Out Loan are applied pursuant to the
terms of the refinancing loan to the outstanding principal amount of the
Mezzanine Loan and the Take Out Loan shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement..

             (d) ANNUAL BUDGET. The Mezzanine Lender shall have the right to
reasonably approve the annual operating budget of the Borrower in accordance
with the terms of the Mezzanine Loan Documents. In the event the Mezzanine
Lender objects to any such proposed budget, the Mezzanine Lender shall advise
the Senior Lender of such objections, along with its suggestions for changes,
within five (5) days after its receipt of such budget in accordance with the
Mezzanine Loan Documents. The Mezzanine Lender shall consent to any changes in
the budget requested by the Senior Lender.

             (e) CONSENT RIGHTS. If the Mezzanine Loan Documents contain any
provision or requirement that Mezzanine Lender's consent or approval be obtained
for any act or determination by Borrower or Mezzanine Borrower in connection
with the leasing of the Premises or alterations to the Premises, the Mezzanine
Lender hereby agrees that it shall first advise the Senior Lender of whether the
Mezzanine Lender objects to the requested consent or approval within ten (10)
days after its receipt of a written request for a consent or approval from the
Mezzanine Borrower. To the extent that such consent or approval is also required
by the Senior Lender under the Senior Loan Documents, the Senior Lender shall
consult with the Mezzanine Lender with respect to any such consent or approval
right of the Mezzanine Lender. The Mezzanine Lender agrees that the Senior
Lender's decision with respect to such consent or approval request shall govern.
In addition, any right of Mezzanine Lender with respect to providing consent or
approval to actions or determinations of the Borrower or Mezzanine Borrower
relating to the Premises or the Senior Loan Documents shall be subject and
limited to all rights of the Senior Lender as set forth in this Agreement.

         10. PURCHASE OF SENIOR LOAN. Mezzanine Lender shall have the right of
first offer to purchase the Senior Note in an amount equal to the outstanding
principal plus accrued interest and any prepayment fees, advances made by, or on
behalf of, the Senior Lender and other amounts owing under the Senior Loan
Documents (including the lesser of default interest and the costs, fees and
interest on advances due to, or incurred by, the servicer, special servicer,
trustee or fiscal agent with respect to the Senior Loan) for a period of 30 days
following receipt of written notice of an Event of Default under the Senior Loan
Documents and the acceleration of the Senior Loan, whereupon Senior Lender will
accept such payment in accordance with the Borrower's rights under the Senior
Loan Documents to repay the Senior Loan, notwithstanding the occurrence and
continuance of an Event of Default and will take such actions under the Senior
Loan Documents as it would otherwise take upon a repayment of the Senior Loan by
Borrower, provided that Mezzanine Lender shall not be required to pay any late
charges or any default interest in excess of the costs, fees and interest on
advances due to, or incurred by, the servicer, special servicer, trustee, or
fiscal agent of the Senior Loan if the Event of Default is a maturity date
payment default under the Senior Loan. Upon such purchase and upon Mezzanine
Lender's request, Senior Lender will assign all of its right, title and interest
in and to the Senior Note and the Senior Loan Documents to Mezzanine Lender or
its designee, without



                                      C-18
<PAGE>   132

representation, warranty or covenant, express or implied of any kind whatsoever,
except as to Senior Lender's free and clear ownership thereof and the
outstanding principal balance of the Senior Loan. If and when the Senior Loan is
purchased pursuant to this Section 10 and the Mezzanine Loan shall remain
outstanding, then upon Mezzanine Lender's request, Senior Lender shall assign to
Mezzanine Lender all of Senior Lender's right, title and interest in, to and
under the Senior Lender's Lockbox Agreement and all accounts thereunder, without
recourse, representation or warranty, express or implied of any nature or kind
whatsoever. The right of Mezzanine Lender to purchase the Senior Loan shall
automatically terminate upon a foreclosure sale, sale by power of sale or
delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or sale of the Senior Loan by the
Senior Lender in connection with an Event of Default under the Senior Loan.

         11. OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER NOT AFFECTED.

             (a) All rights, interests, agreements and obligations of Senior
Lender and Mezzanine Lender under this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect irrespective of:

                 (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Senior Loan
Documents or the Mezzanine Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument
relating thereto;

                 (ii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
other collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
or departure from any guaranty, for all or any portion of the Senior Loan or the
Mezzanine Loan;

                 (iii) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
thereof, to all or any portion of the Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan, or any
manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any portion of
the Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan or any other assets of Borrower or
Mezzanine Borrower or any other Affiliates of Borrower;

                 (iv) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
structure or existence of Borrower or Mezzanine Borrower or any other Affiliates
of Borrower; or

                 (v) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
defense available to, or a discharge of, Borrower, Mezzanine Borrower or a
subordinated creditor or a Senior Lender subject to the terms hereof.

             (b) This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,
as the case may be, if at any time any payment of all or any portion of the
Senior Loan is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Senior Lender or
Mezzanine Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower
or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

         12. TRANSFERS.

             (a) Senior Lender may, from time to time, in its sole discretion
upon written notice to Mezzanine Lender, Transfer all or any of the Senior Loan
or any interest therein, provided that the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall be binding on Senior Lender's successors and assigns, and
notwithstanding any such Transfer or subsequent Transfer, the Senior Loan and
the Senior Loan Documents shall be and remain a senior obligation in the



                                      C-19
<PAGE>   133

respects set forth in this Agreement to the Mezzanine Loan and the Mezzanine
Loan Documents in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

             (b) Mezzanine Lender may not Transfer all or any of the Mezzanine
Loan or any interest therein without the written consent of the Senior Lender
and receipt of a Rating Confirmation Letter, except for a Transfer: (x) to an
Institutional Lender/Owner, provided that any Institutional Lender/Owner assumes
in writing the obligations of Mezzanine Lender hereunder accruing from and after
such Transfer and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions hereof,
thereupon such Transfer to an Institutional Lender/Owner shall be deemed
permitted under the Senior Loan Documents, (y) to the counterparty to any
repurchase arrangement which is an Institutional Lender/Owner entered into by
Mezzanine Lender with respect to the Mezzanine Loan (a "REPURCHASE") or (z) to a
Loan Pledgee (as hereinafter defined). Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, Senior Lender consents to Mezzanine Lender's pledge (a "PLEDGE") of the
Mezzanine Loan and of the Separate Collateral to any Institutional Lender/Owner
which has extended a credit facility to Mezzanine Lender (a "LOAN PLEDGEE"), on
the terms and conditions set forth in this subsection (b). Upon written notice
by Mezzanine Lender to Senior Lender that the Pledge has been effected, Senior
Lender agrees to acknowledge receipt of such notice and thereafter agrees: (a)
to give Loan Pledgee written notice of any default by Mezzanine Lender under
this Agreement and any amendment, modification, waiver or termination of any of
Mezzanine Lender's rights under this Agreement; (b) that Senior Lender shall
deliver to Loan Pledgee such estoppel certificate(s) as Loan Pledgee shall
reasonably request, provided that any such certificate(s) shall be in the form
and upon the conditions set forth in Section 14 herein; and (c) that, upon
written notice (a "REDIRECTION NOTICE") to Senior Lender by Loan Pledgee that
Mezzanine Lender is in default, beyond applicable cure periods, under Mezzanine
Lender's obligations to Loan Pledgee pursuant to the applicable credit agreement
between Mezzanine Lender and Loan Pledgee (which notice need not be joined in or
confirmed by Mezzanine Lender), and until such Redirection Notice is withdrawn
or rescinded by Loan Pledgee, any payments to which the Mezzanine Lender is
entitled from time to time pursuant to this Agreement, or any other agreement
between Senior Lender and Mezzanine Lender that relates to the Senior Loan shall
be paid or directed to Loan Pledgee. Mezzanine Lender hereby unconditionally and
absolutely releases Senior Lender from any liability to Mezzanine Lender on
account of Senior Lender's compliance with any Redirection Notice reasonably
believed by Senior Lender to have been delivered in good faith. Loan Pledgee
shall be permitted to fully exercise its rights and remedies against Mezzanine
Lender, and realize on any and all collateral granted by Mezzanine Lender to
Loan Pledgee (and accept an assignment in lieu of foreclosure as to such
collateral), in accordance with applicable law and the provisions of this
Agreement. In such event, the Senior Lender shall recognize Loan Pledgee, and
its successors and assigns which are Institutional Lender/Owners as the
successor to Mezzanine Lender's rights, remedies and obligations under this
Agreement and the Mezzanine Loan Documents. The rights of Loan Pledgee under
this subsection (b) shall remain effective unless and until Loan Pledgee shall
have notified the Senior Lender in writing that its interest in the Mezzanine
Loan has terminated.

                  been continued indefinitely and the parties are obligated to
