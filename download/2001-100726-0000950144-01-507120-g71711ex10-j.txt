Commitment Percentage of revolving credit loans requested by the Borrower in

Committed Amount and (ii) with regard to each Lender individually, such Lender's

                  the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested

                  the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to
                  specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable

                  notice shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period
                  of one month, or (II) the type of Revolving Loan requested,
                  then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for a Base
                  Rate Loan hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give
                  notice to each affected Lender promptly upon receipt of each
                  Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the
                  contents thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing
                  to be made pursuant thereto.

                           (ii)     Minimum Amounts. Each Base Rate Loan that is

                  Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal

                  Committed Amount, if less).

                           (iii)    Advances. Each Lender will make its
                  Revolving Commitment Percentage of each Revolving Loan
                  borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the
                  account of the Borrower as specified in Section 3.15(a), or in

                  office with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
                  Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as
                  received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (c)      Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving

                           (iv)     the Revolving Committed Amount may not be
                  increased to an amount greater than THREE HUNDRED MILLION
                  DOLLARS ($300,000,000);

                           (v)      on or before the date on which such increase
                  is to become effective, the Administrative Agent shall have
                  received (A) for its own account, the mutually acceptable fees
                  and expenses paid in connection with such increase and (B) for
                  the account of each Person providing the increase in the
                  Revolving Committed Amount, a commitment fee on the amount of
                  such increase in an amount to be determined at such time;

                           (vi)     any such increase in the Revolving Committed
                  Amount shall be applied to (A) upon any existing Lender's
                  written consent, the Revolving Commitment of one or more
                  existing Lenders and/or (B) one or more institutions that is
                  not an existing Lender (each, a "New Lender"); provided that
                  (x) each New Lender is an Eligible Assignee and (y) if
                  applicable, such New Lender becomes a Lender hereunder
                  pursuant to the execution and delivery of an appropriate
                  joinder agreement or of counterparts to this Credit Agreement
                  in a manner acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative
                  Agent;

                           (vii)    if any Loans are outstanding at the time of
                  the increase in the Revolving Committed Amount, the Borrower
                  shall, if applicable, prepay one or more existing Loans (such
                  prepayment to be subject to Section 3.12) in an amount
                  necessary such that after giving effect to the increase in the
                  Revolving Committed Amount, each Lender will hold its pro rata
                  share (based on its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the
                  increased Revolving Committed Amount) of outstanding Loans;

                           (viii)   the Borrower shall execute and deliver such
                  Note(s) in favor of any New Lenders as are necessary; and

                           (ix)     Schedule 2.1(a) hereto shall be amended to
                  reflect the revised Revolving Commitment Percentages and
                  Commitments of the Lenders.

         2.2      LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

                  (a)      Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
         and of the LOC Documents, if any, and any other terms and conditions
         which the Issuing Lender may reasonably require and in reliance upon
         the representations and warranties set forth herein, the Issuing Lender
         agrees to issue, and each Lender severally agrees to participate in the
         issuance by the Issuing Lender of Letters of Credit in Dollars from
         time to time from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date as the
         Borrower may request, in a form acceptable to the Issuing Lender;
         provided, however, that (i) the LOC Obligations outstanding shall not
         at any time exceed the LOC Committed Amount, (ii) with regard to the
         Lenders collectively, the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
         outstanding plus LOC Obligations outstanding plus Swingline Loans
         outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount and (iii)
         with regard to each Lender individually, such Lender's pro rata share
         of outstanding Revolving Loan plus such Lender's pro rata share of LOC
         Obligations outstanding plus (other than the Swingline Lender) such
         Lender's pro rata share of Swingline Loans outstanding shall not exceed
         such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving
         Committed Amount. No Letter of Credit shall (x) have an original expiry
         date more than one year from the date of issuance or (y) as originally
         issued or as extended, have an expiry date extending beyond the
         Maturity Date. Each Letter of Credit (1) shall comply with the related
         LOC Documents and (2) may be issued only for the purposes set forth in
         Section 6.14 hereof. The issuance and expiry dates of each Letter of
         Credit shall be a Business Day.

                  (b)      Notice and Reports. The request for the issuance of a
         Letter of Credit shall be submitted by the Borrower to the Issuing
         Lender at least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of
         issuance. The Issuing Lender will, at least quarterly and more
         frequently upon request, disseminate to each of the Lenders a detailed
         report specifying the Letters of Credit which are then issued and
         outstanding and any activity with respect thereto which may have
         occurred since the date of the prior report, and including therein,
         among other things, the beneficiary, the face amount and the expiry
         date, as well as any payment or expirations which may have occurred.

                  (c)      Participation.

                           (i)      On the Closing Date, each Lender shall
                  automatically acquire a participation in the liability of the
                  Issuing Lender under each Existing Letter of Credit in an
                  amount equal to its pro rata share of the obligations under
                  such Existing Letter of Credit (based on the respective
                  Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders) and shall
                  absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be
                  obligated to pay to the Issuing Lender and discharge when due,
                  its pro rata share of the obligations arising under such
                  Existing Letter of Credit. Each Existing Letter of Credit
                  shall be deemed for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and
                  the other Credit Documents to be a Letter of Credit.

<PAGE>   31

                           (ii)     Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of
                  Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a
                  Participation Interest from the Issuing Lender in such Letter
                  of Credit and the obligations arising thereunder and any
                  collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal
                  to its pro rata share of the obligations under such Letter of
                  Credit (based on the respective Revolving Commitment
                  Percentages of the Lenders) and shall absolutely,
                  unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be obligated to pay
                  to the Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata
                  share of the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit.
                  Without limiting the scope and nature of each Lender's
                  Participation Interest in any Letter of Credit, to the extent
                  that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as required
                  hereunder or under any such Letter of Credit, each such Lender
                  shall pay to the Issuing Lender its pro rata share of such
                  unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the day of
                  notification by the Issuing Lender of an unreimbursed drawing
                  pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) below. The
                  obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender
                  shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
                  by the occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any
                  other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall not
                  relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to
                  reimburse the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit,
                  together with interest as hereinafter provided.

                  (d)      Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any
         Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower.
         Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the Issuing Lender that
         the Borrower intends to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender for such
         drawing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that the
         Lenders make a Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing as provided
         in subsection (e) below on the related Letter of Credit, the proceeds
         of which will be used to satisfy the related reimbursement obligations.
         The Borrower promises to reimburse the Issuing Lender on the day of
         drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a
         Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds. If
         the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender as provided
         hereinabove, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear
         interest at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%.
         The Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder shall be absolute
         and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any rights of
         setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower may claim or
         have against the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders,
         the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person,
         including without limitation any defense based on any failure of the
         Borrower or any other Credit Party to receive consideration or the
         legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of
         Credit. The Issuing Lender will promptly notify the other Lenders of
         the amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each Lender shall promptly
         pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender
         in Dollars and in immediately available funds, the amount of such
         Lender's pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing. Such payment
         shall be made on the day such notice is received by such Lender from
         the Issuing Lender if such notice is received at or


                                       30
<PAGE>   32

         before 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) otherwise such
         payment shall be made at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North
         Carolina time) on the Business Day next succeeding the day such notice
         is received. If such Lender does not pay such amount to the Issuing
         Lender in full upon such request, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to
         the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender interest
         on the unpaid amount during the period from the date of such drawing
         until such Lender pays such amount to the Issuing Lender in full at a
         rate per annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the
         date that such Lender is required to make payments of such amount
         pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Federal Funds Rate and
         thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation
         to make such payment to the Issuing Lender, and the right of the
         Issuing Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and
         unconditional, shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and
         without regard to the termination of this Credit Agreement or the
         Commitments hereunder, the existence of a Default or Event of Default
         or the acceleration of the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and
         shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
         whatsoever. Simultaneously with the making of each such payment by a
         Lender to the Issuing Lender, such Lender shall, automatically and
         without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or such
         Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an amount equal to such
         payment (excluding the portion of such payment constituting interest
         owing to the Issuing Lender) in the related unreimbursed drawing
         portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest thereon and in the
         related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against the Borrower with
         respect thereto.

                  (e)      Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which
         the Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a
         Revolving Loan advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit,
         the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a
         Revolving Loan has been requested or deemed requested by the Borrower
         to be made in connection with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in
         which case a Revolving Loan advance comprised of Base Rate Loans (or
         Eurodollar Loans to the extent the Borrower has complied with the
         procedures of Section 2.1(b)(i) with respect thereto) shall be
         immediately made to the Borrower by all Lenders (notwithstanding any
         termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) pro rata based
         on the respective Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders
         (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
         pursuant to Section 9.2) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid
         directly to the Issuing Lender for application to the respective LOC
         Obligations. Each such Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro
         rata share of each such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such
         request or deemed request in the amount, in the manner and on the date
         specified in the preceding sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of
         such borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for advances of
         Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any
         conditions specified in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a
         Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such
         request or deemed request for Revolving Loan to be made by the time
         otherwise required hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is
         a date on which Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made


                                       31
<PAGE>   33

         hereunder or (vi) any termination of the Commitments relating thereto
         immediately prior to or contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the
         event that any Revolving Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date
         otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of
         the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect
         to the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each such Lender
         hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such
         borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
         received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such
         purchase) from the Issuing Lender such Participation Interests in the
         outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each such
         Lender to share in such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the
         respective Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined
         before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to
         Section 9.2)), provided that at the time any purchase of Participation
         Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing
         Lender shall be required to pay to the Issuing Lender, to the extent
         not paid to the Issuer by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of
         subsection (d) above, interest on the principal amount of Participation
         Interests purchased for each day from and including the day upon which
         such borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date
         of payment for such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if
         paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan
         advance, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the
         Base Rate.

                  (f)      Designation of Credit Parties as Account Parties.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit
         Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.2(a), a Letter of
         Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such
         Letter of Credit is issued for the account of a Credit Party other than
         the Borrower, provided that notwithstanding such statement, the
         Borrower shall be the actual account party for all purposes of this
         Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement shall not
         affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect
         to such Letter of Credit.

                  (g)      Renewal, Extension. The renewal or extension of any
         Letter of Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects
         the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

                  (h)      Uniform Customs and Practices. The Issuing Lender may
         have the Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and
         Practice for Documentary Credits (the "UCP") or the International
         Standby Practices 1998 (the "ISP98"), in either case, as published as
         of the date of issue by the International Chamber of Commerce, in which
         case the UCP or ISP98 may be incorporated therein and deemed in all
         respects to be a part thereof.

                  (i)      Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.


                                       32
<PAGE>   34

                           (i)      In addition to its other obligations under
                  this Section 2.2, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and
                  protect, indemnify and save each Lender harmless from and
                  against, any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages,
                  losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) that such Lender may incur or be subject to
                  as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of
                  any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender to
                  honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any
                  act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present
                  or future de jure or de facto government or Governmental
                  Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called
                  "Government Acts").

                           (ii)     As between the Borrower and the Lenders
                  (including the Issuing Lender), the Borrower shall assume all
                  risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit
                  by the beneficiary thereof. No Lender (including the Issuing
                  Lender) shall be responsible: (A) for the form, validity,
                  sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
                  document submitted by any party in connection with the
                  application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if
                  it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
                  insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the
                  validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
                  assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of
                  Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
                  thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or
                  ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors, omissions,
                  interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
                  messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise,
                  whether or not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in
                  the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
                  order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the
                  proceeds thereof; and (E) for any consequences arising from
                  causes beyond the control of such Lender, including, without
                  limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall
                  affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender's
                  rights or powers hereunder.

                           (iii)    In furtherance and extension and not in
                  limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth,
                  any action taken or omitted by any Lender (including the
                  Issuing Lender), under or in connection with any Letter of
                  Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in
                  good faith, shall not put such Lender under any resulting
                  liability to the Borrower or any other Credit Party. It is the
                  intention of the parties that this Credit Agreement shall be
                  construed and applied to protect and indemnify each Lender
                  (including the Issuing Lender) against any and all risks
                  involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of
                  which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower (on behalf of
                  itself and each of the other Credit Parties), including,
                  without limitation, any and all Government Acts. No Lender
                  (including the Issuing Lender) shall, in any way, be liable
                  for any failure by such Lender or anyone else to pay any
                  drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any
                  Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of such
                  Lender.

                           (iv)     Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended
                  to limit the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower
                  contained in subsection (d) above. The obligations of the
                  Borrower under this subsection (i) shall survive the
                  termination of this Credit Agreement. No act or omission of
                  any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall
                  in any way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders
                  (including the Issuing Lender) to enforce any right, power or
                  benefit under this Credit Agreement.

                           (v)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                  contained in this subsection (i), the Borrower shall have no
                  obligation to indemnify any Lender (including the Issuing
                  Lender) in respect of any liability incurred by such Lender
                  (A) arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful
                  misconduct of such Lender, as determined by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction, or (B) caused by such Lender's failure
                  to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation to it of
                  a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of
                  such Letter of Credit, as determined by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction, unless such payment is prohibited by any law,
                  regulation, court order or decree.

                  (j)      Responsibility of Issuing Lender. It is expressly
         understood and agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender
         hereunder to the Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this
         Credit Agreement and that the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to
         assume that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 have been
         satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge that any such
         condition precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however, that
         nothing set forth in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to prejudice the
         right of any Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any amounts made
         available by such Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section
         2.2 in the event that it is determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit
         constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
         Issuing Lender.

                  (k)      Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any
         conflict between this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including
         any letter of credit application), this Credit Agreement shall control.

         2.3      SWINGLINE LOANS SUBFACILITY.

                  (a)      Swingline Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
         set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents and in reliance upon
         the representations and warranties set forth herein, the Swingline
         Lender hereby agrees, to make loans to the Borrower in Dollars at any
         time and from time to time from the Closing Date to but not including
         the Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Revolving Commitments
         shall have been terminated as provided herein (each such loan, a
         "Swingline Loan" and collectively, the "Swingline Loans"); provided
         that (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans
         outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Swingline Committed
         Amount


                                       34
<PAGE>   36

         and (ii) with regard to the Lenders collectively, the aggregate
         principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding plus LOC Obligations
         outstanding plus Swingline Loans outstanding shall not exceed the
         Revolving Committed Amount. Prior to the Maturity Date, Swingline Loans
         may be repaid and reborrowed by the Borrower in accordance with the
         provisions hereof.

                  (b)      Method of Borrowing and Funding Swingline Loans. By
         no later than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), on the date
         of the requested borrowing of Swingline Loans, the Borrower shall
         telephone the Swingline Lender as well as submit a Swingline Loan
         Request to the Swingline Lender in the form of Exhibit 2.3(b) setting
         forth (i) the amount of the requested Swingline Loan, (ii) whether the
         Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the Adjusted Base Rate or the
         Adjusted CD Rate and (iii) the date of the requested Swingline Loan and
         complying in all respects with Section 5.2. The Swingline Lender shall
         initiate the transfer of funds representing the Swingline Loan advance
         to the Borrower by 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day of the requested
         borrowing. Each Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $250,000
         and in integral multiples of $50,000 in excess thereof.

                  (c)      Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans. The
         principal amount of all Swingline Loans shall be due and payable on the
         earlier of (i) a date not more than fourteen (14) Business Days from
         the date of advance thereof and (ii) the Maturity Date. Each repayment
         of a Swingline Loan may be accomplished by requesting Revolving Loans
         which request is not subject to the conditions set forth in Section
         5.2. In the event that the Borrower shall fail to timely repay any
         Swingline Loan, and in any event upon (i) a request by the Swingline
         Lender, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section
         9.1(f) or (iii) the acceleration of any Loan or termination of any
         Commitment pursuant to Section 9.2, each other Lender shall irrevocably
         and unconditionally purchase from the Swingline Lender, without
         recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such
         Swingline Loan in an amount equal to such other Lender's Revolving
         Commitment Percentage thereof, by directly purchasing a participation
         in such Swingline Loan in such amount (regardless of whether the
         conditions precedent thereto set forth in Section 5.2 are then
         satisfied, whether or not the Borrower has submitted a Notice of
         Borrowing and whether or not the Commitments are then in effect, any
         Event of Default exists or all the Loans have been accelerated) and
         paying the proceeds thereof to the Swingline Lender at the address
         provided in Section 11.1, or at such other address as the Swingline
         Lender may designate, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. If
         such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline Lender by
         any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such
         amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest
         thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal
         Funds Rate. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
         Swingline Lender's demand therefor, and until such time as such Lender
         makes the required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to
         continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such
         unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Credit
         Documents other than those provisions requiring the other Lenders to
         purchase


                                       35
<PAGE>   37

         a participation therein. Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have
         assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its
         Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder to the Swingline
         Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in
         Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this
         Section 2.4(c) until such amount has been purchased (as a result of
         such assignment or otherwise). The principal amount of all Swingline
         Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless
         accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2 or required to be repaid by
         the Swingline Lender pursuant to the foregoing terms of this Section
         2.4(c).

                  (d)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,
         each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to
         either (i) the Adjusted Base Rate or (ii) the Adjusted CD Rate.
         Interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable in arrears on each
         applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be
         specified herein).

                  (e)      Swingline Note. The Swingline Loans made by the
         Swingline Lender shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note
         of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in the face amount of the
         Swingline Committed Amount and in substantially the form of Exhibit
         2.3(e).

                                    SECTION 3

                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

         3.1      DEFAULT RATE.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the
rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, whether
in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then the Adjusted Base Rate plus
2%).

         3.2      EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
provided in Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans
or extended as Eurodollar Loans for new Interest Periods only on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) without the consent of the Required
Lenders, Eurodollar Loans may be extended, and Base Rate Loans may be converted
into Eurodollar Loans, only if the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2
are satisfied on the date of extension or conversion, (iii) Loans extended as,
or converted into, Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the terms of the
definition of "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and


                                       36
<PAGE>   38

shall be in such minimum amounts as provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii), (iv) no more
than six Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being
understood that, for purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest
Periods shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on
the same date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in
accordance with the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing
Interest Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest
Period) and (v) any request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan
which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request
for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension or conversion shall be
effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the office of the
Administrative Agent specified in specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at such other
office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, prior to 11:00 A.M.
(Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day of, in the case of the
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and on the third Business
Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a Eurodollar Loan as, or
conversion of a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the date of the proposed
extension or conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or
conversion, the Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of Loans into
which such Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate, the applicable
Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each request for extension or conversion
shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a representation and warranty by the
Borrower of the matters specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of
Section 5.2. In the event the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion
of any Eurodollar Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion
or extension is not permitted or required by this Section, then such Eurodollar
Loan shall be automatically converted into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each
Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed extension or
conversion affecting any Loan.

         3.3      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
         right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time; provided,
         however, that each partial prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum
         principal amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000.
         Subject to the foregoing terms, amounts prepaid under this Section
         3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect; provided that if the
         Borrower fails to specify a voluntary prepayment then such prepayment
         shall be applied to Revolving Loans, in each case first to Base Rate
         Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period
         maturities. All prepayments under this Section 3.3(a) shall be subject
         to Section 3.12, but otherwise without premium or penalty and shall be
         accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the
         date of prepayment.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i)      Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time
                  (A) the sum of the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans
                  outstanding plus the aggregate amount of LOC Obligations
                  outstanding plus the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans


                                       37
<PAGE>   39

                  outstanding shall exceed the Revolving Committed Amount, (B)
                  the aggregate amount of LOC Obligations outstanding shall
                  exceed the LOC Committed Amount or (C) the amount of Swingline
                  Loans outstanding shall exceed the Swingline Committed Amount,
                  the Borrower shall immediately make payment on the Loans
                  and/or to a cash collateral account in respect of the LOC
                  Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                           (ii)     Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All
                  amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.3(b) shall
                  be applied first to Loans and then to a cash collateral
                  account to secure LOC Obligations. Within the parameters of
                  the applications set forth above, prepayments shall be applied
                  first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in
                  direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments
                  under this Section 3.3(b) shall be subject to Section 3.12.

         3.4      TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT.

                  The Borrower may from time to time permanently reduce or
         terminate the Revolving Committed Amount in whole or in part (in
         minimum aggregate amounts of $5,000,000 or in integral multiples of
         $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the full remaining amount of
         the then applicable Revolving Committed Amount)) upon five Business
         Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; provided, that,
         no such termination or reduction shall be made which would cause the
         aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the aggregate
         amount of LOC Obligations outstanding plus the aggregate amount of
         Swingline Loans outstanding to exceed the Revolving Committed Amount
         unless, concurrently with such termination or reduction, the Loans are
         repaid to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The
         Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender of
         receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from the Borrower
         pursuant to this Section 3.4.

         3.5      FEES.

                  (a)      Facility Fee. In consideration of the Revolving
         Commitments of the Lenders hereunder, the Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders (based on
         each Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving
         Committed Amount) a fee (the "Facility Fee") equal to the product of
         (i) the Applicable Percentage for Facility Fees multiplied by (ii) the
         Revolving Committed Amount. The Facility Fee shall commence to accrue
         on the Closing Date and shall be due and payable in arrears on the last
         Business Day of each March, June, September and December (and any date
         that the Revolving Committed Amount is reduced as provided in Section
         3.4 and the Maturity Date) for the immediately preceding quarter (or
         portion thereof), beginning with the first of such dates to occur after
         the Closing Date.

                  (b)      Letter of Credit Fees.


                                       38
<PAGE>   40

                           (i)      Letter of Credit Issuance Fee. In
                  consideration of the issuance of standby Letters of Credit
                  hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative
                  Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Letter of
                  Credit Fee") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage
                  of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn
                  under each such standby Letter of Credit computed at a per
                  annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date
                  of expiration equal to the Applicable Percentage. The Standby
                  Letter of Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on
                  the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
                  December for the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion
                  thereof).

                           (ii)     Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the
                  Letter of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (i) above, the
                  Borrower promises to pay to the Issuing Lender for its own
                  account without sharing by the other Lenders (A) a letter of
                  credit fronting fee of one-tenth percent (1/10%) per annum on
                  the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under
                  outstanding Letters of Credit payable quarterly in arrears
                  with the Letter of Credit Fee, and (B) customary charges from
                  time to time of the Issuing Lender with respect to the
                  issuance, amendment, transfer, administration, cancellation
                  and conversion of, and drawings under, such Letters of Credit
                  (collectively, the "Issuing Lender Fees").

         3.6      CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the adoption
or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or
compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then,
upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for such reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts
owing under this Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding
on the parties hereto.

         3.7      LIMITATION ON EURODOLLAR LOANS.

         If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Loan:

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent determines (which
         determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances
         affecting the relevant market, adequate and


                                       39
<PAGE>   41

         reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for
         such Interest Period; or

                  (b)      the Required Lenders determine (which determination
         shall be conclusive) and notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will
         not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding
         Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and
so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no
obligation to make additional Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans, or to
convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the
last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Eurodollar Loans or convert such Eurodollar
Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit
Agreement.

         3.8      ILLEGALITY.

         Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof
occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make
or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement, (a) such
Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such
circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to
make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Base Rate
Loan to Eurodollar Loans, shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time as it
shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Base Rate Loan
when a Eurodollar Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding
as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans
on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the
then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.13.

         3.9      REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

         If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

                           (i)      shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable
         Lending Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any
         Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, or its obligation


                                       40
<PAGE>   42

         to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis of taxation of any
         amounts payable to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under
         this Credit Agreement or its Notes in respect of any Eurodollar Loans
         (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Lender by
         the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or such
         Applicable Lending Office);

                           (ii)     shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any
         reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other
         than the Eurodollar Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination
         of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit
         or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or
         commitments of, such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office),
         including the Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or

                           (iii)    shall impose on such Lender (or its
         Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other
         condition affecting this Credit Agreement or its Notes or any of such
         extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or
its Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender on demand such amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender requests compensation by the
Borrower under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender
to make or continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
Lender to receive the compensation so requested. Each Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender,
be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming compensation under this
Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a
statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

         3.10     TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.

         If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the


                                       41
<PAGE>   43

last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans
(or, in the case of a conversion required by Section 3.8 hereof, on such earlier
date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided
below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave
rise to such conversion no longer exist:

                  (a)      to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
         have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that
         would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be
         applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

                  (b)      all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued
         by such Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued instead
         as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would
         otherwise be converted into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate
         Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave
rise to the conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this
Section 3.10 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such
circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other
Lenders are outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically
converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for
such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving
effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by
such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

         3.11     TAXES.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for
         the account of any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or
         under any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and
         without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties,
         levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
         liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender
         and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and
         franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of
         which such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the
         Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
         subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies,
         imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being
         hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall be
         required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
         payable under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document to any
         Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
         increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
         (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
         Section 3.11) such Lender or the Administrative Agent receives an
         amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
         been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make such


                                       42
<PAGE>   44

         deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted
         to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance
         with applicable law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall furnish to the
         Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 11.1, the
         original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all
         present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
         property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any
         payment made under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to,
         this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document (hereinafter
         referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the
         Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
         (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
         asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section
         3.11) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
         be) and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses)
         arising therefrom or with respect thereto.

                  (d)      Each Lender that is not a United States person under
         Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, on or prior to the date of its
         execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement in the case of each
         Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date
         on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
         time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower or the
         Administrative Agent (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully
         able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
         with (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI, as
         appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
         Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an
         income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces
         the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that
         the income receivable pursuant to this Credit Agreement is effectively
         connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States,
         (ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, or any
         successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and (iii)
         any other form or certificate required by any taxing authority
         (including any certificate required by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of
         the Internal Revenue Code), certifying that such Lender is entitled to
         an exemption from or a reduced rate of tax on payments pursuant to this
         Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents. Each Lender that
         is a United States Person shall submit a properly completed and duly
         executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor form
         prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that it is
         exempt from backup withholding.

                  (e)      For any period with respect to which a Lender has
         failed to provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the
         appropriate form pursuant to Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is
         due to a change in treaty, law, or regulation occurring subsequent to
         the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such
         Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 3.11(a)
         or 3.11(b) with


                                       43
<PAGE>   45

         respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided, however, that
         should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced
         rate of withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure
         to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such
         steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
         recover such Taxes.

                  (f)      If any Credit Party is required to pay additional
         amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section
         3.11, then such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change
         the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or
         reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such
         change, in the judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (g)      Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment
         of Taxes, the applicable Credit Party shall furnish to the
         Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
         evidencing such payment.

                  (h)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
         agreement of the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and
         obligations of the Credit Parties contained in this Section 3.11 shall
         survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other
         obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the
         Commitments hereunder.

         3.12     COMPENSATION.

         Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense (including loss of
anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

                  (a)      any payment, prepayment, or conversion of a
         Eurodollar Loan for any reason (including, without limitation, (i) in
         connection with any assignment by Bank of America pursuant to Section
         11.3(b) as part of the syndication of the Loans during the 180-day
         period immediately following the Closing Date) and (ii) the
         acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 9.2) on a date other than
         the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower for any reason
         (including, without limitation, the failure of any condition precedent
         specified in Section 5 to be satisfied) to borrow, convert, continue,
         or prepay a Eurodollar Loan on the date for such borrowing, conversion,
         continuation, or prepayment specified in the relevant notice of
         borrowing, prepayment, continuation, or conversion under this Credit
         Agreement.

With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued,
for the period from the date of such prepayment or


                                       44
<PAGE>   46

of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the applicable
Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue,
the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in
each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided
for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Percentage included therein, if
any) over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender)
which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar
market. The covenants of the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.12 shall
survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under
the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

         3.13     PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

                  (a)      Loans. Each Loan, each payment or (subject to the
         terms of Section 3.3) prepayment of principal of any Loan or
         reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of
         Credit, each payment of interest on the Loans or reimbursement
         obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment
         of Facility Fees, each payment of the Letter of Credit Fee, each
         reduction in Commitments and each conversion or extension of any Loan,
         shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the
         respective principal amounts of their outstanding Revolving Loans and
         Participation Interests.

                  (b)      Advances. No Lender shall be responsible for the
         failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make its
         ratable share of a borrowing hereunder; provided, however, that the
         failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not
         relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the
         Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender
         prior to the date of any requested borrowing that such Lender does not
         intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its ratable share
         of such borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may
         assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the
         Administrative Agent on the date of such borrowing, and the
         Administrative Agent in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
         discretion but without any obligation to do so) make available to the
         Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in
         fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
         Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such
         Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
         immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.
         The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the
         Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
         corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
         corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
         the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is


                                       45
<PAGE>   47

         recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i)
         from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing
         pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the
         Federal Funds Rate.

         3.14     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among
themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a
Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment,
including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such
Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan,
LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such Participation
Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if
any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative
Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit
Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made
together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other
Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a
secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies, such
Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this
Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         3.15     PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
         payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars
         in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim
         or withholding of any kind, at the Administrative


                                       46
<PAGE>   48

         Agent's office specified in Schedule 2.1(a) not later than 2:00 P.M.
         (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. Payments
         received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the
         next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent may (but shall
         not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not
         made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower or
         any other Credit Party maintained with the Administrative Agent (with
         notice to the Borrower or such other Credit Party). The Borrower shall,
         at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify
         to the Administrative Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest
         or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such
         payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify,
         or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the
         Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in
         such manner as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate
         in respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder, subject to
         the terms of Section 3.13(a)). The Administrative Agent will distribute
         such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to
         12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a Business Day in like
         funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise
         the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders
         on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder
         shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
         date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
         (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such
         extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the
         extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following
         calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next
         preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein,
         all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of
         actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. Interest shall
         accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of
         payment.

                  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the
         contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
         of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any
         other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be
         paid over or delivered as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of
         the Lenders under the Credit Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative
         Agent;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under
         the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
         consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                  FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Credit Party Obligations (including the payment or cash
         collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations);

                  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other
         obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit
         Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST"
         through "FIFTH" above; and

                  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

         In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in
         the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to
         the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an
         amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the
         then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to
         the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts
         available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH"
         and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available
         for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to
         the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such
         amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral
         account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from
         time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B)
         then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other
         obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above
         in the manner provided in this Section 3.15(b).

         3.16     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
         evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to
         time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
         to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each
         Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its
         account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from
         time to time, as necessary.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register
         pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
         Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the
         amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the
         amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
         and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
         received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account
         of any Credit Party and each


                                       48
<PAGE>   50

         Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable
         efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the
         preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to
         time, as necessary.

                  (c)      The entries made in the accounts, Register and
         subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.16
         (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent,
         subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
         amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties therein recorded;
         provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
         Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount,
         as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the
         obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Credit Party obligations
         owing to such Lender.

                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1      THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally
guarantees to each Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging
Agreement, and the Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary
obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Credit Party Obligations in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by
acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in
accordance with the terms thereof. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further
agree that if any of the Credit Party Obligations are not paid in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a
mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Subsidiary Guarantors will,
jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice
whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal
of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full
when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by
acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance
with the terms of such extension or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, the obligations of each
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to
the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to
avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions
of any applicable state law.

         4.2      OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 4.1 are
joint and several, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, irrespective of the
value, genuineness, validity,


                                       49
<PAGE>   51

regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees
that such Subsidiary Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity,
reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other Subsidiary
Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the Lenders
(and any Affiliates of Lenders entering into Hedging Agreements) have been paid
in full, all Commitments under this Credit Agreement have been terminated and no
Person or Governmental Authority shall have any right to request any return or
reimbursement of funds from the Lenders in connection with monies received under
the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements between any Credit Party and any
Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the
liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

                  (a)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Credit Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance
         or compliance shall be waived;

                  (b)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Credit
         Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender or any other
         agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such
         Hedging Agreements shall be done or omitted;

                  (c)      the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under
         any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Credit
         Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender or any other
         agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such
         Hedging Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the
         Credit Party Obligations or any security therefor shall be released,
         impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (d)      any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of
         the Credit Party Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e)      any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for
         the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor)


                                       50
<PAGE>   52

         or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including,
         without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all
notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under
any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Credit Party and
any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender or any other agreement or instrument
referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements, or against any
other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit
Party Obligations.

         4.3      REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 4 shall
be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment
by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it will
indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel)
incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such
rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in
defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference,
fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar law.

         4.4      CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this Section 4,
each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby specifically waives the benefits of N.C. Gen.
Stat. ss.ss. 26-7 through 26-9, inclusive, to the extent applicable. Each
Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that such Subsidiary Guarantor shall have no
right of recourse to security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through
the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the
exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

         4.5      REMEDIES.

         The Subsidiary Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit Party
Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in
Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in
the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration (or preventing the Credit Party Obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the
event of such declaration (or the Credit Party Obligations being deemed to have
become


                                       51
<PAGE>   53

automatically due and payable), the Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due
and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the
Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes of Section 4.1.

         4.6      RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any
Subsidiary Guarantor shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such
Subsidiary Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other
Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor's
Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The payment
obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the Guaranteed Obligations, and none of
the Subsidiary Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section
4.6 against any other Subsidiary Guarantor until payment and satisfaction in
full of all of such Guaranteed Obligations. For purposes of this Section 4.6,
(a) "Guaranteed Obligations" shall mean any obligations arising under the other
provisions of this Section 4; (b) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount paid by
any Subsidiary Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Guaranteed
Obligations; (c) "Pro Rata Share" shall mean, for any Subsidiary Guarantor in
respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a
percentage) as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the
amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets
and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such
Subsidiary Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and
unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair
salable value of all assets and other properties of all of the Credit Parties
exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent,
subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of the Credit Parties; provided,
however, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata Shares of the Subsidiary
Guarantors in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, any Subsidiary
Guarantor that became a Subsidiary Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such
payment shall be deemed to have been a Subsidiary Guarantor on the date of such
payment and the financial information for such Subsidiary Guarantor as of the
date such Subsidiary Guarantor became a Subsidiary Guarantor shall be utilized
for such Subsidiary Guarantor in connection with such payment; and (d)
"Contribution Share" shall mean, for any Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of any
Excess Payment made by any other Subsidiary Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a
percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds
the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including
contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding
the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other
properties of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment
exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent,
subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of the Credit Parties) of the Credit Parties other than the maker of
such Excess Payment; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the
Contribution


                                       52
<PAGE>   54

Shares of the Subsidiary Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any
Subsidiary Guarantor that became a Subsidiary Guarantor subsequent to the date
of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Subsidiary Guarantor
on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such
Subsidiary Guarantor as of the date such Subsidiary Guarantor became a
Subsidiary Guarantor shall be utilized for such Subsidiary Guarantor in
connection with such Excess Payment. This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to
affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that
any Subsidiary Guarantor may have under applicable law against the Borrower in
respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations.

         4.7      GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

                                    SECTION 5

                  (e)      No circumstances, events or conditions shall have
         occurred since June 25, 2000 which would have a Material Adverse
         Effect; and

                  (f)      Immediately after giving effect to the making of such

above.

                                    SECTION 6

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Credit Parties hereby represent to the Administrative Agent and

property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified to conduct business and in good

Effect, or (d) result in or require the creation of any Lien (other than those

         6.12     ERISA.

         Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect:

                  (a)      During the five-year period prior to the date on
         which this representation is made or deemed made: (i) no ERISA Event
         has occurred, and, to the best knowledge of the Credit Parties, no
         event or condition has occurred or exists as a result of which any
         ERISA Event could reasonably be expected to occur, with respect to any
         Plan; (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined
         in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not
         waived, has occurred with respect to any Plan; (iii) each Plan has been
         maintained, operated, and funded in compliance with its own terms and
         in material compliance with the provisions of ERISA, the Code, and any
         other applicable federal or state laws; and (iv) no lien in favor of
         the PBGC or a Plan has arisen or is reasonably likely to arise on
         account of any Plan.

                  (b)      The actuarial present value of all "benefit
         liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA), whether or
         not vested, under each Single Employer Plan, as of the last annual
         valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made
         or deemed made (determined, in each case, in accordance with Financial
         Accounting Standards Board Statement 87, utilizing the actuarial
         assumptions used in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation
         report), did not exceed as of such valuation date the fair market value
         of the assets of such Plan.

                  (c)      Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliate has incurred, or, to the best knowledge of the Credit
         Parties, could be reasonably expected to incur, any withdrawal
         liability under ERISA to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
         Plan. Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliate would
         become subject to any withdrawal liability under ERISA if any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw completely
         from all Multiemployer Plans and Multiple Employer Plans as of the
         valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
         representation is made or deemed made. Neither any Consolidated Party
         nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any notification that any
         Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section
         4241 of ERISA), is insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of
         ERISA), or has been terminated (within the meaning of Title IV of
         ERISA), and no Multiemployer Plan is, to the best knowledge of the
         Credit Parties, reasonably expected to be in reorganization, insolvent,
         or terminated.

         Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of
         fiduciary responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which has
         subjected or may subject any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate
         to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or
         Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other instrument
         pursuant to which any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate has
         agreed or is required to indemnify any Person against any such
         liability.


                                       59
<PAGE>   61

                  (e)      Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliates has any material liability with respect to "expected
         post-retirement benefit obligations" within the meaning of the
         Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106. Each Plan which is
         a welfare plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) to which Sections
         601-609 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code apply has been
         administered in compliance in all material respects of such sections.

                  (f)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Credit
         Agreement nor the consummation of the financing transactions
         contemplated thereunder will involve any transaction which is subject
         to the prohibitions of Sections 404, 406 or 407 of ERISA or in
         connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section 4975
         of the Code. The representation by the Credit Parties in the preceding
         sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the
         Lenders' representation in Section 11.15 with respect to their source
         of funds and is subject, in the event that the source of the funds used
         by the Lenders in connection with this transaction is an insurance
         company's general asset account, to the application of Prohibited
         Transaction Class Exemption 95-60, 60 Fed. Reg. 35,925 (1995),
         compliance with the regulations issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of
         ERISA, or the issuance of any other prohibited transaction exemption or
         similar relief, to the effect that assets in an insurance company's
         general asset account do not constitute assets of an "employee benefit
         plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA of a "plan" within
         the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code.

         6.13     SUBSIDIARIES.

         Set forth on Schedule 6.13 is a complete and accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of each Consolidated Party.

         6.14     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      No part of the Letters of Credit or proceeds of the
         Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, in any manner that would
         constitute a violation of Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X.
         "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not constitute
         more than 25% of the value of the consolidated assets of the
         Consolidated Parties. None of the transactions contemplated by this
         Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect
         use of the proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation
         of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange
         Act of 1934, as amended, or regulations issued pursuant thereto, or
         Regulation T, U or X. If requested by any Lender or Administrative
         Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each
         Lender a statement to the effect of the foregoing sentences in
         conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in
         Regulation U.

         the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act
         or the Investment Company Act of 1940, each as amended. In addition, no
         Consolidated Party is (i) an "investment company" registered or
         required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
         amended, and is not controlled by such a company, or (ii) a "holding
         company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an
         "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a "holding
         company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
         of 1935, as amended.

                  (c)      No director, executive officer or principal
         shareholder of any Consolidated Party is a director, executive officer
         or principal shareholder of any Lender. For the purposes hereof the
         terms "director", "executive officer" and "principal shareholder" (when
         used with reference to any Lender) have the respective meanings
         assigned thereto in Regulation O issued by the Board of Governors of
         the Federal Reserve System.

                  (d)      Each Consolidated Party has obtained and holds in
         full force and effect, all franchises, licenses, permits, certificates,
         authorizations, qualifications, accreditations, easements, rights of
         way and other rights, consents and approvals which are necessary for
         the ownership of its respective Property and to the conduct of its
         respective businesses as presently conducted.

                  (e)      No Consolidated Party is in violation of any
         applicable statute, regulation or ordinance of the United States of
         America, or of any state, city, town, municipality, county or any other
         jurisdiction, or of any agency thereof (including without limitation,
         environmental laws and regulations), which violation could have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f)      Each Consolidated Party is current with all material
         reports and documents, if any, required to be filed with any state or
         federal securities commission or similar agency and is in full
         compliance in all material respects with all applicable rules and
         regulations of such commissions.

         The proceeds of the Loans hereunder shall be used solely by the
Borrower (i) for working capital, (ii) to make Consolidated Capital
Expenditures, (iii) for general corporate purposes, (iv) to refinance existing
Indebtedness of the Borrower and (v) to make Permitted Acquisitions. The Letters

not otherwise aforementioned relating to transactions entered into by the
applicable account party in the ordinary course of business.

         administrative action is pending or, to the best knowledge of any
         Credit Party, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which any

         consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders
         or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements
         outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the
         Consolidated Parties, the Properties or the Businesses.

trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes (the
"Intellectual Property") necessary for each of them to conduct its business as

to use could not have a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted and
is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any such
Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual
Property, nor does any Credit Party know of any such claim, and to the Credit
Parties' knowledge the use of such Intellectual Property by any Consolidated

         Parties to the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder
         to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable
         without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all
         of which are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

                  (c)      Cash Collateral. Direct the Credit Parties to pay

         immediately pay) to the Administrative Agent additional cash, to be
         held by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in a
         cash collateral account as additional security for the LOC Obligations
         in respect of subsequent drawings under all then outstanding Letters of
         Credit in an amount equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be
         drawn under all Letters of Credits then outstanding.

arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, all accrued interest in respect
thereof, all accrued and unpaid Fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing
to the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder automatically
shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of any notice or
other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders.

unless and until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and
Acceptance executed in accordance with Section 11.3(b) hereof. As to any matters
not expressly provided for by this Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall
be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders,
and such instructions shall be binding on all of the Lenders; provided, however,
that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that
exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to
any Credit Document or applicable law or unless it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking any such action.

         10.3     DEFAULTS.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or a Credit Party
specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating


                                       79
<PAGE>   81

that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative
Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default,
the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 10.2 hereof) take such action
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed
by the Required Lenders, provided that, unless and until the Administrative
Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interest of the Lenders.

         10.4     RIGHTS AS A LENDER.

         With respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by it, Bank of
America (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) in its capacity as a
Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the
context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. Bank of America (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) and
its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept
deposits from, lend money to, make investments in, provide services to, and
generally engage in any kind of lending, trust, or other business with any
Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as if it were not acting
as Administrative Agent, and Bank of America (and any successor acting as
Administrative Agent) and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration
from any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for services in
connection with this Credit Agreement or otherwise without having to account for
the same to the Lenders.

         10.5     INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent
not reimbursed under Section 11.5 hereof, but without limiting the obligations
of the Credit Parties under such Section) ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' fees), or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (including
by any Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit Document or
the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted by the
Administrative Agent under any Credit Document (including any of the foregoing
arising from the negligence of the Administrative Agent); provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the
Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
expenses payable by the Credit Parties under Section 11.5, to the extent that
the Administrative Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses
by the Credit Parties. The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive the
repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit
Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

<PAGE>   82

         10.6     NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries and decision to enter into this Credit
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit
Documents. Except for notices, reports, and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition, or business of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates.

         10.7     SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Credit Parties. Upon any such resignation, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative
Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder
by a successor, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent, as appropriate, under this
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the provisions of this
Section 10.7 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no
successor Administrative Agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent
within sixty (60) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving notice
of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless become effective and the Lenders shall perform all duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Subject to the
foregoing terms of this Section 10.7, there shall at all times be a Person or
Persons serving as Administrative Agent hereunder.

         11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF; ADJUSTMENTS.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender (or any
of its Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party
against any and all of the obligations of such Person now or hereafter existing
under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes, under any other Credit Document or
otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand under
hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify any affected Credit Party after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 11.2 are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Lender may have.

         11.3     BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT.

                  (a)      This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
         to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
         assigns of the parties hereto; provided that none of the Credit Parties
         may assign or transfer any of its interests and obligations without
         prior written consent of the Lenders; provided further that the rights
         of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant participations in its
         rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be limited as set forth in
         this Section 11.3.

                  (b)      Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
         Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
         Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of
         its Loans, its Notes, and its Commitment); provided, however, that

                           (i)      each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
                  Assignee;

                           (ii)     except in the case of an assignment to
                  another Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights
                  and obligations under this Credit Agreement, any such partial
                  assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to


                                       83
<PAGE>   85

                  $5,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the
                  Commitment being assigned by such Lender) or an integral
                  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;

                           (iii)    each such assignment by a Lender shall be of
                  a constant, and not varying, percentage of all of its rights
                  and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the Notes; and

                           (iv)     the parties to such assignment shall execute
                  and deliver to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance an
                  Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit 11.3(b)
                  hereto, together with any Note subject to such assignment and
                  a processing fee of $3,500.

         Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and
         Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
         extent of such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits
         of a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of
         such assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its
         obligations under this Credit Agreement. Upon the consummation of any
         assignment pursuant to this Section 11.3(b), the assignor, the
         Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties shall make appropriate
         arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are issued to the assignor
         and the assignee. If the assignee is not a United States person under
         Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, it shall deliver to the Credit Parties
         and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from
         deduction or withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 3.11.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its
         address referred to in Section 11.1 a copy of each Assignment and
         Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the
         recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
         Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender
         from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall
         be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and
         the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
         each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender
         hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Register shall
         be available for inspection by the Credit Parties or any Lender at any
         reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
         executed by the parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such
         assignment and payment of the processing fee, the Administrative Agent
         shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in
         substantially the form of Exhibit 11.3(b) hereto, (i) accept such
         Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
         therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the
         parties thereto.

                  (e)      Each Lender may sell participations to one or more
         Persons in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and
         obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment or its Loans); provided, however, that


                                       84
<PAGE>   86

         (i) such Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain
         unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
         participant shall be entitled to the benefit of the yield protection
         provisions contained in Sections 3.7 through 3.12, inclusive, and the
         right of set-off contained in Section 11.2, and (iv) the Credit Parties
         shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
         obligations of the Credit Parties relating to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender and to approve any amendment,
         modification, or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement
         (other than amendments, modifications, or waivers decreasing the amount
         of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on such Loans
         or Notes, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed
         for the payment of interest on such Loans or Notes, or extending its
         Commitment).

                  (f)      Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
         Credit Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or
         any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as
         collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular
         issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release
         the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

                  (g)      Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the
         Consolidated Parties in the possession of such Lender from time to time
         to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
         participants), subject, however, to the provisions of Section 11.14
         hereof.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, any Lender (a "Designating Lender") may grant to a special
         purpose funding vehicle (a "SPV"), identified as such in writing from
         time to time by the Designating Lender to the Administrative Agent and
         the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of
         any Loan that such Designating Lender would otherwise be obligated to
         make to the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement; provided that
         (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any
         Loan, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise
         fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Designating Lender
         shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof,
         (iii) the Designating Lender shall remain liable for any indemnity or
         other payment obligation with respect to its Commitment hereunder, (iv)
         no SPV shall have any voting rights pursuant to Section 11.1, (v) with
         respect to notices, payments and other matters hereunder, the Credit
         Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be
         obligated to deal with a SPV, but may limit their communications and
         other dealings relevant to such SPV to the applicable Granting Lender
         and (vi) each such SPV would satisfy the requirements of Section
         3.11(d) if such SPV were a Lender hereunder. The making of a Loan by an
         SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Designating Lender to
         the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Designating
         Lender. No additional Note shall be required to evidence the Loans or
         portion thereof made by an


                                       85
<PAGE>   87

         SPV; and the related Designating Lender shall be deemed to hold its
         Note as agent for such SPV to the extent of the Loans or portion
         thereof funded by such SPV. In addition, any payments for the account
         of any SPV shall be paid to its Designating Lender as agent for such
         SPV. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for
         any indemnity or payment under this Credit Agreement for which a Lender
         would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the
         Designating Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In
         furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
         agreement shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement) that,
         prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in
         full of all outstanding prior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not
         institute against, or join any other person in instituting against,
         such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
         liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the
         United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.3 or otherwise in
         this Credit Agreement, any SPV may (x) with notice to, but without the
         prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and
         without paying any processing fee therefor, assign or participate all
         or a portion of its interest in any Loans to the Designating Lender or
         to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or
         for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of
         Loans and (y) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
         information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial
         paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or
         liquidity enhancements to such SPV. This Section 11.3(h) may not be
         amended without the written consent of any Designating Lender affected
         thereby.

         11.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Administrative Agent or any
Lender and any of the Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or
thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5     EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)      The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to pay on
demand all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the
syndication, preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and
amendment of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit


                                       86
<PAGE>   88

Documents, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative
Agent (including the cost of internal counsel) with respect thereto and with
respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to its rights and
responsibilities under the Credit Documents. The Credit Parties further jointly
and severally agree to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and the cost of internal counsel), in
connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings, or otherwise) of the Credit Documents and the other documents to be
delivered hereunder.

         (b)      The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each of their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and
advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by or asserted or
awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in
connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection
with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding or preparation of defense in
connection therewith) the Credit Documents, any of the transactions contemplated
herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans (including any
of the foregoing arising from the negligence of the Indemnified Party), except
to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense is found in
a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the
indemnity in this Section 11.5 applies, such indemnity shall be effective
whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any of
the Credit Parties, their respective directors, shareholders or creditors or an
Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a
party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated. The Credit Parties agree not to assert any claim against the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive
damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Credit Documents, any of the
transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds
of the Loans.

         (c)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit
Parties contained in this Section 11.5 shall survive the repayment of the Loans,
LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the
termination of the Commitments hereunder.

         Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any of
the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in

                  thereon or Fees hereunder,

                           (c)      reduce or waive the principal amount of any

                  thereof, arising from drawings under Letters of Credit,

                           (d)      increase the Commitment of a Lender over the
                  amount thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that
                  a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or mandatory
                  reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute a change in
                  the terms of any Commitment of any Lender),

                           (e)      except as the result of or in connection
                  with a dissolution or merger permitted by Section 8.4, release
                  the Borrower or any Guarantor from its or their obligations
                  under the Credit Documents,

                           (f)      amend, modify or waive any provision of this
                  Section 11.6 or 9.1(a), 11.2, 11.3, 11.5 or 11.9,

                           (g)      reduce any percentage specified in, or
                  otherwise modify, the definition of Required Lenders, or

                           (h)      consent to the assignment or transfer by the
                  Borrower or all or substantially all of the other Credit
                  Parties of any of its or their rights and obligations under
                  (or in respect of) the Credit Documents except as permitted
                  thereby;

                  (ii)     without the consent of the Administrative Agent, no
         provision of Section 10 may be amended; and

                  (iii)    without the consent of the Issuing Lender, no
         provision of Section 2.2 may be amended, and without the consent of the
         Swingline Lender, no provision of Section 2.3 may be amended.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
         required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender
         is entitled to vote as such Lender sees


                                       88
<PAGE>   90

         fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the Loans, and
         each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of the
         Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth
         herein and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a Credit Party
         to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
         proceeding.

         11.7     COUNTERPARTS.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of

such counterpart for each of the parties hereto. Delivery by facsimile by any of
the parties hereto of an executed counterpart of this Credit Agreement shall be
as effective as an original executed counterpart hereof and shall be deemed a
representation that an original executed counterpart hereof will be delivered.

         11.8     HEADINGS.

                  (a)      THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY

         mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage
         prepaid, to it at the address set out for notices pursuant to Section
         11.1, such service to become effective three (3) days after such
         mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by
         law or to commence legal proceedings or to otherwise proceed against
         any Credit Party in any other jurisdiction.

                  (b)      Each of the Credit Parties hereby irrevocably waives
         any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
         of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in
         connection with this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         brought in the courts referred to in subsection (a) above and hereby
         further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such
         court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has
         been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT,
         ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
         HEREBY.

provisions.

         11.12    ENTIRETY.

         This Credit Agreement together with the other Credit Documents
represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and supersede

<PAGE>   92

         Party, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective
         successors and assigns.

         The Administrative Agent and each Lender (each, a "Lending Party")
agrees to keep confidential any information furnished or made available to it by
the Credit Parties pursuant to this Credit Agreement that is marked
confidential; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Lending Party from
disclosing such information (a) to any other Lending Party or any Affiliate of

Section 11.14, to any actual or proposed participant or assignee.

         11.15    USE OF SOURCES.

         Each of the Lenders hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower that
at least one of the following statements is an accurate representation as to the
course of funds to be used by such lender in connection with the financing
hereunder:

                  (a)      no part of such funds constitutes assets allocated to
         any separate account maintained by such lender in which any employee
         benefit plan (or its related trust) has any interest;

                  (b)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets allocated to any separate account maintained by such lender,
         such Lender has disclosed to the Borrower the name of each employee
         benefit plan whose assets in such account exceed 10% of the total
         assets of such account as of the date of such purchase (and, for
         purposes of this subsection (b), all employee benefit plans maintained
         by the same employer or employee organization are deemed to be a single
         plan;


                                       91
<PAGE>   93

                  (c)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets of an insurance company's general account, such insurance
         company has complied with all of the requirements of the regulations
         issued under Section 401(e)(a)(A) of ERISA; or

                  (d)      such funds constitute assets of one or more specific
         benefit plans which such Lender has identified in writing to the
         Borrower.

         As used in this Section 11.15, the terms "employee benefit plan" and
"separate account" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in
Section 3 of ERISA.

         11.16    CONFLICT.

         To the extent that there is a conflict or inconsistency between any
provision hereof, on the one hand, and any provision of any Credit Document, on
