ADJUSTMENT

                            settled based upon the following formula: (UEP + WP
                            after 10/2/005) X (1 less final ceding commission at
                            year end, less attritional loss ratio at year end,
                            less 100% of all PCS losses occurring on these

                            be based on the selected non-cat loss ratio used

                            will be estimated for these purposes as at 10/1/05
                            and is subject to adjustment on final settlement of
                            any balances due to the Company always subject to
                            agreement by the Reinsurer.
