interest rate charged with respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in
connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence)
under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the
Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of
interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the
stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition,
if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into
account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have
been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times
been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent an
amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which
would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable
usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which
constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled
automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender&#146;s option be applied to the outstanding
amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Borrower.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This <B>SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE </B>(this &#147;<B>Certificate</B>&#148;) is delivered in connection with the Amendment and
Restatement Agreement, dated as of the date of this Certificate (the &#147;<U>Amendment
Agreement</U>&#148;), by and among Las Vegas Sands, LLC, as Borrower, the Guarantors party thereto, the
Lenders party thereto, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent and
Credit Suisse Securities (USA)&nbsp;LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers, amending and
restating the Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of May&nbsp;23, 2007 (as amended on April&nbsp;15,
2009) (the &#147;<U>Existing Credit Agreement</U>&#148;) among Las Vegas Sands, LLC, as Borrower, certain
affiliates of the Borrower as Guarantors, the Lenders party thereto from time to time and the
Agents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), in the form of the Amended and Restated
Credit and Guaranty Agreement attached to the Amendment Agreement (the Existing Credit Agreement,
as so amended and restated, the &#147;<U>Restated Credit Agreement</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms used in
this Certificate and not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in
the Restated Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">I am, and at all pertinent times mentioned herein have been, the duly qualified and acting
chief financial officer of Borrower. In such capacity, I am a senior financial officer of Borrower
and I have participated actively in the management of its financial affairs and am familiar with
its financial statements and those of its Subsidiaries. I am familiar with the terms and
conditions of the Restated Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">I have carefully reviewed the contents of this Certificate, and I have conferred with counsel
for Borrower for the purpose of discussing the meaning of its contents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-left: 8%">I have carefully reviewed the Restated Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">In connection with preparing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Amendment Agreement and the Restated Credit Agreement (the &#147;<B>Proposed Transactions</B>&#148;), I have
participated in the preparation of, and I have reviewed, projections of net income and cash flows
for the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for fiscal years 2010-2016 (the &#147;<B>Projected
Financial Statements</B>&#148;). The Projected Financial Statements, attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U>,
give effect to the consummation of the Proposed Transactions and assume that the debt obligations
of the Borrower will be paid from the cash flow generated by the operations of the Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including certain asset sales) and from refinancing sources. The
Projected Financial Statements were prepared on the basis of information available at June&nbsp;30,
2010. I know of no facts that have occurred since such date that would lead me to believe that the
assumptions upon which the Projected Financial Statements are based are inaccurate in any material
respect. The Projected Financial
Statements do not reflect (i)&nbsp;any potential material, adverse changes in general business
conditions, or (ii)&nbsp;any potential changes in income tax laws.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin-left: .25in; width: 7.50in">

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">In connection with the preparation of the Projected Financial Statements, I have made such
investigations and inquiries as I have deemed necessary and prudent therefor and, specifically,
have relied on historical information with respect to revenues, expenses and other relevant items
supplied by the supervisory personnel of Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries directly
responsible for the various operations involved. The assumptions upon which the Projected
Financial Statements are based are stated therein. Although any assumptions and any projections by
necessity involve uncertainties and approximations, I believe, based on my discussions with other
members of management, that the assumptions on which the Projected Financial Statements are based
are reasonable. Based thereon, I believe that the projections for Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, reflected in the Projected Financial Statements provide reasonable
estimations of future performance, subject, as stated above, to the uncertainties and
approximations inherent in any projections.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">Based on the foregoing, as of the date hereof, on behalf of the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, I have reached the following conclusions:
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-left: 4%; text-indent: 4%">Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not now, nor
will the incurrence of the Obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement and the
incurrence of the other obligations contemplated by the Proposed Transactions render
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, &#147;insolvent&#148; as defined
in this paragraph 1. The recipients of this Certificate and I have agreed that, in this
context, &#147;insolvent&#148; means that the present fair salable value of assets is less than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its/their existing debts as
they become absolute and matured. I have assumed that in this context &#147;fair salable value&#148;
means the price available upon the sale of such assets by a willing seller to a willing
buyer, where material information as to the asset and the market for such asset is known to
both, and where the sale is executed with commercially reasonable promptness. We have
agreed that the term &#147;debts&#148; includes any legal liability, whether matured or unmatured,
liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-left: 4%; text-indent: 4%">By the incurrence of the Obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement, and the
incurrence of the other obligations contemplated by the Proposed Transactions, the Borrower
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will not incur debts beyond
its/their ability to pay as such debts mature. I have based my conclusion in part on the
historical financial statements of Borrower, as audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and
the Projected Financial Statements, which demonstrate that Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will have positive cash flow after paying all of
its/their scheduled anticipated indebtedness (including scheduled payments under the
Restated Credit Agreement, the other obligations contemplated by the Proposed Transactions
and other permitted indebtedness). I have concluded that the realization of current assets
in the ordinary course of business will be sufficient to
pay recurring current debt and short-term and long-term debt service as such debts
mature, and that the cash flow (including earnings plus non-cash charges to earnings) will
be sufficient to provide cash necessary to repay the Loans and other Obligations under the
Restated Credit Agreement, the other obligations contemplated by the Proposed Transactions
and other long-term indebtedness as such debt matures.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-left: 4%; text-indent: 4%">The incurrence of the Obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement and the
incurrence of the other obligations contemplated by the Proposed Transactions will not
leave the Borrower with property remaining in its hands constituting &#147;unreasonably small
capital.&#148; In reaching this conclusion, I understand that &#147;unreasonably small capital&#148;
depends upon the nature of the particular business or businesses conducted or to be
conducted, and I have reached my conclusion based on the needs and anticipated needs for
capital of the businesses conducted or anticipated to be conducted by Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in light of the Projected Financial Statements and available credit
capacity.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-left: 4%; text-indent: 4%">To the best of my knowledge, Borrower has not executed the Amendment Agreement or any
documents mentioned therein, or made any transfer or incurred any obligations thereunder,
with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which it is or will become
indebted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">I understand that the Agents and the Lenders are relying on the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing in connection with the extension of credit to Borrower pursuant to the Amendment
Agreement and the Restated Credit Agreement.
