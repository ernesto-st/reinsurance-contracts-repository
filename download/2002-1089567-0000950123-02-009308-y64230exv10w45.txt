Borrowing Notice so long as on such date each of the conditions precedent in

no event shall Borrower deliver more than one (1) Revolving Loan Borrowing

payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by Lender on

on the schedule attached to the Revolving Note or any continuation thereof.

Lender shall be entitled to have the Revolving Note subdivided, by exchange for
Revolving Notes of lesser denominations or otherwise in connection with an
assignment of all or any portion of the Revolving Loan and the Revolving Note
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, that in no event may the
Revolving Note be subdivided into denominations of less than $2,500,000.

SECTION 3. GENERAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWER.

         Borrower represents and warrants to Lender on and as of each Closing
Date as follows:

         3.1 Existence and Power. Borrower is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
and has all corporate powers and material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, the
failure of which to obtain would have a material adverse effect on Borrower's
ability to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the other Facility
Documents to which it is a party. Each Guarantor is an entity in the form set
forth on Schedule 6 hereto duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the state of its


                                       27
<PAGE>
formation, and has all corporate or company powers and all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted and to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement
and the other Facility Documents to which it is a party.

         3.2 Corporate and Governmental Authorization; No Contravention. The
execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of this Agreement and the other
Facility Documents to which it is a party are within Borrower's powers, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or
in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do
not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law
or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Borrower or of
any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding
upon Borrower or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset
of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (except Permitted Liens). The execution,
delivery and performance by each Guarantor of this Agreement and the other
Facility Documents to which it is a party are within such Guarantor's powers,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or company action, require
no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of
applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
articles of organization or operating or company agreement of each Guarantor or
of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument
binding upon each such Guarantor or result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any asset of any Guarantor, or any of their Subsidiaries (except
Permitted Liens).

         3.3 Binding Effect. This Agreement and each of the other Facility
Documents to which it is a party constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
Borrower. This Agreement will vest absolutely and unconditionally in Lender a
valid security interest in the Collateral, subject to no Liens whatsoever
(except for Permitted Liens and as provided pursuant to the Facility Documents).
Upon the filing of the necessary financing statements under the UCC as in effect
in the jurisdiction whose Law governs the perfection of Lender's security
interests in the Collateral, the Lender's security interest in the Collateral
will be perfected under Article 9 of such UCC, prior to and enforceable against
all creditors of and purchasers from Borrower and all other Persons whatsoever
(other than Lender and its successors and assigns). This Agreement and each of
the other Facility Documents to which it is a party constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of each Guarantor.

         3.4 Litigation. Except as is set forth in Schedule 7, there is no
action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of Borrower,
threatened in writing against or affecting Borrower or any Guarantor before any
Official Body in which there is a material likelihood of an adverse decision
which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the business,
financial position or results of operations of Borrower or any Guarantor, or the
ability of Borrower or any Guarantor to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Facility Document to which it is a party or which in any
manner draws into question the validity of this Agreement or any other Facility
Document to which Borrower or any Guarantor is a party.

         3.5 Investment Company. Borrower is not an "investment company" within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


                                       28
<PAGE>
         3.6 Events of Default or Default. No event has occurred, and no
condition exists, that constitutes a Default or an Event of Default.

         3.7 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of each Borrowing and the Loans shall
be used for working capital and school-opening capital and no proceeds of any
Borrowing shall be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether
immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any "margin stock"
within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

         3.8 Accurate and Complete Disclosure. To the knowledge of Borrower and
each Guarantor, all information, exhibits, financial statements, or other
reports or documents furnished or to be furnished at any time by or on behalf of
Borrower or any Guarantor to Lender in connection with this Agreement or any
other Facility Document is and will be accurate in all material respects as of
the date so furnished, and no such report or document contains, or will contain,
as of the date so furnished, any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state, or will omit to state, as of the date so furnished, a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         3.9 Taxes. Borrower and each Guarantor has filed, or caused to be
filed, all federal and state, and to the best of its knowledge, all local and
foreign, tax reports and returns, if any, required to be filed by it and paid,
or caused to be paid, all amounts of taxes, including interest and penalties,
required to be paid by it, except for such taxes (i) as are being contested in
good faith by proper proceedings and (ii) against which adequate reserves shall
have been established in accordance with and to the extent required by GAAP, but
only so long as the proceedings referred to in clause (i) above could not
subject Borrower, any Guarantor, or Lender to any civil or criminal penalty or
liability or involve any material risk of the loss, sale or forfeiture of any
property, rights or interests covered hereunder.

         3.10 Books and Records. Borrower has indicated on its books and records
(including any computer files) that the Receivables have been assigned by
Borrower hereunder to Lender. Borrower maintains at one or more of its
respective offices listed in Schedule 8 hereto all material Records for the
Receivables and Owned Real Estate.

         3.11 Financial Condition. (a) None of Borrower or any Guarantor is the
subject of any Event of Bankruptcy and the assignment of Receivables on such day
is not being made in contemplation of the occurrence thereof. Except as
previously disclosed to Lender, since May 15, 2002 there has been no material
adverse change in the business or financial position of Borrower which would be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on Borrower's ability to
fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or any other Facility Document to
which it is a party. Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor is contemplating either
the filing of a petition by it under state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency
laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of its assets or property, and
Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such
petition against it or any Guarantor.

         Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year then ended, audited by
         PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, independent accountants, or another
         nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, copies of which
         have been furnished to Lender, fairly present in all material respects
         the consolidated financial position of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as
         of such date and the consolidated results of the operations of and

         balance sheet of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the most recent
         fiscal quarter end and the related un-audited statements of income and

         operations of and changes in consolidated cash flows of Borrower and
         its Subsidiaries for the periods ended on such date subject to
         customary year-end adjustments, all in accordance with GAAP.

         3.12 Insurance. All policies of insurance of any kind or nature owned
by Borrower and its Subsidiaries are, to Borrower's knowledge, maintained with
financially sound and reputable insurers. Borrower currently maintains insurance
with respect to its properties and businesses and causes its Subsidiaries to
maintain insurance with respect to their properties and business against loss or
damage of the kinds customarily insured against by corporations engaged in the
same or similar business and similarly situated, of such types and in such
amounts as are customarily carried under similar circumstances by such other
corporations including, without limitation, workers' compensation and general
liability insurance.

         3.13 ERISA. (a) No liability under Sections 4062, 4063, 4064 or 4069 of
ERISA has been or is expected by Borrower to be incurred by Borrower or any
ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Plan which is a Single-Employer Plan in an
amount that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, financial condition, operations or properties of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         (b) No Plan which is a Single-Employer Plan and which is maintained by
Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates had an accumulated funding deficiency in
an amount that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, financial condition, operations or properties of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of such Plan ended prior to the date hereof. Neither
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate is (A) required to give security to any Plan
which is a Single-Employer Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or
Section 307 of ERISA, or (B) subject to a Lien in favor of such a Plan under
Section 302(f) of ERISA.

         (c) Each Plan of Borrower and each of its ERISA Affiliates is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and
the Code, except where the


                                       30
<PAGE>
failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to result in any material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operations or properties of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         (d) Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred a tax
liability under Section 4975 of the Code or a penalty under Section 502(i) of
ERISA in respect of any Plan which has not been paid in full, except where the
incurrence of such tax or penalty could not reasonably be expected to result in
a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operations or
properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         (e) None of Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any liability under Section 4201 of
ERISA as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan
which will result in liability to Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate in an amount that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operations or properties of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         3.14 Owned Real Estate Taxes and Assessments. The Owned Real Estate is
comprised of more than one parcel, each of which constitutes a separate tax lot
and none of which constitutes a portion of any other tax lot. There are no
pending or, to Borrower's knowledge, proposed, special or other assessments for
public improvements or otherwise affecting the Owned Real Estate, nor are there
any contemplated improvements to the Owned Real Estate that may result in such
special or other assessments.

         3.15 Other Agreements; Defaults. Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor are
a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any court order,
injunction, permit, or restriction which might adversely affect the business,
operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower or any Guarantor.
Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor are in violation of any agreement which
violation would have a material adverse effect on Borrower's or any Guarantor's
ability to perform its obligations hereunder or Borrower's, or any Guarantor's
business, properties, or assets, operations or condition, financial or
otherwise.

         3.16 Compliance with Law. (a) Except with respect to the Trenton House
and the Trenton Parking Lot, to Borrower's knowledge, Borrower and each
Guarantor, as the case may be, have all requisite licenses, permits, franchises,
qualifications, certificates of occupancy or other governmental authorizations
to own, lease and operate the Owned Real Estate and carry on its business, and
the Owned Real Estate is in compliance with all applicable legal requirements in
all material respects and all building systems contained therein are in good
working order, subject to ordinary wear and tear and except as disclosed in
building condition reports and other documentation delivered to Lender on or
prior to the date hereof; and

         (b) No condemnation has been commenced or, to Borrower's knowledge, is
contemplated with respect to all or any portion of the Owned Real Estate or for
the relocation of roadways providing access to the Owned Real Estate.

         3.17 Solvency. Giving effect to the Loans, the fair saleable value of
Borrower's assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of the
Loans, exceed Borrower's total


                                       31
<PAGE>
liabilities, including, without limitation, subordinated, un-liquidated,
disputed and contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of Borrower's
assets is and will, immediately following the making of the Loans, be greater
than Borrower's probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its
contingent liabilities on their Debts as such Debts become absolute and matured.
Borrower's assets do not and, immediately following the making of the Loans will
not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as
conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to, and does
not believe that it will, incur Debts and liabilities (including contingent
liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such Debts as they
mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by
Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of
Borrower).

         3.18 Owned Real Estate Insurance. Borrower has obtained and has
delivered to Lender a certificate of insurance for the Owned Real Estate
reflecting the insurance coverages, amounts and other insurance requirements set
forth in this Agreement. No claims have been made under any such policy which
would have a material adverse effect on Borrower's ability to perform its
obligations hereunder, and no Person, including Borrower, has done, by act or
omission, anything which would impair the coverage of any such policy.

         3.19 Equipment.

         (a) The Borrower owns the Equipment set forth on Schedule 9 hereto.

         (b) Borrower will keep the Equipment at such locations in the
continental United States as Borrower may elect, provided that (i) all action
has been taken to grant to Lender a perfected, first priority security interest
in such Equipment (subject only to Permitted Liens), and (ii) Lender's rights in
such Equipment, including, without limitation, the existence, perfection and
priority of the security interest created hereby in such Equipment, are not
adversely affected.

         (c) Borrower will maintain or cause the Equipment to be maintained and
preserved in good condition, repair and working order as when acquired and in
accordance with any manufacturer's manual, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and
will forthwith, or in the case of any loss or damage to any Equipment as quickly
as practicable after the occurrence thereof, make or cause to be made all
repairs, replacements and other improvements in connection therewith which are
necessary or desirable, consistent with past practice, or which Lender may
request to such end. Borrower will promptly furnish to Lender a statement
describing in reasonable detail any material loss or damage to any Equipment.

         3.20 SEC Documents. The Borrower has filed all required reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all
other information incorporated therein) with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 2001 (the "Borrower SEC Documents").
Except to the extent that information contained in any Borrower SEC Documents
has been revised or superseded by a later filed Borrower SEC Document: (i) as of
their respective dates, the Borrower SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Borrower SEC Documents, and none of the Borrower SEC Documents when filed
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state


                                       32
<PAGE>
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading; (ii) none of the Borrower SEC Documents contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (iii) the
financial statements of the Borrower included in the Borrower SEC Documents
comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal recurring year-end audit adjustments).

SECTION 3A. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWER RELATING TO
            COLLATERAL.

         Borrower represents and warrants to Lender on and as of each Closing
Date:

         3A.1 Place of Business; Records Location; Etc. The address of the chief
executive office of Borrower is 521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York or, if
Borrower relocates its chief executive office in accordance with Section 10.8
hereof, such other address as Borrower shall have notified Lender in accordance
with such Section. Borrower keeps all of its Records at the offices listed on
Schedule 8 attached hereto. Borrower is a "registered organization" (as defined
in Section 9-102(a)(70) of the UCC) formed in the State of Delaware and, for
purposes of Article 9 of the UCC, Borrower is located in the State of Delaware.
Borrower's name is "Edison Schools Inc." and Borrower has not changed its name,
merged or consolidated with any other Person, except as set forth on Schedule 10
attached hereto.

         3A.2 No Liens. Each Receivable, the Related Security, the Collections,
Owned Real Estate, all Equipment and all other Collateral, is owned by Borrower
free and clear of any Lien (except Permitted Liens). Lender has a first priority
perfected security interest in the Collateral free and clear of any Lien (except
Permitted Liens). Borrower has not and will not sell, pledge, assign, transfer
or subject to a Lien any of the Receivables, the Related Security, the
Collections, the Equipment, all other Collateral or the Owned Real Estate, other
than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         3A.3 No Adverse Actions. Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor have
performed any acts which would prevent Lender from enforcing any of the terms of
this Agreement or any Facility Document or which would limit Lender in any such
enforcement. Other than financing statements or other similar or equivalent
documents or instruments with respect to the Security Interests and Permitted
Liens, no financing statement, mortgage, security agreement or similar or
equivalent document or instrument covering all or any part of the Collateral is
on file or of record in any jurisdiction in which such filing or recording would
be effective to perfect a Lien on such Collateral.


                                       33
<PAGE>
         3A.4 Filings. The Security Interests constitute valid security
interests under the UCC securing the Obligations. On or before the initial
Closing Date, all UCC financing statements and other documents required to be
recorded or filed in order to perfect and protect the Security Interests against
all creditors of and purchasers from Borrower and all other Persons whatsoever
shall have been duly filed (or shall have been delivered to Lender for filing)
in each filing office necessary for such purpose and all filing fees and taxes,
if any, payable in connection with such filings shall have been paid.

         3A.5 Notice. In the case of a Closing Date, all information set forth
on the related Term Loan Borrowing Notice, Revolving Loan Borrowing Notice, and
Borrowing Base Report is true and correct in all material respects as of such
Closing Date.

         3A.6 Assignment. This Agreement constitutes a valid pledge by Borrower,
in favor of Lender, of the Collateral, and a valid assignment by Borrower, to
Lender of the Receivables, in each case enforceable against all creditors of and
purchasers from Borrower.

         3A.7 Owned Real Estate Title. To Borrower's knowledge, Borrower and
each Guarantor has good and insurable title to the applicable Owned Real Estate,
free and clear of all Liens whatsoever, except for the Permitted Liens and such
other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Facility Documents. The Mortgages
create (and upon the recordation thereof and of any related financing statements
there will be perfected):

                  (i) a valid Lien on the Owned Real Estate, subject only to
         Permitted Liens; and

                  (ii) security interests in and to, and collateral assignments
         of, all personalty (including the leases), all in accordance with the
         terms thereof, in each case subject only to any Permitted Liens and
         such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Facility Documents.
         To Borrower's knowledge, there are no claims for payment for work,
         labor or materials affecting the Owned Real Estate which would have a
         material adverse effect on Borrower's or any Guarantor's ability to
         perform its obligations hereunder or under any other Facility Document.
         None of the Permitted Liens, individually or in the aggregate,
         materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be
         provided by the Mortgages and this Agreement, materially and adversely
         affect the value of the Owned Real Estate, materially impair the use or
         operations of the Owned Real Estate or impair Borrower's ability to pay
         its obligations in a timely manner.

         3A.8 Flood Zone. Except as otherwise shown on the survey delivered to
Lender in connection with the initial advance of the Loans, to Borrower's
knowledge, no portion of the improvements comprising the Owned Real Estate is

<PAGE>
"Licenses") have been obtained and are in full force and effect. Borrower shall

Borrower's knowledge, there exists no structural or other material defects or
damages in the Owned Real Estate, whether latent or otherwise, and Borrower has
not received written notice from any insurance company or bonding company of any
defects or inadequacies in the Owned Real Estate, or any part thereof, which

SECTION 4. INSURANCE AND CONDEMNATION.

         4.1 Owned Real Estate Insurance. Borrower shall maintain insurance as
follows:

         (a) Casualty; Business Interruption. Borrower shall keep the Owned Real
Estate insured against damage by fire and the other hazards covered by a
standard extended coverage and all-risk insurance policy for the full insurable
value thereof (without reduction for depreciation or co-insurance), and shall
maintain such other casualty insurance as reasonably required by Lender,
including building ordinance insurance and insurance for acts of terrorism.
Borrower shall keep the Owned Real Estate insured against loss by flood if the
Owned Real Estate is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood
insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of
1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or the National Flood Insurance
Reform Act of 1994 (as each such act may be amended or succeeded), in an amount
at least equal to the lesser of:

                  (i) the maximum amount of the Loans; or

                  (ii) the maximum limit of coverage available under said act.


                                       35
<PAGE>
         Borrower shall maintain use and occupancy insurance covering, as
applicable, rental income or business interruption, with coverage in an amount
not less than twelve (12) months anticipated gross rental income or gross
business earnings, as applicable in each case, attributable to the Owned Real
Estate. Borrower shall not maintain any separate or additional insurance which
is contributing in the event of loss unless it is properly endorsed and
otherwise satisfactory to Lender in all respects. The proceeds of insurance paid
on account of any damage or destruction to the Owned Real Estate shall be paid
to Lender to be applied as provided in Section 4.2.

         (b) Liability. Borrower shall maintain:

                  (i) commercial general liability insurance with respect to the
         Owned Real Estate providing for limits of liability of not less than
         $5,000,000 for both injury to or death of a person and for property
         damage per occurrence; and

                  (ii) other liability insurance as reasonably required by
         Lender.

         (c) Form and Quality. All insurance policies shall be endorsed in form
and substance acceptable to Lender to name Lender as an additional insured, loss
payee or mortgagee thereunder, as its interest may appear, with loss payable to
Lender, without contribution, under a standard New York (or local equivalent)
mortgagee clause. All such insurance policies and endorsements shall be fully
paid for and contain such provisions and expiration dates and be in such form
and issued by such insurance companies licensed to do business in the State of
New York, with a rating of "A-X" or better as established by Best's Rating Guide
or "AA" as established by Standard & Poor's. Each policy shall provide that such
policy may not be cancelled or materially changed except upon thirty (30) days'
prior written notice of intention of non-renewal, cancellation or material
change to Lender and that no act or thing done by Borrower shall invalidate any
policy as against Lender. Blanket policies will be permitted provided Lender
receives appropriate endorsements and/or duplicate policies confirming Lender's
right to continue coverage on a pro rata pass-through basis and that coverage
will not be affected by loss on other properties. If Borrower fails to maintain
insurance in compliance with this Section, Lender may obtain such insurance and
pay the premium therefor and Borrower shall, on demand, reimburse Lender for all
expenses incurred in connection therewith. Borrower shall assign the policies or
proofs of insurance to Lender, in such manner and form that Lender and its
successors and assigns shall at all times have and hold the same as security for
the payment of the Loans. Borrower shall deliver copies of all original policies
certified to Lender by the insurance company or authorized agent as being true
copies, together with the endorsements required hereunder. The proceeds of
insurance policies coming into the possession of Lender shall not be deemed
trust funds, and Lender shall be entitled to apply such proceeds as herein
provided.

         (d) Adjustments. Borrower shall give immediate written notice of any
loss to the insurance carrier and to Lender. Borrower and each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably authorize and empower Lender, as attorney in fact for Borrower
coupled with an interest, to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any
claim under insurance policies, to


                                       36
<PAGE>
appear in and prosecute any action arising from such insurance policies, to
collect and receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct therefrom Lender's
expenses incurred in the collection of such proceeds. Nothing contained in this
Section, however, shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action
hereunder.

         4.2 Use and Application of Insurance Proceeds. Lender shall apply
insurance proceeds to costs of restoring the Owned Real Estate or the Loans as
follows:

         (a) if the loss is less than or equal to $250,000, Lender shall apply
the insurance proceeds to restoration provided:

                  (i) no Event of Default or Default exists; and

                  (ii) Borrower promptly commences and is diligently pursuing
         restoration of the Owned Real Estate;

         (b) if the loss exceeds $250,000 but is not more than 20% of the
replacement value of the improvements (for projects containing multiple phases
or stand alone structures, such calculation to be based on the damaged phase or
structure, not the project as a whole), Lender shall apply the insurance
proceeds to restoration provided that at all times during such restoration:

                  (i) no Event of Default or Default exists;

                  (ii) Borrower promptly commences and is diligently pursuing
         restoration of the Owned Real Estate;

         (c) if the conditions set forth above are not satisfied or the loss
exceeds the maximum amount specified in Subsection 4.2(b) above, in Lender's
sole discretion, Lender may apply any insurance proceeds it may receive to the
payment of the Loans or allow all or a portion of such proceeds to be used for
the restoration of the Owned Real Estate; and

         (d) insurance proceeds applied to restoration will be disbursed on
receipt of satisfactory plans and specifications, contracts and subcontracts,
schedules, budgets, lien waivers and architects' certificates, and otherwise in
accordance with prudent commercial construction lending practices for
construction loan advances.

         4.3 Condemnation Awards. Borrower shall immediately notify Lender of
the institution of any proceeding for the condemnation or other taking of the
Owned Real Estate or any portion thereof. Lender may participate in any such
proceeding and Borrower will deliver to Lender all instruments necessary or
required by Lender to permit such participation. Without Lender's prior consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Borrower:

         (a) shall not agree to any compensation or award; and

         (b) shall not take any action or fail to take any action which would
cause the compensation to be determined. All awards and compensation for the
taking or purchase


                                       37
<PAGE>
in lieu of condemnation of the Owned Real Estate or any part thereof are hereby
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender. Borrower and each Guarantor authorize
Lender to collect and receive such awards and compensation and to give proper
receipts and acquittances therefore, and in the Lender's sole discretion to
apply the same toward the payment of the Loans, notwithstanding that the Loans
may not then be due and payable, or to the restoration of the Owned Real Estate.
Borrower, upon request by Lender, shall execute all instruments requested to
confirm the assignment of the awards and compensation to Lender, free and clear
of all liens, charges or encumbrances.

SECTION 5. LEASING COVENANTS.

         5.1 Covenants. Except with respect to the Trenton House and Trenton
Parking Lot under clause (b) and (d) below, Borrower and each Guarantor, with
respect to all leases of the Owned Real Estate:

         (a) shall perform the obligations which Borrower or such Guarantor, as
landlord, is required to perform under the leases;

         (b) shall enforce the obligations to be performed by the tenants;

         (c) shall promptly furnish to Lender any notice of default or
termination received by Borrower or any Guarantor from any tenant, and any
notice of default or termination given by Borrower or any Guarantor to any
tenant;

         (d) shall not collect any rents for more than thirty (30) days in
advance of the time when the same shall become due, except for bona fide
security deposits not in excess of an amount equal to two months rent;

         (e) shall not enter into any ground lease or master lease of any part
of the Owned Real Estate;

         (f) shall not further assign or encumber any lease;

         (g) shall not, except with Lender's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), cancel or accept
surrender or termination of any lease; and

         (h) shall not, except with Lender's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), modify or amend any
lease (except for minor modifications and amendments entered into in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with prudent property management
practices, not affecting the economic terms of the lease), and any action in
violation of clauses (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this Section shall be void at the
election of Lender.

Borrower's knowledge, except as set forth in any environmental report delivered
to Lender prior to the Closing Date:

installed, disposed of or otherwise present at or about the Owned Real Estate

routine maintenance or repair of the Owned Real Estate in full compliance with
Environmental Laws);

         (b) all permits, licenses, approvals and filings required by
Environmental Laws have been obtained, and the use, operation and condition of

         (c) no civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, claim, hearing,
investigation or proceeding has been brought or been threatened while the Owned
Real Estate was owned by Borrower or its wholly owned Subsidiary, nor have any
settlements been reached by or with any parties or any liens imposed in
connection with the Owned Real Estate concerning Hazardous Materials or
Environmental Laws while the Owned Real Estate was owned by Borrower or its
wholly owned Subsidiary.

         5A.2 Covenants on Environmental Matters.

         (a) Borrower and each Guarantor shall:

                  (i) comply in all respects with applicable Environmental Laws
         with respect to the Owned Real Estate;

                  (ii) notify Lender immediately upon Borrower's and/or any
         Guarantor's discovery of any spill, discharge, release or presence of
         any Hazardous Material at, upon, under, within, contiguous to or
         otherwise affecting the Owned Real Estate;

                  (iii) promptly remove such Hazardous Materials and remediate
         the Owned Real Estate in full compliance with Environmental Laws or as

         and

                  (iv) promptly forward to Lender copies of all orders, notices,
         permits, applications or other communications and reports in connection
         with any spill, discharge, release or the presence of any Hazardous
         Material or any other matters relating to the Environmental Laws or any
         similar laws or regulations, as they may affect the Owned Real Estate,
         or Borrower or any Guarantor.

         (b) Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor shall cause, shall prohibit any
other Person within the control of Borrower or any Guarantor from causing, and
Borrower and each Guarantor shall use prudent, commercially reasonable efforts
to prohibit other Persons (including tenants) from:


                                       39
<PAGE>
                  (i) causing any spill, discharge or release, or the use,
         storage, generation, manufacture, installation, or disposal, of any
         Hazardous Materials at, upon, under, within or about the Owned Real
         Estate or the transportation of any Hazardous Materials to or from the
         Owned Real Estate (except for cleaning and other products used in

         in full compliance with Environmental Laws);

                  (ii) installing any underground storage tanks at the Owned

         (b) Borrower shall provide to Lender, at Borrower's expense promptly

required by Lender, an update to any existing Site Assessment, to assess the
presence or absence of any Hazardous Materials and the potential costs in
connection with abatement, cleanup or removal of any Hazardous Materials found
on, under, at or within the Owned Real Estate. Borrower shall pay the cost of no
more than one such Site Assessment or update in any twelve (12) month period,
unless Lender's request for a Site Assessment is based on information provided
under Section 5A.2(a), a reasonable suspicion of Hazardous Materials at or near
the Owned Real Estate, a breach of representations under Section 5A.1, or an
Event of Default, in which case any such Site Assessment or update shall be at
Borrower's expense.

         5A.3 Allocation of Risks and Indemnity. As between Borrower and each
Guarantor and Lender, all risk of loss associated with non-compliance with
Environmental Laws, or with the presence of any Hazardous Material at, upon,
within, contiguous to or otherwise affecting the Owned Real Estate, shall lie
solely with Borrower and each Guarantor unless caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Lender. Accordingly, Borrower and each Guarantor shall
bear all risks and costs associated with any loss (including any loss in value
attributable to Hazardous Materials), damage or liability therefrom unless
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender, including all
costs of removal of Hazardous Materials or other remediation required by law.
Borrower and each Guarantor shall indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless
from and against all loss, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses
(including reasonable costs of defense) arising out of or associated, in any
way, with the non-compliance with Environmental Laws, or the existence of
Hazardous Materials in, on, or about the Owned Real Estate, or a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Article, whether based in
contract, tort, implied or express warranty, strict liability, criminal or civil
statute or common law, including those arising from the joint, concurrent, or
comparative negligence of Lender; however, Borrower and each Guarantor shall not
be liable under such indemnification to the extent such loss, liability, damage,
claim, cost or expense results solely from Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Borrower's and each Guarantor's obligations under this Section shall
arise upon the discovery of the presence of any Hazardous Material, whether or
not any governmental authority has taken or threatened any action in connection
with the presence of any Hazardous Material, and whether or not the existence of
any such Hazardous Material or potential liability on account thereof is
disclosed in the Site Assessment and shall continue notwithstanding the
repayment of the Loans or any transfer or


                                       40
<PAGE>
sale of any right, title and interest in the Owned Real Estate (by foreclosure,
deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise)

         5A.4. No Waiver. Notwithstanding any provision in this Article or
elsewhere in the Documents, or any rights or remedies granted by the Facility
Documents, Lender does not waive and expressly reserves all rights and benefits
now or hereafter accruing to Lender under the "security interest" or "secured
creditor" exception under applicable Environmental Laws, as the same may be
amended. No action taken by Lender pursuant to the Facility Documents shall be
deemed or construed to be a waiver or relinquishment of any such rights or
benefits under the "security interest exception."

SECTION 7. CONDITIONS TO LENDER'S OBLIGATION TO FUND BORROWING REQUESTS
           (INCLUDING THE INITIAL BORROWING REQUEST) AND TO MAINTAIN THE LOANS.

         Lender's obligation to fund any Borrowing request hereunder (including
the initial Borrowing request) shall be subject to the satisfaction, prior to
the funding of such Borrowing of the following conditions:

         7.1 Representations True; No Default or Event of Default.

         The representations and warranties of Borrower contained in Sections 3,
3A, 5 and 5A shall be true in all material respects on and as of such Closing
Date with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of such Closing Date. There shall exist on such Closing Date no
Default or Event of Default (both before and after giving effect to the
Borrowing requested on such Closing Date); provided, however, in the event there
is a claim by any third party, on or prior to the Second Closing Date, that such
third party holds the original promissory note(s) or owns any of, or has a
perfected security interest in, the loans set forth on Schedule 19 attached
hereto, such claim shall not be deemed to be a Default or Event of Default
hereunder and Lender shall fully fund the Revolver Loan and the Term Loan in
accordance with the terms of Sections 2 and 6 hereof on the Second Closing Date.

         7.2 Borrowing Base. In the case of a Closing Date, after giving effect
to the Borrowing on such Closing Date, the repayment (if any) of the Loans on
such Closing Date, the inclusion of additional Eligible Receivables and Eligible
Owned Real Estate in the Borrowing Base on such Closing Date and the exclusion
from the Borrowing Base of Receivables and Owned Real Estate (if any) which no
longer constitute Eligible Receivables or Eligible Owned Real Estate (or as to
which there have been Collections) on such Closing Date, the aggregate principal
balance of the Revolving Loan shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the Revolving
Loan Commitment on such Closing Date and (y) the Borrowing Base on such Closing
Date. Such calculation shall be evidenced by the applicable Borrowing Base
Report delivered to Lender on the third Business Day preceding such Closing Date
calculated as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
the date of delivery.

financial condition of Borrower or any Guarantor which would have, in Lender's
reasonable judgment, a material adverse effect on Borrower's or any Guarantor's
ability to perform its obligations under the Facility Documents.

proceeding shall have occurred or shall have been threatened against the Owned
Real Estate; which would have a material adverse effect on Borrower's ability to
perform its obligations hereunder; the Owned Real Estate shall not have suffered
any damage by fire or other casualty which has not been repaired or is not being
restored in accordance with this Agreement; no Law, moratorium, injunctive
proceeding, restriction, litigation, action, citation or similar proceeding or
matter shall have been enacted, adopted, or threatened by any governmental
authority, which would have, a material adverse effect on Borrower's ability to
perform its obligations under the Facility Documents.

         7.8 Security. Such advance shall be secured by the applicable Facility
Documents, subject only to Permitted Liens.

SECTION 8. LOAN MATURITY; LOAN PREPAYMENTS.

         8.1 Loan Maturity. On the Maturity Date (or, if different, the
Expiration Date), the full principal amount of the Revolving Loan and Term Loan,
together with accrued Interest thereon and any other amounts due hereunder,
shall be due and payable in full.

         8.2 Mandatory Prepayments. (a) Unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, Borrower, shall, without notice, immediately prepay
the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan, without premium, together with Interest
accrued on the amount to be prepaid to the date of prepayment, on any date on
which the aggregate principal balance of the Revolving Loan and Term Loan on
such date exceeds the sum of (i) the Borrowing Base on such date, and (ii) if
the Harlem Real Estate has not been sold or refinanced, $7,000,000, such
prepayment to be in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess and to be
applied first to the Revolving Loan and then to the Term Loan. Upon the
occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower will make payments
on the Loans in accordance with Sections 12 and 14 hereof. If Lender receives a
payment on or with respect to any Receivable, the proceeds of such Receivable
shall be used to prepay the Revolving Loan, and any excess funds shall be used
to prepay the Term Loan.


                                       46
<PAGE>
         (b) Subject to Section 10.18(a) and notwithstanding the foregoing and
any other provision hereunder or in any other Facility Document to the contrary,
in the event any of Borrower or any Guarantor shall sell, transfer or mortgage
any of the Owned Real Estate in accordance with Section 10.18(a) hereof, (a)
100% of the net proceeds of such sale, transfer or mortgage of such Owned Real
Estate (other than the Harlem Real Estate) shall be paid to Lender and applied
as a prepayment of the Revolving Loan and Term Loan, and, in connection
therewith, (i) Lender shall release the lien of the mortgage on such Owned Real
Estate and execute any and all documents, termination agreements and instruments
required to release the lien of the Mortgage and any other Collateral associated
with such Owned Real Estate, and (ii) all of the terms, conditions and
provisions hereunder and under the other Facility Documents with respect to such
Owned Real Estate shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and
effect, and (b) 100% of the net proceeds of such sale, transfer or mortgage of
the Harlem Real Estate shall be paid to Lender and applied as a prepayment of
the Term Loan, and, in connection therewith, (i) Lender shall release the lien
of the Mortgage on the Harlem Real Estate and execute any and all documents,
termination agreements and instruments required to release the lien of the
Mortgage and any other Collateral associated with the Harlem Real Estate, and
(ii) all of the terms, conditions and provisions hereunder and under the other
Facility Documents with respect to the Harlem Real Estate shall automatically
terminate and be of no further force and effect.

         (c) On the date on which the Borrower terminates the Revolving Loan
Commitment in accordance with Section 2.5(b), the Borrower shall repay the
Obligations in full.

         (d) In the event that the Revolving Loan Commitment shall be reduced
for any reason below the amount of the outstanding principal balance of the
Revolving Loan, on the date of such reduction Borrower shall pay to Lender, as a
prepayment of the Revolving Loan, the amount of such excess.

         (e) In the event that any Receivable is refinanced in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, Borrower shall pay to Lender an amount equal to the
net cash proceeds received by Borrower in connection with such refinancing,
which amount shall be used to prepay the Revolving Loan (and the Revolving Loan
Commitment shall then be reduced in accordance with the terms of Section 2.7
hereof); provided, however, in the event that the amount of such net cash
proceeds is greater than the then outstanding balance of the Revolving Loan,
Borrower shall pay to Lender from such net cash proceeds an amount equal to the
then outstanding balance of the Revolving Loan (and the Revolving Loan
Commitment shall then be reduced in accordance with the terms of Section 2.7
hereof) and if, at the time that such payments are required, the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1, 7.6 and 7.7 are satisfied, Borrower shall have the right
to retain the excess(otherwise such excess shall be paid to Lender as a
prepayment of the Term Loan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
the permanent reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitment required under Section
2.7 in connection with any such refinancing of a Receivable would reduce the
Revolving Loan Commitment below zero, then (i) Borrower shall prepay the
Revolving Loan in full, (ii) Borrower shall prepay the Term Loan in an amount
equal to the amount by which the Revolving Loan Commitment would be reduced
below zero, and (iii) if, at the time that such payments are required, the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1, 7.6 and 7.7 are satisfied, Borrower shall
have the right to retain amounts in excess


                                       47
<PAGE>
of what is required to be paid under the preceding clauses (i) and (ii)
(otherwise such excess shall be paid to Lender as a prepayment of the Term
Loan).

         (f) Following the occurrence of an Event of Default, in the event that
ERC distributes, dividends, contributes, or otherwise pays any sum of money to
Borrower other than pursuant to the Purchase and Contribution Agreement,
Borrower shall, within two (2) days of receipt of such amounts, pay to Lender
such amounts, which amounts shall be used to prepay the Revolving Loan and then
the Term Loan.

         8.3 Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower may at any time voluntarily prepay
all or a portion of the Revolving Loan without premium or penalty. The Borrower
may at any time voluntarily prepay all or a portion of the Term Loan without
premium or penalty.

         8.4 Allocation of Prepayments. The aggregate principal amount of any

allocated, first, to any fees and expenses due to Lender under the Facility
Documents; second, to any Default Rate interest or late charges; third, to
accrued and unpaid interest; fourth, to the principal sum and other amounts due
under the Revolving Loan; and fifth to Term Loan applied as set forth in the
immediately succeeding sentence; provided, however, that Lender may apply such
payments in any order or manner during the continuance of an Event of Default.
The aggregate principal amount of any prepayment of the Term Loan pursuant to
Section 8.2 or 8.3 shall be allocated, first, to any fees and expenses due to
Lender under the Facility Documents; second, to any Default Rate interest or
late charges; third, to accrued and unpaid interest; and fourth, to the
principal sum of the Term Loan and other amounts due under the Facility
Documents; provided, however, that Lender may apply such payments in any order
or manner during the continuance of an Event of Default.

         8.5 Prepayment Notice. Borrower shall provide written notice to Lender
of any voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loan as early as practicable prior
to the date for such prepayment, but in no event later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the date for such prepayment. Borrower shall provide written
notice to Lender of any voluntary prepayment of the Term Loan as early as
practicable prior to the date for such prepayment, but in no event later than

permitted to be made on the Revolving Loan, the Term Loan, the Revolving Note,
the Term Note or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement
(including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 2 or this Section 8) shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Lender's account
designated on the signature page hereto and, in the case of any such mandatory
payments or prepayments, such payments or prepayments shall be due by 1:00 p.m.
(New York City time).

SECTION 9. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

         9.1 Assignments. Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations
hereunder or under the Revolving Note or Term Note.

Lender may (subject in all events to the confidentiality provisions of Section
17.2) assign all or any portion of the Commitments, the Revolving Loan, and the
Term Loan:


                                       48
<PAGE>
            (a) to any (i) wholly-owned subsidiary of Lender, or (ii) Affiliate
      of Lender in which Lender owns an equity interest of at least 51%, in each
      case without Borrower's prior written consent; and

            (b) to any bank or other institution (each such Affiliate, bank or
      other institution, an "Assignee") with, so long as no Event of Default has
      occurred and is continuing, the prior written consent of Borrower not to
      be unreasonably withheld; provided that any assignment of a portion of the
      Revolving Loan or the Term Loan shall be in an amount not less than
      $2,500,000. The Assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment
      (unless otherwise provided in such assignment), the obligations, rights
      and benefits of Lender hereunder with respect to the portion of the
      Revolving Loan and/or Term Loan assigned to it. For all purposes of this
      Agreement, the Assignee shall, so long as the portion of the Revolving
      Loan and/or Term Loan assigned to such Assignee remain unpaid, be entitled
      to the rights and benefits of this Agreement with respect to the portion
      of the Revolving Loan and/or Term Loan assigned to it as if (and, Borrower
      shall be directly obligated to such Assignee under this Agreement as if)
      such Assignee were the "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement.
      Accordingly, unless otherwise provided, whenever any action, waiver,
      notice or consent is to be provided to or by Lender as herein specified,
      such action, waiver, notice or consent shall (unless otherwise expressly
      specified herein) also be provided to or by each Assignee. If the
      Revolving Loan and/or Term Loan are assigned in their entirety, the
      Assignee shall become Lender hereunder, Borrower shall have no further
      obligation to the assigning Lender, and the assigning Lender shall have no
      further obligation to Borrower.

            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.1, no
      assignment of an interest in the Revolving Loan or Term Loan to an entity
      outside the United States of America shall be effective unless the
      prospective Assignee thereof certifies to Borrower that payments to it in
      respect of such Loan will not be subject to withholding taxes imposed by
      any Official Body in the United States of America or any political
      subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or that if it is
      subject to such withholding taxes it will not seek reimbursement or
      gross-up from Borrower.

      If School Services LLC, the initial Lender, assigns a portion of the
      Revolving Loan Commitment or Term Loan Commitment or its rights in the
      Revolving Loan or Revolving Note or Term Loan or Term Note to multiple
      lenders, then Borrower agrees to cooperate with School Services LLC in
      amending this Agreement so as to provide that School Services LLC will act
      as agent for all of such lenders.

      9.2 Participations. Subject in all events to the confidentiality
provisions of Section 17.2, and subject to the following sentence, Lender may
with, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the prior
written consent of Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld, sell or agree to
sell to one or more other Persons a participation in all or any part of the
Revolving Loan Commitment, and/or the Term Loan Commitment, and/or any portion
of the Revolving Loan or the Term Loan held by it or to be made by it. If Lender
sells any such participation, Lender shall remain responsible for the
performance of its obligations hereunder and Borrower shall continue to deal
solely and directly with Lender in connection with Lender's rights and
obligations hereunder. All amounts payable by Borrower to Lender under this


                                       49
<PAGE>
Agreement shall be determined as if Lender had not sold or agreed to sell any
participations in any portion of the Revolving Loan or Term Loan and as if
Lender were funding all of the Revolving Loan or Term Loan in the same way that
it is funding the portion of the Revolving Loan and Term Loan in which no
participations have been sold. The participant's rights against Lender in
respect of such participation shall be set forth in the agreement executed by
Lender and the participant.

each Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder and under the Facility
Documents.

      10.4 Compliance with Laws. Borrower and each Guarantor shall comply in all

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of Borrower or impair the ability of Borrower
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Facility Documents, or

and (ii) any material adverse development in any such previously disclosed
litigation.

part thereof any other or additional Lien other than the liens or security of
the Facility Documents, except for the Permitted Liens.

                                       61
<PAGE>
      due and such failure shall continue beyond the applicable grace period; or
      (y) Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof shall otherwise default under any
      agreement or instrument in a principal amount of at least $5,000,000; or

            (j) a Change of Control of Borrower shall have occurred; or

            (k) except for the litigation matters set forth on Schedule 7
      attached hereto, there shall be pending any litigation, investigation or
      proceeding which Borrower is required to disclose pursuant to Section
      10.9, which in the reasonable opinion of Lender is likely to materially
      adversely impair the ability of Borrower or any Guarantor to perform its
      obligations under this Agreement or any other Facility Document; or

            (l) any provision (except any provision that shall be immaterial to
      Lender) of any Facility Document shall for any reason cease to be a legal,
      valid and binding obligation of Borrower or any Guarantor, or Borrower or
      any Guarantor shall so state in writing; or

            (m) the certificate of incorporation or articles of organization of
      Borrower or any Guarantor shall be amended, supplemented or otherwise
      modified without the consent of Lender (except as expressly permitted
      hereunder); or

            (n) the occurrence of any event which materially adversely affects
      the collectibility of a material portion of the Receivables; or

            (o) Borrower or any Guarantor shall fail to maintain at least the
      types of insurance set forth in Schedule 16 hereto in at least the minimum
      amounts set forth in Schedule 16 hereto or any such insurance shall be
      issued by an insurance company or companies not licensed to do business in
      the applicable state(s) or not rated "A-VIII" or better by A.M. Best
      Company and, in any such case, such failure or condition shall continue or
      exist for 30 days after the earlier to occur of (i) written notice thereof
      to Borrower by Lender and (ii) knowledge thereof by Borrower; or

            (p) a material adverse change in Borrower has occurred as measured
      against the Budget; or

            (q) the sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, mortgage or assignment
      of any part or all of the Owned Real Estate, or any interest therein, or
      any interest in any Guarantor (other than Permitted Liens), in violation
      of Section 10.18 of this Agreement; or

            (r) Any default under any document or instrument, other than the
      Facility Documents, evidencing or creating a Lien on the Owned Real Estate
      or any part thereof for 20 days after the earlier to occur of (i) written
      notice thereof to Borrower or any Guarantor by Lender and (ii) knowledge
      thereof by Borrower or any Guarantor;

then, and in every such event and so long as such Event of Default shall be
continuing, Lender may, (i) by notice to Borrower (such notice, a "Notice of
Termination") (x) terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment and Term Loan
Commitment and/or (y) declare the Revolving Notes and Term Notes (together with
accrued interest thereon) to be, and the Revolving Notes and Term Notes shall
thereupon become, immediately due and payable without presentment,


                                       62
<PAGE>
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
Borrower; provided that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order
for relief with respect to Borrower under state or federal bankruptcy or
insolvency laws, or any other Event of Default specified in clause (h) above
which has the effect of staying actions against Borrower, without any notice to
Borrower or any other act by Lender, the Revolving Loan Commitment and Term Loan
Commitment shall thereupon terminate and the Revolving Note and Term Note
(together with accrued interest thereon) shall become immediately due and
payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby waived by Borrower and (ii) exercise any or all of the rights
and remedies set forth in this Agreement and under applicable law.

      12.2 Default Remedies. In addition to (and without limiting Lender's
remedies under) Section 12.1, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Lender may exercise any right, power or remedy permitted to it by
law, either by suit in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the Facility Documents or
for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms of the Facility
Documents or in aid of any exercise of any power granted to Lender in the
Facility Documents, or may proceed to enforce payment of the Revolving Loan and
Term Loan or to enforce any other legal or equitable right of Lender under this
Agreement. No remedy herein (including, without limitation, in Section 12.1
hereof) conferred upon Lender is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy
and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, by
statute or otherwise. No course of dealing on the part of Lender, or any delay
or failure on the part of Lender to exercise any right or power, shall operate
as a waiver of such right or power or otherwise prejudice the rights, powers and
remedies of Lender. No failure to insist upon strict compliance with any
covenant, term, condition or other provision of the Facility Documents or the
Revolving Note or Term Note shall constitute a waiver by Lender of any such
covenant, term, condition or other provision or of any Default or Event of
Default in connection therewith. To the extent effective under applicable Law,
Borrower hereby agrees to waive, and does hereby absolutely and irrevocably
waive and relinquish, the benefit and advantage of any valuation, stay,
appraisement, extension or redemption laws now existing or that may hereafter
exist that, but for this provision, might be applicable to any sale made under
any judgment, order or decree of any court, or otherwise, based on the Revolving
Loan or Term Loan or on any claim for interest in respect of the Revolving Loan
or Term Loan. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, Borrower
will pay to Lender, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and not paid
in accordance with Section 12.1 hereof, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection and of the
taking of remedial actions and the maintenance of enforcement proceedings,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements.

SECTION 13. INDEMNIFICATION; EXPENSES.

      13.1 Indemnification. (a) Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Lender, the directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates of Lender and
each Person who controls Lender within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and any and all
reasonable expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending


                                       63
<PAGE>
against any litigation, commenced or threatened, whether or not Lender is a
party thereto, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in
settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which any of them
may become subject to the extent that any such claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses arise under, in connection with or otherwise
relate to the transactions contemplated herein, including, without limitation,
any litigation relating to the proposed or actual use of the proceeds of any
Borrowing, or under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or
state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, provided, that
Borrower shall not be liable to Lender for:

                  (i) losses incurred by Lender as a result of the fraudulent
            actions, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender; or

                  (ii) losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising
            out of the imposition by any taxing authority of any federal income,
            state or local income or franchise taxes, or any other taxes imposed
            on or measured by gross or net income, gross or net receipts,
            capital, doing business taxes, net worth and similar items
            (including any interest, penalties or additions with respect
            thereto) upon Lender (including any liabilities, costs or expenses
            with respect thereto) or any other tax or similar charge which is
            excluded from indemnification pursuant to the express terms of this
            Agreement. The foregoing is in addition to any rights (including
            without limitation rights to indemnity) to which Lender may
            otherwise be entitled; provided that this provision shall not
            entitle Lender to be paid hereunder twice for the same loss.

            (b) The obligations of Borrower under this Section 13.1 shall be in
addition to any liability which it may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the
same terms and conditions, to each Person, if any, who controls Lender within
the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and to each director of
Lender.

Promptly upon receipt by Lender under this Section 13.1 of notice of the
commencement of any suit, action, claim, proceeding or governmental
investigation against Lender, Lender shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to
be made against Borrower hereunder, notify Borrower in writing of the
commencement thereof. Borrower may participate in and assume the defense of any
such suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation at its expense. No
settlement of any suit, action, claim proceeding or investigation (regardless of
which party is controlling the defense) shall be made without the approval of
Borrower and Lender, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. After notice from Borrower to Lender of its intention to assume the
defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Lender and so long as
Borrower so assumes, and diligently proceeds with, the defense thereof in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to Lender, Borrower shall not be liable for any
legal expenses of separate counsel for Lender unless there shall be a conflict
between the interests of Borrower and Lender, in which case Lender shall have
the right to employ one separate counsel to represent it (at Borrower's
expense). If Borrower assumes the defense of any suit, Borrower shall use all
reasonable efforts to:


                                       64
<PAGE>
            (i) consult, from time to time, with Lender about the strategy being
      pursued;

            (ii) promptly inform Lender of any material developments in such
      suit; and

            (iii) forward to Lender promptly after receipt thereof copies of any
      notices, filings, requests or other written materials relating to such
      suit, and if Lender reasonably determines that the defense being carried
      out by Borrower materially adversely affects the interests of Lender,
      Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower and Lender
      shall use reasonable efforts to agree on a defense strategy that is
      acceptable to both parties and, failing such agreement within 20 days of
      the aforesaid notice, Borrower shall pay the reasonable expenses of
      separate counsel retained by Lender.

            (c) Lender shall use its good faith efforts to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any losses, expenses or claims for indemnification; provided, that
Lender shall not be obligated to take any action which would subject Lender to
any unreimbursed cost or expense or which would otherwise be disadvantageous to
Lender.

The agreement, indemnities and other statements of Borrower in or made pursuant
to this Section 13.1 will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of
Lender or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in
this Section 13.1. The provisions of this Section 13.1 shall survive the
termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

      13.2 Expenses. Borrower agrees, promptly upon receipt of a written
invoice, to pay or cause to be paid, and to save Lender harmless against
liability for the payment of, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, accountant's and other third
parties' fees and expenses, and any filing fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of Lender (but excluding salaries and overhead costs incurred by or on
behalf of Lender):

            (a) in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and
      preparation of this Agreement and the other Facility Documents and the
      transactions contemplated by or undertaken pursuant to or in connection
      herewith or therewith (including, without limitation, the perfection or
      protection of Lender's security interest in the Collateral); and

            (b) from time to time:

            (i) relating to any requested amendments, waivers or consents under
      the Facility Documents;

            (ii) arising in connection with Lender's enforcement or preservation
      of its rights (including, without limitation, the perfection and
      protection of its interest in the Collateral) under the Facility
      Documents; or

            (iii) arising in connection with any audit, dispute, disagreement,
      litigation or preparation for litigation involving the Facility Documents.

      security interest, claim or otherwise).

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 14.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, "Collateral" expressly excludes
Excluded Collateral. To the extent the provisions of this Section 14.1 or other
provisions of this Agreement create a security interest in any property that
subsequently falls within the definition of Excluded Collateral, Lender hereby
agrees that such property shall be automatically released at that time from any
such security interest and that Lender shall from that time have no further
security interest or other right in or to such property.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 14.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, "Collateral" expressly excludes (i)
until Borrower executes and delivers to Lender the Alliance Pledge Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.29(iii), the Alliance Membership Interest (and
automatically upon such execution and delivery, the Alliance Membership Interest
shall constitute Collateral), and (ii) until Borrower executes and delivers to
Lender the applicable Collateral Assignment pursuant to Section 10.29(i) and/or
Section 10.29(ii), the applicable Second Closing Date Collateral (and
automatically upon such execution and delivery, the applicable Second Closing
Date Collateral shall constitute Collateral).


                                       67
<PAGE>
            (d) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall
not subject Lender to, or transfer or in any way affect or modify, any
obligation or liability of Borrower with respect to any of the Collateral or any
transaction in connection therewith.

      14.2 Further Assurances; Protection of Lender's Security Interest. (a) In
connection with the grant under Section 14.1 (but subject to Section 14.1(b)),
Borrower agrees to record and file, at its own expense, financing statements
with respect to the Collateral, whether now existing and hereafter created or
acquired, suitable to reflect the transfer of accounts, general intangibles and
chattel paper (each as defined in Article 9 of the UCC) and meeting the
requirements of applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as
are necessary to perfect the pledge of the Collateral to Lender. Additionally,
Borrower shall if any Account, Receivable or General Intangible shall be
evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument or chattel paper, delivering
and pledging to Lender hereunder such note, instrument or chattel paper duly
indorsed and accompanied by executed instruments of transfer or assignment, all
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, as may be necessary or desirable
or that Lender may request in order to perfect and preserve the security
interest purported to be created hereby

            (b) Borrower shall maintain its books and records so that such
records shall indicate clearly that Borrower's right, title and interest in the
Collateral has been collaterally assigned by Borrower to Lender.

            (c) Borrower agrees that from time to time, at its sole expense, it
shall promptly authenticate and deliver all additional instruments and documents
and take all additional actions that Lender may reasonably request in order to
perfect the interests of Lender in and to, or to protect, the Collateral or to
enable Lender to exercise or enforce any of its rights thereunder and hereunder.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Lender shall be permitted,
and Borrower hereby authorizes Lender, to file the original UCC-! Financing
statements and amendments to financing statements and assignments thereof
consistent with the terms of this Agreement (including any amendment hereto or
other modification hereof). Carbon, photographic or other reproductions of this
Agreement or any financing statement shall be sufficient as a financing
statement.

      14.3 General Authority. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender its
true and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of
Borrower, or otherwise, for the sole use and benefit of Lender, but at
Borrower's expense, to the extent permitted by Law to exercise, at any time and
from time to time while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all
or any of the following powers with respect to all or any of the Collateral:

            (a) to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for
      any and all monies due or to become due thereon or by virtue thereof,

            (b) to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any action
      or proceeding with respect thereto,

            (c) to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the
      Collateral or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as
      if Lender were the absolute owner thereof, and


                                       68
<PAGE>



              (d) to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to
make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto;

provided, that Lender shall give Borrower 10 days' prior written notice of the
time and place of any sale or other intended disposition of any of the
Collateral. Borrower agrees that such notice constitutes "reasonable
authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of Section 9-611
of the UCC.

         14.4 Collection of Receivables. Subject to the mandatory prepayment
obligations set forth in Section 8.2 hereof, and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement or in any other Facility Document to the contrary, Borrower shall
have the right to collect any and all payments of interest and principal made by
the Obligors under the Receivables and to exercise any and all rights and
remedies Borrower has under the loan documents which evidence, govern or secure
the Receivables until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Upon
the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled
to collect and all payments of interest and principal made by the Obligors under
the Receivables and to exercise any and all rights and remedies under such
Facility Documents. The Lender shall have the right at any time, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, or a Default, to
notify the account debtors or obligors under any Receivables and General
Intangibles and to direct such account debtors or Obligors to make payment of
all amounts due or to become due to the Borrower thereunder directly to the
Lender and, upon such notification and at the expense of the Borrower and to the
extent permitted by law, to enforce collection of any such Receivables and
General Intangibles. The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender the
Borrower's attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full authority in the place and
stead of the Borrower and in the name of the Borrower or otherwise, from time to
time in the Lender's discretion, to take any action and to execute any
instrument which the Lender may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the
purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) upon the
occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, or a Default, to ask, demand,
collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give acquitence and receipts
for moneys due and to become due under or in respect of any Collateral; (ii)
upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, or a Default, to
receive, indorse, and collect any drafts or other instruments, documents and
chattel paper in connection with clause (i) of this subsection (b); and (iii)
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, or a Default, to file any claims or
take any action or institute any proceedings which the Lender may deem necessary
or desirable for the collection of any Collateral or otherwise to enforce the
rights of the Lender with respect to any Collateral. The powers conferred on the
Lender hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall
not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe
custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys
actually received by it hereunder, the Lender shall have no duty as to any
Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against
prior party or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.

         14.5 Remedies upon Event of Default. If any Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Lender may exercise all rights of a secured party
under the applicable UCC and, in addition, Lender may, without being required to
give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory
provisions of Law, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in any commercially
reasonable manner at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future
delivery, and at such price or prices as Lender may deem satisfactory. Borrower
will execute

                                       69
<PAGE>
and deliver such documents and take such other action as Lender reasonably deems
necessary or advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance
with Law. Upon any such sale, Lender shall have the right to deliver, assign and
transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any
such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold to it absolutely and free from any
claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption
of Borrower which may be waived, and Borrower, to the extent permitted by Law,
hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal which it
has or may have under any Law now existing or hereafter adopted. Lender, instead
of exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit
or suits at law or in equity to foreclose the Security Interests and sell the
Collateral, or any portion thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction.

For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under this
Agreement, Lender shall have access to and may use Borrower's books and records
relating to the Collateral and Borrower shall:

              (a) deliver to Lender such information relating to the Collateral
as Lender may reasonably request, and
