<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&#147;Operating Income&#148; is defined as GAAP net income less (i)&nbsp;after-tax extraordinary gains(losses) and
(ii)&nbsp;after-tax investment gains (losses). &#147;Average Shareholders&#146; Equity&#148; shall mean the quotient
of (i)&nbsp;the sum of UAI&#146;s shareholders&#146; equity on the December&nbsp;31 immediately prior to the ROE
Measuring Period and on the last day of each calendar quarter within such ROE Measuring Period and
(ii)&nbsp;the number of the measuring dates used in calculating the sum in subclause (i) (<I>i.e.</I>, 5, 9 or
13 measuring dates). If UAI achieves a ROE in a ROE Measuring Period of 10%, 12% or 15%, then the
Executive shall be granted Shares with a value equal to 14%, 40% or 80% of the Annual Salary as of
the March 1 following the ROE Measuring Period, respectively, subject to the Executive being
employed as of such date by the Company or one of its Affiliates or successors as of such grant
date. Achievement of ROE shall be determined by the UAI Board in its sole discretion. Such award
shall vest in three equal installments, with the first tranche vesting on December&nbsp;31 of the year
the award is granted and the second and third tranches vesting on December&nbsp;31 of each of the next
two years, respectively, subject to the Executive&#146;s being employed by the Company or one of its
Affiliates or successors as of such date, provided that this condition shall be satisfied, and the
Executive will be permitted to continue to vest in the award, if the Executive&#146;s employment is
terminated as described in Section 9(b) hereof. The Annual Direct Salary used in making any
determinations pursuant to this paragraph shall be the Annual Direct Salary as of the last day of
the relevant ROE Measuring Period.

for any fiscal years following 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;INTEGRATION BONUS. The Executive shall be eligible for an integration award of Shares
based on the compounded annual growth in the book value per share of UAI (&#147;Book Value Growth&#148;) in
the event that a &#147;Change in Control&#148; (as defined below) occurs on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2010.
For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), a &#147;Change in Control&#148; is a transaction or a series of related
transactions such that, following such transaction(s), a person or entity, or a group of persons or
entities acting in concert, unaffiliated with Fox Paine Capital International GP, L.P. controls
shares representing more than fifty percent of the voting power of UAI. As soon as practical
following a Change in Control, the UAI Board shall determine Book Value Growth for the period
beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2006 and ending as of the date the Change in Control occurred (the &#147;CiC
Date&#148;). Book Value Growth of at least 10% (but less than 12%) shall result in a preliminary
determination of 17,500 Shares, at least 12% (but less than 13%) in 26,250 Shares, at least 13%
(but less than 15%) in 35,000 Shares and 15% or more in 52,500 Shares. Such Share figure shall
then be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the consideration provided to former
UAI shareholders in connection with the Change in Control and the denominator of which is the book
value of the stake acquired of UAI, determined as of the CiC Date, by the unaffiliated persons or
entities in connection with the Change in Control (the resulting figure, the &#147;CiC Share
Determination&#148;). The Executive shall then be awarded, and shall vest in full, in a number of
Shares equal to the CiC Share Determination, subject to the Executive being employed by the Company
or one of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Change in Control. Any calculation or
determination pursuant to the foregoing shall be made by the UAI Board in its sole discretion. For
purposes of the foregoing, the book value of UAI as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 was $17.51 per share. In
the event that no Change in Control occurs on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2010, the UAI Board may
elect, in its sole discretion, to award the Executive Shares in lieu of an award pursuant to the
foregoing.
