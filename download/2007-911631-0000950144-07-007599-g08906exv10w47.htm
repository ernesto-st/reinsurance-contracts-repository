other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or
are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such
deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender and their respective
Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights
of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application,
<U>provided</U> that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff
and application.

Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the
maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the &#147;<U>Maximum Rate</U>&#148;). If
the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such
unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for,
charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person
may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)&nbsp;characterize any payment that is not principal
as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)&nbsp;exclude voluntary prepayments and the
effects thereof, and (c)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the
total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.
This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
<U>Section&nbsp;4.01</U>, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.
Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or
on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice
or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or
unsatisfied.
