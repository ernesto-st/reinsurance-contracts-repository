of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory
successor of the Company has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed, however,
that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written
notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the Policy or
bond reinsured, which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer, within
a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the
receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim
and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any
defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver,
conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be
chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of
conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue
to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

Pennsylvania, but the venue may be changed when deemed by the panel to be in the best interest of
the arbitration proceeding. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to substantive law, it shall

appropriate.

communications shall be made by the Company to each of the subscribing reinsurers constituting the
one party; provided, however, that nothing therein shall impair the rights of such subscribing
reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing
