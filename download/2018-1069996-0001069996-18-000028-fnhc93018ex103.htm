Article 7 - Late Payments   A.  The provisions of this Article shall not be implemented unless specifically invoked, in      writing, by one of the parties to this Contract.    B.  In the event any premium, loss or other payment due either party is not received by the      intermediary named in the Intermediary Article (hereinafter referred to as the      &quot;Intermediary&quot;) by the payment due date, the party to whom payment is due may, by      notifying the Intermediary in writing, require the debtor party to pay, and the debtor party      agrees to pay, an interest charge on the amount past due calculated for each such payment      on the last business day of each month as follows:         1.  The number of full days which have expired since the due date or the last monthly           calculation, whichever the lesser; times         2.  1/365ths of the six-month United States Treasury Bill rate as quoted in The Wall Street           Journal on the first business day of the month for which the calculation is made; times         3.  The amount past due, including accrued interest.        It is agreed that interest shall accumulate until payment of the original amount due plus      interest charges have been received by the Intermediary.    C.  The establishment of the due date shall, for purposes of this Article, be determined as      follows:         1.  As respects the payment of routine deposits and premiums due the Reinsurer, the due           date shall be as provided for in the applicable section of this Contract.  In the event a           due date is not specifically stated for a given payment, it shall be deemed due 30 days           after the date of transmittal by the Intermediary of the initial billing for each such           payment.         2.  Any claim or loss payment due the Company hereunder shall be deemed due 10 days           after the proof of loss or demand for payment is transmitted to the Reinsurer.  If such           loss or claim payment is not received within the 10 days, interest will accrue on the           payment or amount overdue in accordance with paragraph B above, from the date the           proof of loss or demand for payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer.         3.  As respects any payment, adjustment or return due either party not otherwise           provided for in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of this paragraph C, the due date shall be as           provided for in the applicable section of this Contract.  In the event a due date is not           specifically stated for a given payment, it shall be deemed due 10 days following           transmittal of written notification that the provisions of this Article have been invoked.        For purposes of interest calculations only, amounts due hereunder shall be deemed paid      upon receipt by the Intermediary.     18\F7V1072  Page 4      </FONT></DIV>

Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting a Subscribing Reinsurer from      contesting the validity of any claim, or from participating in the defense of any claim or suit,      or prohibiting either party from contesting the validity of any payment or from initiating any      arbitration or other proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.  If the      debtor party prevails in an arbitration or other proceeding, then any interest charges due      hereunder on the amount in dispute shall be null and void.  If the debtor party loses in such      proceeding, then the interest charge on the amount determined to be due hereunder shall      be calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth above unless otherwise      determined by such proceedings.

In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to      the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of      the liability of the Company without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or      because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has      failed to pay all or a portion of any claim.  It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver,      conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the      Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond      reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a      reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in      the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate      such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be      adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its      liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the      Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company      as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the      benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by      the Reinsurer.    B.  Where two or more Subscribing Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in      interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in      accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by      the Company.    C.  It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the      reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company      or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by Section 4118(a) of      the New York Insurance Law or except (1) where this Contract specifically provides another      payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or (2) where the      Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy      obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such      policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees.      Article 17 - Arbitration   A.  As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or      difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually      agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One      Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall      be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active      or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's      London Underwriters.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an Arbiter within      30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may      choose two Arbiters who shall in turn choose an Umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If      the two Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an Umpire within 30 days following their      appointment, each Arbiter shall nominate three candidates within 10 days thereafter, two of      whom the other shall decline, and the decision shall be made by drawing lots.   18\F7V1072  Page 8      </FONT></DIV>

Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters within 30 days following the date of      appointment of the Umpire.  The Arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable      engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial      formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the      Arbiters shall be final and binding on both parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the      Umpire and the decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon both parties.       Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters may be entered in any court of competent      jurisdiction.    C.  If more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such      Subscribing Reinsurers shall, at the option of the Company, constitute and act as one party      for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of      the Subscribing Reinsurers constituting one party, provided, however, that nothing herein      shall impair the rights of such Subscribing Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint,      defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Subscribing Reinsurers      participating under the terms of this Contract from several to joint.    D.  Each party shall bear the expense of its own Arbiter, and shall jointly and equally bear with      the other the expense of the Umpire and of the arbitration.  In the event that the two      Arbiters are chosen by one party, as above provided, the expense of the Arbiters, the      Umpire and the arbitration shall be equally divided between the two parties.    E.  Any arbitration proceedings shall take place at a location mutually agreed upon by the      parties to this Contract, but notwithstanding the location of the arbitration, all proceedings      pursuant hereto shall be governed by the law of the state in which the Company has its      principal office.      Article 18 - Service of Suit (BRMA 49C)   (Applicable if the Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America, and/or is not  authorized in any State, Territory or District of the United States where authorization is required  by insurance regulatory authorities)    A.  It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount claimed to be due      hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a      court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.  Nothing in this Article constitutes or      should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an      action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a      United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by      the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States.    B.  Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which      makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby designates the party named in its Interests      and Liabilities Agreement, or if no party is named therein, the Superintendent,      Commissioner or Director of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the      statute, or his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon whom      may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on      behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract.     18\F7V1072  Page 9      </FONT></DIV>

The Company may require that any third-party      representatives of the Reinsurer agree, in writing, to be bound by this Confidentiality Article      or by a separate written confidentiality agreement, containing terms no less stringent than      those set forth in this Article.  If a third-party representative of the Reinsurer is not bound, in      writing, by this Confidentiality Article or by a separate written confidentiality agreement, the      Reinsurer shall be responsible for any breach of this provision by such third-party      representative of the Reinsurer.
