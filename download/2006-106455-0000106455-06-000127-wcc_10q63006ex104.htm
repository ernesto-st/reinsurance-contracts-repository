&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Agent shall have been notified by any Lender or
Institutional Lender                prior to the date of a Borrowing that such Lender or
Institutional Lender does                not intend to make available to Agent its
portion of the Borrowings to be made                on such date, Agent may assume that
such Lender or Institutional Lender has made                such amount available to
Agent on such date and Agent in its sole discretion                may, in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to Borrower a                corresponding amount. If
such corresponding amount is not in fact made available                to the Agent by
such Lender or Institutional Lender and Agent has made such                amount
available to Borrower, Agent shall be entitled to recover such
               corresponding amount on demand from such Lender or Institutional Lender.
If such                Lender or Institutional Lender does not pay such corresponding
amount forthwith                upon Agent&#146;s demand therefor, Agent shall promptly
notify Borrower and                Borrower shall immediately repay such corresponding
amount to Agent. Agent shall                also be entitled to recover from such Lender
or Institutional Lender or                Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect                of each day from the date such
corresponding amount was made available by Agent                to Borrower to the date
such corresponding amount is recovered by Agent, at the                Federal Funds Rate
until the third Banking Day, and at the Base Rate plus the                Base Rate
Margin thereafter. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any                Lender or
Institutional Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments
               hereunder or to prejudice any rights which Borrower may have against any
Lender                or Institutional Lender as a result of any default by such Lender
or                Institutional Lender hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein or in                any other Loan Instrument to the contrary, Agent may, subject
to the rights of                the other Secured Parties under the Security Documents,
apply all funds and                proceeds of collateral available for the payment of
any Obligations first to                repay any amount owing by any Lender or

Not                later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on each Tranche B Interest
Payment Date,                Borrower shall pay to Agent for the account of the

Tranche B Fixing Date,                Institutional Agent shall provide Agent and
Borrower with written notice setting                forth the Tranche B Fixed Amount and

Agent                under this Section 2.2(b) no more than three times during any period

determined by Institutional Agent, with                notice of such determination

               Letter of Credit and the Rova II Virginia Power Letter of Credit shall
each                expire on December 22, 1995. With the prior consent of Lenders, at
least six                months prior to such expiration date (as extended from time to

renew the Rova I                Virginia Power Letter of Credit or the Rova II Virginia

               be conditioned on terms, to be negotiated by Borrower and the Lenders (in
               consultation with Institutional Agent) if all such parties mutually agree
to do                so, that provide for collateralizing the reimbursement of draws

Virginia Power Letter of                Credit is extended beyond the 12th anniversary of
the Rova II Commercial                Operations Date, such extension shall be

a Virginia Power Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank,                Borrower shall
promptly notify Virginia Power, and Borrower shall, at least two                months
prior to the expiration date thereof (as extended from time to time),

among Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders and Agent, Borrower hereby assumes all risks
of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by its beneficiary or any
successor thereto. The Issuing Bank, the Lenders and Agent shall not be responsible: (i)
for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of, or the
making of any drawing under, any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be
in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged, (ii) for
the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to
transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason,
(iii) for failure of any beneficiary to comply fully with the conditions required in order
to effect a drawing, (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission
or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, (v) for any
loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document or draft required in order
to make any drawing and (vi) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control
of the Issuing Bank, the Lenders or Agent, except only that Borrower shall have a claim
against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be liable to Borrower, to the extent,
but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential, damages suffered by
Borrower which Borrower proves were caused by (A) the Issuing Bank&#146;s willful
misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under a Letter
of Credit comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (B) the Issuing Bank&#146;s
failure to pay under a Letter of Credit in accordance with its terms after the
presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate strictly complying
with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their
face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent
the vesting of any of the Issuing Bank&#146;s rights or powers hereunder. </FONT></P>

Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to the           Letters of Credit, and
each such Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the           Issuing Bank, as the Issuing

exercise such powers and perform such duties as are           expressly delegated to the
Issuing Bank by the terms of this Agreement, together           with such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any           provision to the

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Issuing Bank in its           capacity as such (to the

Borrower to do so), ratably according to each Lender&#146;s <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> share

for the payment of any portion of           such liabilities, obligations, losses,

resulting solely from the Issuing           Bank&#146;s gross negligence or willful
misconduct or for the payment of any           portion of the L/C Fees. The agreements in
this Section 3.5(d) shall survive the           payment of the L/C Reimbursement

this Agreement.  </FONT></P>

of the other Lenders and each such Lender hereby unconditionally and irrevocably,
severally and for itself only, takes an undivided participating interest in the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under, and in connection with, the Series 1991 Letter
of Credit Facility and the Series 1993 Letter of Credit Facility in each case in a
fraction equal to such Lender&#146;s Loan Commitment Percentage. Subject to the
limitations set forth below, each of the other Lenders shall be liable to the Issuing
Bank for its <U>pro rata</U> share, based upon its Loan Commitment Percentage, of the
amount of any draft drawn and honored by the Issuing Bank under the Series 1991 Letter of
Credit and the Series 1993 Letter of Credit. Such liability shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any condition or event,
including without limitation: (i) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default under
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, (ii) any lack of validity or enforceability
of this Agreement, the Bond Letters of Credit or any of the other Loan Instruments, (iii)
any amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, all or any of the Loan
Instruments, (iv) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which
Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of the Bond
Letters of Credit (or any persons or entities for whom any such beneficiary or any such
transferee may be acting), Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders or any other person or
entity, whether in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Loan Instruments or
any unrelated transactions, (v) any statement or any other document presented under the
Bond Letters of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever,
(vi) payment by the Issuing Bank under the Bond Letters of Credit against presentation of
a draft or certificate which does not comply with the terms thereof, <U>provided</U> that
such payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Issuing Bank, or (vii) any other circumstances or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, <U>provided</U> that the same shall not have constituted
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank.  </FONT></P>

harmless the Issuing Bank from and against any and all           losses, liabilities
(including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits,           judgments, demands,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation,           reasonable attorneys&#146; fees

Letters of Credit, in accordance with the           provisions of the preceding sentence

caused by any other Lender or Agent. If a           Lender does not pay to Agent for the

any Drawing under the Bond Letters           of Credit by 3:30 p.m. (New York time) on

from the date the Drawing is honored until           the date such Lender&#146;s payment
is received by Agent for the account of the           Issuing Bank. If Agent for the
account of the Issuing Bank receives a           Lender&#146;s <U>pro</U> <U>rata </U>share
of any Drawing under the Bond Letters           of Credit on the disbursement date
therefor or if Agent for the account of the           Issuing Bank receives interest on
any late payment from such Lender in           accordance with the provisions of the

               thereof. If and when cash is required for disbursement in accordance with
this                Section 6.1, Agent is authorized, without instructions from Borrower,
to the                extent necessary to make payments required pursuant to this Section
6.1 in the                event Borrower fails to do so in a timely manner, to cause
Permitted Investments                to be sold or otherwise liquidated into cash
(without regard to maturity) in                such manner as Agent shall deem reasonable
and prudent under the circumstances.                All funds in the Accounts and all
Permitted Investments made in respect thereof,                shall be held by Agent and
the interests of Borrower therein shall constitute                part of the security
subject to the pledge and security interests created by the                Security
Documents; provided, that if at any time any funds are to be invested                in
Permitted Investments in accordance with this paragraph (k) but Agent is
               unable or unwilling at such time to purchase or hold the Permitted
Investments                selected, then such funds shall be transferred to Swiss
American Securities,                Inc., a subsidiary of Credit Suisse (&#147;SASI&#148;)
(or any successor                custodian thereto requested by Borrower and approved by
Agent and Institutional                Agent), so that the selected investments may be
made and held while permitting                the Secured Parties to maintain their
perfected and prior security interests in                the funds and/or investments in
a manner and pursuant to documentation                satisfactory to Agent and
Institutional Agent. Borrower shall pay Agent or SASI                (or its successor)
the published fees applicable at the time to the transactions                then
effected pursuant to this paragraph (k). Upon the instructions of Borrower,
               to be issued at its option, Agent shall transfer such funds from any one
or more                of the Project Control Account (excluding the Rova II
Sub-Account), the Rova I                Contingency Account, the Rova II Contingency
Account, the Tranche A Repayment                Account or the Tranche B Repayment
Account to an Investment Institution for                investment by such Investment
Institution into Permitted Investments; <U>provided</U>, that no such transfers shall be
made by Agent to an Investment                Institution until (i) such Investment
Institution has acknowledged and agreed in                writing that it is holding such
funds and Permitted Investments in its capacity                as collateral agent for
Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in order to                maintain Agent&#146;s
first priority lien and security interest therein, that it                will maintain
continuous possession of such funds at all times in accordance                with the
provisions of this Section 6.1(k) and that it shall release such funds                to
Agent and only upon the written instructions thereof and (ii) Borrower and
               any such Investment Institution have executed all security agreements and
               financing statements that Agent deems necessary in order to maintain a
first                priority security interest in the funds and Permitted Investments
held by the                Investment Institution. All such funds held by Agent or the
Investment                Institution, as the case may be, and all such Permitted
Investments made in                respect thereof, shall be held by Agent or the
Investment Institution, as the                case may be, and the interest of Borrower
therein shall constitute part of the                security subject to the pledge and
security interests created by this Agreement                and the other Security
Documents. Agent&#146;s remedies and rights under this                Section 6.1 or
Section 7.2 hereof with respect to any funds transferred from any                Account
to an Investment Institution shall remain unchanged, notwithstanding                such
transfer. The term &#147;Investment Institution&#148; means a brokerage,
               investment or similar firm selected by Borrower and approved (and not
               subsequently disapproved) by Agent, for the purpose of making Permitted
               Investments on behalf of Borrower pursuant to Section 6.1(k) hereof, <U>provided</U>,
that Agent&#146;s approval or disapproval shall not be                unreasonably

Borrower shall use, maintain and operate the Facilities and           the Property in
compliance with generally accepted Prudent Utility Practices (as           defined in the
Rova I Power Purchase Agreement and the Rova II Power Purchase           Agreement), all
Project Documents, this Agreement and, except where           non-compliance could not
have a materially adverse effect on Borrower, the           Facilities, the Property,
Borrower&#146;s ability to perform its obligations           under the Loan Instruments,
Project Documents or the Bond Documents or the           rights or interests of the
Secured Parties, all applicable Governmental           Requirements. Borrower shall use
its best efforts to use, maintain and operate           the Facilities and the Property
in accordance with the Rova I Operating Budget           and the Rova II Operating
Budget. Borrower shall inspect, maintain, service and           repair the Rova I
Facility and the Rova Facility so as to keep the Rova I           Facility and the Rova
II Facility (i) in as good operating condition as upon           Rova I Final Completion
and Rova II Final Completion, respectively (normal wear           and tear excepted),
(ii) in good order and repair in conformity with prudent           industry standards and
commercial practice, (iii) in compliance with all           requirements under the
Project Documents and (iv) in such condition that the           Rova I Facility and the
Rova II Facility will have the capacity and functional           ability to perform, in
normal commercial operation, the functions and at the           ratings set forth in the
Project Documents for their remaining useful life.           Borrower shall cause the
Rova I Facility and the Rova II Facility to be operated           so as to preserve and
enforce all warranties and guaranties in respect thereof           and to which Borrower
is a beneficiary. Borrower shall not permit Operator to           subcontract (except to
the extent Borrower itself could have contracted by means           of a Permitted
Contract) for any material work without the prior written consent           of Agent and
Institutional Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be           withheld. Borrower
shall, immediately upon obtaining knowledge thereof, notify           Agent of any change
in the identity of the Facility Manager (as defined in           Section 5.5 of the
Operating Contract) or any delegation of Borrower&#146;s           responsibilities to
Operator as permitted or contemplated in Section 6.2 or 6.3           thereof. Borrower
shall comply with such repair, service and maintenance           standards and schedules
as are required to enforce warranty or guaranty claims           against Contractor,
Operator or subcontractors and any standards imposed by any           Insurance Policies
in effect with respect to the Rova I Facility, the Rova II           Facility or the
Property. Borrower&#146;s review of and comment on the manual of           &#147;Facility
Procedures&#148; pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Operating           Contract shall be
conducted subject to the Independent Engineer&#146;s approval,           which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Borrower shall promptly inform the           Independent
Engineer of any material amendment or modifications to           &#147;Facility Procedures&#148; proposed
by Operator, or any material changes to           such procedures proposed by Borrower,
under Section 5.4 of the Operating           Contract, with updates as to the status
thereof, and shall report to the           Independent Engineer the results of the annual
review made of such procedures as           contemplated in said section. Until all of
the Obligations have been fully           discharged, Borrower shall retain any
information Operator need no longer retain           pursuant to Section 5.17 of the
Operating Contract, or cause Operator to           continue to retain such information in
a reasonable manner. Borrower shall not           approve any &#147;Proposed Operating
Budget&#148; submitted for approval under           Section 7.1 of the Operating Contract
until such time as all approvals required           under Section 6.9(i) hereof have been
obtained for the Rova I Operating Budget           and the Rova II Operating Budget for
the year (or portion thereof) that is the           same as the first year (or portion
thereof) of such &#147;Proposed Operating           Budget&#148;. Borrower shall inform
Agent, Institutional Agent and the           Independent Engineer of any audit (and
results thereof) that is conducted at           Borrower&#146;s request under Section 7.6
of the Operating Contract and, at           Agent or Institutional Agent&#146;s request,
cause such audits to be conducted           to the full extent permitted to Borrower
under said Section. Borrower shall           promptly notify Agent and Institutional
Agent if it has the right to terminate           the Operating Contract under Section
18.3 thereof, and only upon the request of           Agent, which shall be made only upon
instruction of the Majority Lenders, shall           Borrower exercise such right and
shall then do so in the manner specified by           Agent.  </FONT></P>

to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, Agent may resign
at any time either under this Agreement or under the Security Documents by giving written
notice thereof to the Secured Parties and Borrower, and Agent may be removed at any time
with cause by the Majority Lenders. Agent, if it is not an Institutional Lender, shall
resign within 30 days after all Obligations to Lenders have been fully paid and discharged
and the Institutional Lenders may, at such time, reallocate among one or more entities the
responsibilities of Agent hereunder to make certain decisions hereunder, to hold the
various Accounts, and to act as collateral agent under the Security Documents. Borrower
may request the Majority Lenders to remove Agent upon Agent&#146;s gross negligence or
willful misconduct, and the Majority Lenders shall not unreasonably avoid such course of
action. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent, which appointment shall be subject to the approval of Borrower
if the appointee is not a Co-Agent or Institutional Agent, and such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Agent&#146;s notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders&#146; removal of the retiring
Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Secured Parties, appoint one of the
Co-Agents (as long as Obligations to Lenders remain outstanding) or Institutional Agent
(after all Obligations to Lenders have been fully paid and discharged) as successor Agent
(subject to such appointee&#146;s approval). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
After any retiring Agent&#146;s resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions
of this Article 8 shall continue in effect for such Agent&#146;s benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted by it while it served as Agent hereunder. </FONT></P>

the case may be (the &#147;Majority Institutional Lenders&#148;). Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Institutional Lenders shall have the right to appoint

Institutional Lender, as           appropriate, party to this Agreement and shall have
all the rights and           obligations of a Lender or Institutional Lender, as

Purchasing Institutional Lender, as           appropriate, and the resulting adjustment
of percentage shares of the           Construction Facility Commitment, Term Facility
Commitment, Institutional           Construction Loan Commitment and Institutional Term
Loan Commitment, as           appropriate, arising from the purchase by such Purchasing
Lender or Purchasing           Institutional Lender of all or a portion of the rights and
obligations of such           transferor Lender or Institutional Lender under this
Agreement and the Notes.           Upon the consummation of any transfer pursuant to this
Section 9.2(a), the           transferor Lender or Institutional Lender, Agent,
Institutional Agent and           Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that,
if required, replacement           Notes are issued to such transferor Lender or
Institutional Lender and new Notes           or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are

(i) to sell all or any part of its rights and           obligations under the Tranche&nbsp;A
Loan Notes to Purchasing Lenders only to           the extent and at the same time it

under the Tranche&nbsp;A Institutional           Notes to Purchasing Institutional

Institutional           Lender to be bound by a similar restriction with respect to any
such sales by           it. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Section           shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from transferring, pledging
or assigning           its rights under this Agreement (but not its obligations hereunder
to make Loans           or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit), its Loans and

Any Lender or Institutional Lender may, from time to           time, sell or offer to
sell any Loans or Institutional Loans owing to such           Lender or Institutional
Lender, any Notes held by such Lender or Institutional           Lender, any commitment
of such Lender or Institutional Lender or any other           interests and obligations
of such Lender or Institutional Lender hereunder, to           one or more participants
(each, a &#147;Participant&#148;), on such terms and           conditions as may be
determined by the selling party, without the consent of or           notice to Borrower (<U>provided</U> that
such Participant is not an Ineligible           Assignee) or any other Secured Party, and
the grant of such participation shall           not relieve any Lender or Institutional
Lender of its obligations, or impair the           rights of any Lender or Institutional
Lender, hereunder. Notwithstanding the           foregoing, any agreement pursuant to
which any Lender or Institutional Lender           may grant a participation shall
provide that such Lender or Institutional Lender           shall retain the sole right
and responsibility to exercise the rights of such           Lender or Institutional
Lender, and enforce the Obligations of Borrower           including, without limitation,
the right to approve any amendment, modification,           supplement or waiver of any
provision of any other Loan Instrument and the right           to take action under
Article&nbsp;7 hereof (<U>provided</U> that such           participation agreement may
provide that such Lender or Institutional Lender           will not agree to any
modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement,           without the consent of the
Participant, that would alter the principal of or           interest on the Loans or the
Institutional Loans, as appropriate, postpone the           date fixed for any payment of
principal of or interest thereon, release any           collateral or extend the term of
any commitment). No Participant shall have any           rights under this Agreement
other than to receive payment of principal of and           interest through such Lender
or Institutional Lender. Borrower also agrees that           each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.3(a), (b) and           (c) hereof with respect to
its participation granted hereunder; <U>provided</U>          that no Participant shall
be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to           such Sections than the
Lender or Institutional Lender transferring such           participation would have been
entitled to receive in respect of the amount of           the participation transferred
to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.           Each Lender hereby agrees
with Agent (i) to sell participations of its interest           in the Tranche&nbsp;A
Loan Notes to any Participant only to the extent that at           the same time it sells
an equivalent <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> participation of its           interest in the Tranche&nbsp;B
Loan Notes to such Participant and (ii) to cause           each such Participant to be
bound by a similar restriction with respect to           sub-participations. Each
Institutional Lender hereby agrees with Agent (i) to           sell participations of its
interest in the Tranche&nbsp;A Institutional Notes to           any Participant only to
the extent and at the same time it sells an equivalent <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> participation
of its interest in the Tranche&nbsp;B           Institutional Notes to such Participant
and (ii)&nbsp;to cause each such           Participant to be bound by a similar
restriction with respect to           sub-participations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, nothing in           this Section shall prevent or prohibit any Lender
from transferring, pledging or           assigning its rights under this Agreement (but
not its obligations hereunder to           make Loans or to issue or participate in
Letters of Credit) its Loans and Notes           to a Federal Reserve Bank.  </FONT></P>

agreements between Borrower and the Secured Parties whether now existing or hereafter
arising and whether written or oral, are hereby limited so that in no contingency, whether
by reason of acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness governed hereby or
otherwise, shall the interest contracted for or charged or received by the Secured Parties
exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable Law. If, from any circumstance
whatsoever, interest would otherwise be payable to the Secured Parties in excess of the
maximum lawful amount, the interest payable to the Secured Parties shall be reduced to the
maximum amount permitted under applicable Law, and the amount of interest for any
subsequent period, to the extent less than that permitted by applicable Law, shall to that
extent be increased by the amount of such reduction. If from any circumstance the Secured
Parties shall ever receive anything of value deemed interest by applicable Law in excess
of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal to any excessive interest shall be applied
to the reduction of the principal of the Loans or the Institutional Loans, as appropriate,
made hereunder or satisfaction of other Obligations and not to the payment of interest, or
if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal of the loans made
hereunder or unsatisfied amounts of remaining Obligations, such excess shall be refunded
to Borrower. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Secured Parties shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full period until payment in full of the Obligations (including the period
of any renewal or extension thereof) so that interest thereon for such full period shall
not exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable Law. This paragraph shall control
all agreements between Borrower and the Secured Parties. In determining whether or not any
interest payable under the Loan Instruments exceed the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Law, any non-principal payment, except payments specifically stated to be
&#147;interest&#148;, shall be deemed, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to be a
fee, expense, reimbursement or penalty rather than interest. </FONT></P>
