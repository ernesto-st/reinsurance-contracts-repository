such person holds were exercised, that possess 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or (ii)&nbsp;such right would cause such person to have purchase rights
under this Plan and all other stock purchase plans of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or Donegal Mutual that meet the requirements of Section&nbsp;423 of the Code, that accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of the
stock of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, determined at the time the right to purchase Class&nbsp;A common stock under this Plan is exercisable, for each calendar year in which a purchase right under this Plan is outstanding. For this
purpose, a right to purchase Class&nbsp;A common stock accrues when such right first becomes exercisable during the calendar year, but the rate of accrual for any calendar year may in no event exceed $25,000 of the fair market value of Class&nbsp;A
common stock subject to the right, and the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock under one right may not be carried over to any other right. </P>
