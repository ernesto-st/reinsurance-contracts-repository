Payment by the Subscribing Reinsurer of the amount of liability ascertained shall  constitute a complete and final release of both parties in respect of liability arising from the  Subscribing Reinsurer&#8217;s participation under this Contract.  D. The Company&#8217;s option to require commutation under paragraph C. above shall survive the  termination or expiration of this Contract.  </FONT></DIV>

ARTICLE 26  INSOLVENCY  A. If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of &#8220;Company&#8221; in the  Preamble to this Contract, this Article shall apply severally to each such company.  Further,  this Article and the laws of the domiciliary location shall apply in the event of the insolvency  of any company covered hereunder.

It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor  of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against  the Company indicating the Policy or bond reinsured, which claim would involve a possible  liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the  conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency  of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in  the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated any defense or defenses that it may  deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.   The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of  the court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the  extent of a pro rata share of the benefit that may accrue to the Company solely as a result of  the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

ARTICLE 27  ARBITRATION  A. Any dispute arising out of the interpretation, performance or breach of this Contract,  including the formation or validity thereof, shall be submitted for decision to a panel of three  arbitrators.  Notice requesting arbitration shall be in writing and sent certified or registered  mail, return receipt requested.  B. One arbitrator shall be chosen by each party and the two arbitrators shall then choose an  impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing.

C. If the two arbitrators do not agree on a third arbitrator within 60 days of their appointment,  the third arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the procedures for selecting the third  arbitrator in force on the date the arbitration is demanded, established by the AIDA  Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society &#8211; U.S. (ARIAS).

Within 30 days after all arbitrators have been appointed, the panel shall meet and determine  timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules of hearings.  E.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, the  arbitrators may at their discretion, consider underwriting and placement information  provided by the Company to the Reinsurer, as well as any correspondence exchanged by the  parties that is related to this Contract.  Unless the panel agrees otherwise, arbitration shall  take place in New York, New York, but the venue may be changed when deemed by the  panel to be in the best interest of the arbitration proceeding. Insofar as the arbitration panel  looks to substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of New York. The decision of  any two arbitrators when rendered in writing shall be final and binding.  The panel is  empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate.  F. The panel shall interpret this Contract as an honorable engagement rather than as merely a  legal obligation and shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the  applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible after the hearings.   Judgment upon an award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  G. Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with  the other party the cost of the third arbitrator.  The remaining costs of the arbitration shall be  allocated by the panel.  The panel may, at its discretion, award such further costs and  expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorneys&#8217; fees, to the extent  permitted by law.

This Article applies only to those Subscribing Reinsurers not domiciled in the United States  of America, and/or not authorized in any state, territory and/or district of the United States  of America where authorization is required by insurance regulatory authorities.  B. This Article shall not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to  arbitrate their disputes as provided for in the Arbitration Article.  This Article is intended as  an aid to compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or arbitral award, not as an  alternative to the Arbitration Article for resolving disputes arising out of this Contract.

In the event of the failure of the Reinsurer to perform its obligations hereunder, the Reinsurer,  at the request of the Company, shall submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent  jurisdiction within the United States.  Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be  understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer&#8217;s rights to commence an action in any  court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States  District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the  United States or of any state in the United States.
