The Issuer may freely refuse to provide such Agent with  this information and thus prevent such Agent from using these data-processing systems.  However, such a refusal will be an obstacle preventing the start or continuation of business  relations between the Issuer and such Agent. Such Agent will only ask for the information  needed to fulfil its obligations.  21.3 The Issuer expressly authorizes the transfer of data to third parties or to the head office of  each Agent (such as to a sub-custodian or any other person providing services to such Agent)  if such transmission is required to allow such Agent to provide its services to the Issuer or  to satisfy legal obligations it or such third party is subject to. The Issuer expressly authorizes  such transfer, including, to the extent relevant, any transfer to third parties established  outside the European Union.  22 COUNTERPARTS  22.1 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by the parties on  separate counterparts, but shall not be effective until each party has executed at least one  counterpart.  22.2 Each counterpart shall constitute an original of this Agreement, but all the counterparts shall  together constitute but one and the same instrument.

(c) Set-off: By acceptance of the Subordinated Notes and subject to applicable law, each  Noteholder will be deemed to have waived any right of set-off or counterclaim that  such Noteholder might otherwise have against the Issuer in respect of or arising under  the Subordinated Notes whether prior to or in any Winding-Up of the Issuer.

For the purposes of this Condition 2(e) (Solvency Condition), the Issuer will be solvent  if (i) it is able to pay its debts owed to creditors other than Junior Creditors as they fall  due and (ii) its Assets exceed its Liabilities. Should the Issuer consider itself not  solvent for the purpose of this Condition 2(e) (Solvency Condition), it will have to  produce a certificate as to the insolvency of the Issuer signed by two Authorised  Signatories or, if there is a Winding-Up or administration of the Issuer, by two  directors or authorised signatories of, the liquidator or, as the case may be, the  administrator of the Issuer shall be treated and accepted by the Issuer, the Noteholders  and all other interested parties as correct and sufficient evidence thereof and (in the  absence of manifest error or bad faith) shall be binding on all such persons.  3 REGISTER, TITLE AND TRANSFERS  (a) Register: The Registrar will maintain a register (the &#8220;Register&#8221;) in respect of the  Subordinated Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Paying Agency  Agreement.

In that event the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts as will  result in receipt by the Noteholders after such withholding or deduction of such amounts as  would have been received by them had no such withholding or deduction been required,  except that no such additional amounts shall be payable in respect of any Subordinated Note:  (a) held by a Noteholder which is liable to such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental  charges in respect of such Subordinated Note by reason of its having some connection  with Bermuda other than the mere holding of the Subordinated Note;   (b) where the present or future taxes, duties or governmental charges of whatever nature  imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed are so imposed, levied, collected or  withheld outside Bermuda on the income or gains of the relevant Noteholder; or  (c) where (in the case of a payment of principal or interest on redemption) the relevant  Note Certificate is surrendered for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date  except to the extent that the relevant Noteholder would have been entitled to such  additional amounts if it had surrendered the relevant Note Certificate on the last day  of such period of 30 days.

(b) Winding-Up: Upon the Winding-Up of the Issuer (or other equivalent proceedings),  the Subordinated Notes shall automatically become due and payable at their  outstanding principal amount together with interest (including Arrears of Interest and  Additional Interest Amounts) (if any) accrued to such date and the claim in respect  thereof will be subject to the subordination provided for in Condition 2 (Status of the  Subordinated Notes). In addition, any other amounts in respect of the Subordinated  Notes (including any damages awarded for breach of any obligations under these  Conditions in respect of which the Solvency Condition was not satisfied on the date  upon which the same would otherwise have become due and payable (&#8220;Solvency  Claims&#8221;) will be payable by the Issuer in a Winding-Up or administration of the Issuer,  and the claim in respect thereof will be subject to the subordination provided for in  Condition 2 (Status of the Subordinated Notes).
