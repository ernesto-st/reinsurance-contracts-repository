at least seven days advance written notice of any meeting at which the Board
proposes to put forward for a vote a decision on whether or not to terminate
the Employee for Cause and the written notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the basis on which the Board may conclude that Cause exists. The
Employee shall have the opportunity to appear in person and to make such
written and/or oral presentation to such meeting of the Board as the Employee
thinks necessary. If a majority of the Board authorizes by affirmative vote a
termination for Cause at such meeting (whether or not the Employee makes any
oral or written presentations at such meeting) such determination shall be
effective once such decision is confirmed in writing and communicated to the
Employee. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;Cause&#148; shall mean any one or
more of the following: (A) any failure or inability (other than by reason of
physical or mental disability determined in accordance with Section 3(b)(i)) of
the Employee to perform his material duties under this Agreement to the
satisfaction of at least a majority of the members of the Board, including,
without limitation, any refusal by the Employee to perform such duties or to
perform such specific directives of the Chief Executive Officer which are consistent
with the scope and nature of the Employee&#146;s duties and responsibilities under
this Agreement; (B) any intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or theft by the
Employee in connection with his duties hereunder or in the course of his
employment hereunder or the Employee&#146;s admission or conviction of, or plea of
nolo contender to, a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, fraud,
embezzlement, theft or misrepresentation; (C) any gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Employee in connection with his duties hereunder or during
the course of his employment that results in a monetary loss to the Company, or
damage to the reputation of the Company; (D) any breach by the Employee of any
one or more of the covenants contained in Section 4 or 6 hereof; or (E) any
violation of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries in connection with his duties hereunder or during the
course of his employment. The exercise of the right of the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 3(b)(iii) shall not abrogate the rights
or remedies of the Company in respect of the breach giving rise to such
termination.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Recitals</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aon Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation with
its executive headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, and its subsidiaries and
affiliates (and divisions thereof) including the Company (collectively &#147;Aon Group&#148;)
are in the business of providing conventional and alternative risk management
products and services covering the businesses of insurance brokerage,
reinsurance brokerage, benefits consulting, compensation consulting human
resources consulting, managing underwriting and related insurance services,
including accounting, claims management and handling, contract wording,
information systems and actuarial (the &#147;Business&#148;) as well as soliciting and
servicing the insurance and reinsurance needs of numerous commercial and
individual clients which are national and international and are not confined to
any geographic area. An essential element of the Business is the development
and maintenance of personal contacts and relationships with clients. Because of
these contacts and relationships, it is common for Aon Group&#146;s clients to
develop an identification with the employee who serves its insurance needs
rather than with Aon Group itself. Aon Group, however, invests considerable
time and money necessary for a relationship between its employee and a client
to develop and be maintained, in that Aon Group pays the employee&#146;s salary and
reimburses the employee for business expenses. Aon Group also assists </font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:60.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The personal
identification of clients of Aon Group with an Aon Group employee creates the
potential for the employee&#146;s appropriation of the benefits of the relationships
developed with clients on behalf of and at the expense of Aon Group. Since Aon
Group would suffer irreparable harm if an employee left the Company&#146;s employ
and solicited the insurance or other related business of clients of the Company
and Aon Group, it is reasonable to protect the Company and Aon Group against
solicitation activities by an employee for a limited period of time after an
employee leaves the Company so that Aon Group may renew or restore its business
relationship with its clients.</font></p>

of Arbitration.</font></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as provided below, the parties

all disputes arising from or related to the employment relationship created by
this Agreement and any other disputes between the parties arising from or
related to their employment relationship and alleging common law tort
violations or violations of state or federal statutory rights. The parties

hereunder in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, the parties agree to waive all
statutes of limitations that might otherwise be applicable and agree further
that, as to any dispute that can be brought hereunder, a demand for arbitration
must be postmarked or delivered in person to the other party no later than one

demand for arbitration, an arbitrator has no authority to resolve the disputes
or render an award and no arbitrator has authority hereunder to determine the
timeliness of an arbitration demand.</p>

a written demand for arbitration, containing a statement of the matter to be

qualified arbitrators and repeat the selection process. If the parties remain
unable to select an arbitrator, then they shall request from AAA a third panel
of three comparably qualified arbitrators, from which the AAA shall reject the

either, upon accepting assignment as arbitrator, (i) promptly conduct a
preliminary hearing or (ii) require the submission of written statements, or
both, in which event, each party shall be entitled to make a brief statement of
their respective positions, and at which time the arbitrator shall establish a
timetable for prehearing activities and the conduct of the hearing, and may
address initial requests from the parties for prehearing disclosure of
information. At the preliminary hearing and/or thereafter, arbitrator shall
have the discretion and authority to order, upon request or otherwise, the prehearing
disclosure of information to the parties, including, without limitation,
production of requested documents, exchange of witness lists and summaries of
the testimony of proposed witnesses, and examination by deposition of potential
