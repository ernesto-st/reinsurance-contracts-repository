such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code or the regulations issued thereunder, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with
respect to a portion of any such sums paid or payable to such Lender. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances
renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form&nbsp;W-8ECI or W-8BEN, or Form&nbsp;W-8 and a Foreign Lender Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in
order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note or
any Guarantee, or it shall immediately notify Borrower and Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any
such form or certificate pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.06(b) for so long as such payments may be made free from United States withholding tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be
required to deliver any such form or certificate if a change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred prior to the date on which such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any such form
or certificate inapplicable or would prevent the Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or certificate with respect to it and such Lender so advises Borrower. No Credit Party shall
be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender, or to pay any additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of any Covered Taxes to the extent that the obligation to pay
such Covered Taxes would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U.S. Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;5.06(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section&nbsp;5.06, Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section&nbsp;5.06(a) (without regard to the identity of the
jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes after the
Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of Covered Taxes. </FONT></P>

Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.06 agrees to use (at the Credit Parties' expense) reasonable efforts (consistent
with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such change would avoid the need for, or in the opinion of
such Lender materially reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. </FONT></P>

credited by such Governmental Authority or otherwise gives rise to a claim of credit that is actually claimed, and will not be required to be repaid to such Governmental Authority or otherwise
disallowed, then Administrative Agent or such Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to notify Borrower of such Tax Benefit and to forward the proceeds of such Tax Benefit (or relevant portion
thereof) to Borrower as reduced by any expense or liability incurred by Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with obtaining such Tax Benefit. </FONT></P>

Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Creditor thereof upon this guarantee or acceptance of this guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall

been had or consummated in reliance upon this guarantee. This guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of
offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or from time to time held by the Creditors, and the obligations and liabilities of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be
conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Creditors or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against Borrower or against any other person which may be or become liable in respect
of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. This guarantee shall remain in full force and effect

automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of Borrower or other Credit Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and
severally agree that they will indemnify each Creditor on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by such Creditor in connection with such
rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, other than any costs or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or bad faith of such Creditor. </FONT></P>

to such Subsidiary Guarantor until the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall prior to the

irrevocably appoints Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to Administrative Agent by
the terms hereof and the Security Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent agrees to give promptly to each Lender a copy of each
notice or other document received by it pursuant to any Credit Document (other than any that are required to be delivered to the Lenders by any Credit Party). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the
Majority Lenders may replace Administrative Agent at any time in the event of willful misconduct or gross negligence by Administrative Agent in the administration of the duties and obligations
expressly authorized herein as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by Section&nbsp;13.04), and (c)&nbsp;except as expressly set forth herein, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the

shall be required by Section&nbsp;13.04) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written
notice thereof is given to Administrative Agent and such Agent by Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)&nbsp;any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Credit Document, (ii)&nbsp;the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Credit

proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by
it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as
the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or

way that it is funding the portion of such Loan, L/C Interests and Commitments in which no participations have been sold. In no event shall a Lender that sells a participation agree with the
Participant to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or under any other Credit Document, except that such Lender may agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any modification or amendment set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III)&nbsp;or (VIII)&nbsp;of clause&nbsp;(a) of the proviso to Section&nbsp;13.04(i)&nbsp;to the extent
