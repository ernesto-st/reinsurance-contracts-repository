Tax (without duplication of other payments made with respect to any such Tax), the amount thereof

its Subsidiaries to deposit or cause to be deposited promptly, and in any event no later than the
first Business Day after the date of receipt thereof, all cash, checks, drafts or other similar

each Lender maintaining a Cash Collateral Account, at the direction of the Administrative Agent,
shall promptly remit all funds in the Cash Collateral Account maintained by such Lender to a Cash
Collateral Account maintained at SunTrust as the Administrative Agent shall designate. Without
limiting the foregoing, for so long as an Event of Default exists, all sums held in a Cash
Collateral Account may be held in cash or may be invested in such Permitted Investments as the
Administrative Agent alone may elect. Neither of the Borrowers nor any Person claiming on behalf
of or through a Borrower shall have any right to demand payment of any funds held in any Cash
Collateral Account at any time prior to the termination of all outstanding Letters of Credit, the

Revolving Credit Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be
authorized to apply all funds and Permitted Investments in a Cash Collateral Account as provided
in <U>Section&nbsp;2.24(b)</U> and the Loan Documents.

for such deposit account is a Lender that has entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. As of the Closing Date, all bank accounts of
any nature of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries are listed on <U>Schedule&nbsp;5.6</U> and such

records of its Inventory (including records showing the cost thereof and daily withdrawals
therefrom and additions thereto) and shall furnish the Collateral Agent inventory reports
respecting such Inventory in form and detail satisfactory to the Collateral Agent at such times as
the Collateral Agent may request, but so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, no more frequently than once each week unless the Collateral Agent shall elect to
receive such reports on a more frequent basis (provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
certain items noted in <U>Schedule&nbsp;IV</U>, shall only be updated on a weekly basis). Each
Borrower shall, at its own expense, conduct a physical inventory no less frequently than annually
(and on a more frequent basis if requested by the Collateral Agent when an Event of Default
exists) and periodic cycle counts consistent with such Borrower&#146;s historical practices and shall
provide to
the Collateral Agent a report based on each such physical inventory and cycle count promptly
after completion thereof, together with such supporting information as the Collateral Agent shall
request. The Agents may participate in and observe each physical count or inventory, which

Business of such Borrower and such Person; (ii)&nbsp;no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
or would result therefrom; (iii)&nbsp;the return of such Inventory will not result in an Out-of-Formula
Condition; (iv)&nbsp;such Borrower promptly notifies the Collateral Agent thereof if the aggregate
value of all Inventory returned in any month exceeds $1,500,000; and (v)&nbsp;any payments received by
such Borrower in connection with any such return are promptly turned over to the Administrative
Agent for application to the Obligations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Acquisitions and Sale of Inventory</U>. No Borrower shall acquire or accept any
Inventory on consignment or approval. No Borrower shall sell any Inventory to any customer on
approval or any other basis upon which the customer has a right to return (except if
non-conforming) or obligates any Borrower to repurchase such Inventory.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Maintenance of Inventory</U>. Borrowers shall produce, use, store and maintain all
Inventory with all reasonable care and caution in accordance with applicable standards of any
insurance and in conformity with Applicable Law (including the requirements of the FLSA) and will
maintain current rent payments (within applicable grace periods provided for in leases) at all
locations at which any Inventory is maintained or stored.
