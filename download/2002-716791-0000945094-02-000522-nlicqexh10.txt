                                   BETWEEN THE

             NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                           (HEREINAFTER "NORTHBROOK")

                                       AND

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")


                                   Article I.

                              BASIS OF REINSURANCE

1.   One-hundred percent (100%) of the net benefits (defined in Article II,
     Paragraph 1), under all eligible policies (defined in Schedule A) of
     NORTHBROOK, will be reinsured with ALLSTATE.

2.   This reinsurance will be ceded to ALLSTATE on an automatic coinsurance
     basis.

3.   In no event will reinsurance under this Agreement be in force unless the
     corresponding policy issued by NORTHBROOK or the reinsurance accepted by
     NORTHBROOK is in force.

                                   Article II.

                              REINSURANCE BENEFITS

1.   Net benefits are defined as follows:

     (a)  For a policy issued directly by NORTHBROOK and reinsured under this
          Agreement, net benefits are the actual amounts payable by NORTHBROOK
          to the policyholder, less any amounts payable to NORTHBROOK by another
          reinsurer with respect to the policy. These payments include death
          benefits, endowment benefits, annuity benefits, disability benefits,
          benefits under A & H policies, surrender benefits and payments on
          supplementary contracts with and without life contingencies.

     (b)  For policies reinsured by NORTHBROOK and retroceded under this
          Agreement, net benefits are the actual amounts payable by NORTHBROOK
          to the ceding company with respect to the policy reinsured by
          NORTHBROOK. These payments will include commissions and expense
          allowances on reinsurance accepted.

2.   With respect to policies issued directly or reinsured by NORTHBROOK on or
     prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, ALLSTATE's liability for net
     benefits will begin on the first day following the Agreement's Effective
     Date. This liability will include net benefits incurred on or prior to the
     Effective Date of this Agreement, but not paid until after the Agreement's
     Effective Date.

3.   With respect to policies issued directly or reinsured by NORTHBROOK after
     the Effective Date of this Agreement, ALLSTATE's liability for net benefits
     will begin simultaneously with that of NORTHBROOK and will include any
     liability NORTHBROOK may incur as a result of a Temporary Insurance
     Agreement or Conditional Receipt issued in conjunction with a policy
     subject to this Agreement.

4.   ALLSTATE's liability under this Agreement will continue as long as
     NORTHBROOK remains liable on the underlying coverage, and will terminate
     simultaneously with NORTHBROOK's termination of liability.

                                  Article III.

                                RESERVE TRANSFERS

1.   On or before the Effective Date of this Agreement, NORTHBROOK shall pay to
     ALLSTATE one million dollars ($1,000,000) in cash.

2.   Within one-hundred and eighty (180) days following the Effective Date of
     this Agreement, NORTHBROOK shall pay to ALLSTATE assets with statutory book
     value equal to (a) less (b), where (a) and (b) are as defined below.
     NORTHBROOK shall also pay to ALLSTATE interest on this amount; such amount
     being equal to the sum of (c) and (d), as defined below.

     (a)  Net statutory reserves determined as the portion of the following
          items (i) through (viii), minus items (ix) through (xi) attributable
          to the policies (or portion of such policies) ceded to ALLSTATE under
          this Agreement. The applicable portion of these items will be
          calculated as of the Effective Date of this Agreement and will be
          based on the corresponding items from NORTHBROOK's General Account
          statutory financial statement as filed with the Illinois Insurance
          Department.

     both NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE shall be restored to the positions they would

                              INSPECTION OF RECORDS

     NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE shall have the right, at any reasonable time, to
     examine at the office of the other, any books, documents, reports or
     records which pertain in any way to the policies reinsured under this
     Agreement.

                                   Article IX.

                                   INSOLVENCY

1.   In the event of the insolvency of NORTHBROOK, reinsurance hereunder is
     payable by ALLSTATE on the basis of its liability hereunder without
     diminution because of the insolvency of NORTHBROOK.

2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of NORTHBROOK, the liquidator,
     receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent NORTHBROOK shall give
     written notice to ALLSTATE of the pendency of an obligation of the
     insolvent NORTHBROOK on any policy reinsured, whereupon ALLSTATE may
     investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the proceeding
     where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may
     deem available to NORTHBROOK or its liquidator or statutory successor. The
     expense thus incurred by ALLSTATE shall be chargeable, subject to court
     approval, against the insolvent NORTHBROOK as part of the expenses of
     liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may
     accrue to NORTHBROOK solely as a result of the defense undertaken by
     ALLSTATE.

3.   All monies due NORTHBROOK or ALLSTATE under this Agreement shall be offset
     against each other, dollar for dollar, regardless of any insolvency of
     either party.

                                   Article X.

                                   ARBITRATION

     Any dispute arising with respect to this Agreement which is not settled by
     mutual agreement of the parties shall be referred to arbitration. Within
     twenty (20) days from receipt of written notice from one party that an
     arbitrator has been appointed, the other party will also name an
     arbitrator. The two arbitrators will choose a third arbitrator and will
     forthwith notify the contracting parties of such choice. Each arbitrator
     should be a present or former officer of a life insurance company and
     should have no present or past affiliation with this Agreement or with
     either party. The arbitrators will consider this Agreement as an honorable
     engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation, and will be relieved
     of all judicial formalities. The decision of the arbitrators will be final
     and binding upon the parties hereto. Each party shall bear the expenses of
     its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear the expenses of the
     third arbitrator and of the arbitration. Any such arbitration will take
     place at the Home Office of NORTHBROOK, unless some other location is
     mutually agreed upon.

                                   Article XI.

                              PARTIES TO AGREEMENT

     This Agreement is solely between NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE. The acceptance of
     reinsurance hereunder does not create any right or legal relation whatever
     between ALLSTATE and any party in interest under any policy reinsured
     hereunder. NORTHBROOK shall be and remain solely liable to any insured,
     contract owner, or beneficiary under any policy reinsured hereunder.

                              DURATION OF AGREEMENT

     This Agreement will be effective as of December 31, 1987, and will be
     unlimited as to its duration; provided, however, it may be terminated with
     respect to the reinsurance of new business by either party giving sixty
     (60) days prior written notice of termination to the other party.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties to this Agreement have caused it to be duly
executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the date shown below.

                                   between the

             NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Northbrook, Illinois
                           (hereinafter "NORTHBROOK")

                                        and

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Northbrook, Illinois

               (a)  For an application received, or a policy issued directly by
                    NORTHBROOK and reinsured under this Agreement, net benefits
                    are the actual amounts payable by NORTHBROOK to the
                    policyholder, less any amounts payable to NORTHBROOK by
                    another reinsurer with respect to the policy. These payments
                    include death benefits, endowment benefits, annuity

               directly or reinsured by NORTHBROOK, after the Effective Date of
               this Agreement, ALLSTATE's liability for net benefits will begin
               simultaneously with that of NORTHBROOK and will include any
               liability NORTHBROOK may incur as a result of a Temporary
               Insurance Agreement or Conditional Receipt issued in conjunction
               with a policy subject to this Agreement.

     2.   Article IV of the Coinsurance Agreement, is deleted, and replaced with
new Article IV set out below:

                                     to the

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     between

             NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Northbrook, Illinois
                           (hereinafter "NORTHBROOK")

                                       and

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Northbrook, Illinois
                            (hereinafter "ALLSTATE")

     IT IS HEREBY AGREED that the 100% Coinsurance Reinsurance Agreement
effective December 31, 1987, between NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE is amended as
follows:

1. A new Article VIII is added, to read as follows:

                                  Article VIII

                          CONVERSION TO FUNDS WITHHELD

           (a.) Effective on the date and at the time of transfer of all or
     substantially all Assets to NORTHBROOK pursuant to Section 6(f) of the
     Security and Trust Agreement among the parties hereto, Dean Witter
     Reynolds, Inc., and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, the reinsurance
     hereunder provided shall convert from an automatic coinsurance basis to a
     funds withheld basis. The delivery to the Trustee of the Instructions for
     Release to Beneficiary, as provided in Section 6(f) of the Security and
     Trust Agreement, shall operate as notice to NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE of such
     conversion. NORTHBROOK shall hold all assets received pursuant to such
     transfer, including subsequent additions and investment income, under the
     Funds Withheld provisions of this Article.

<Page>

           (b.) In the event of a conversion, as provided in Section (a.) of
     this Article VIII, from an automatic coinsurance to a funds withheld basis,
     Article IV, MONTHLY SETTLEMENTS, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to this
     Reinsurance Agreement, shall be automatically modified to operate as
     follows:

     (i)   In addition to the settlements described in Article IV, which shall
           continue, NORTHBROOK shall pay to ALLSTATE no less frequently than
           weekly the net investment income, including all realized capital
           gains and losses, earned on the assets held in accordance with
           Section (a) of this Article VIII.

     (ii)  Notwithstanding the requirements of Article IV and Section (b) (i) of
           this Article VIII, NORTHBROOK shall withhold from ALLSTATE and hold
           an amount not greater than the sum A, B and C below, such sum
           hereafter referred to as the "Funds Withheld"

           A.   an amount equal to the net statutory reserves in respect of the
                business reinsured;

           B.   an amount equal to the Interest Maintenance Reserve related to
                the Assets held in trust in accordance with Section (a) of this
                Article VIII;

           C.   an amount not greater at any time than 20% of the net statutory
                reserves with respect to the business reinsured, equal to the
                accumulation, if positive, of the amounts due ALLSTATE from
                NORTHBROOK less the amounts due NORTHBROOK from ALLSTATE,
                beginning from the date Assets are transferred to NORTHBROOK
                pursuant to Section 6(f) of the Security and Trust Agreement.

     (iii) The net periodic settlements described in Article IV shall be
           adjusted to provide for Funds Withheld by reducing the amount paid to
           ALLSTATE by any increase in the Funds Withheld for the settlement
           period or increasing the amount paid ALLSTATE by any decrease in the
           Funds Withheld.

     (c)   Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII,
     NORTHBROOK shall at all times have the right to use any Assets in its
     possession for the payment of benefits due and owing under policies issued
     by NORTHBROOK.

                                        2

2.   This Reinsurance Agreement is amended further by renumbering current
Article VIII to be Article IX, and each subsequent Article is renumbered
consecutively from such new Article IX.

3.   This Reinsurance Agreement is amended further by deleting current Article
XII, entitled DURATION OF AGREEMENT, and inserting, in its place, the following:

                                  ARTICLE XIII.

read as follows:

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     BETWEEN

             NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                           (HEREINAFTER "NORTHBROOK")

                                       AND
              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")


WHEREAS, Northbrook and Allstate entered into a Coinsurance Agreement
(hereinafter "Agreement") having an effective date of December 31, 1987; and,

WHEREAS, the California Insurance Department has determined that various changes
to the Agreement are required under California insurance law; and,

WHEREAS, Northbrook and Allstate desire to amend the Agreement with respect to
coverage issued to California residents to meet the California requirements;

NOW THEREFORE, the Agreement is hereby amended with respect to California
residents, as follows;

     1.)  Article IX, "INSOLVENCY", is hereby amended by deleting said Article
in its entirety, and replacing it with the following new Article IX.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   INSOLVENCY

     1.   The portion of any risk or obligation assumed by Allstate, when such
          portion is ascertained, shall be payable on demand of Northbrook at
          the same time as Northbrook shall pay its net retained portion of such
          risk or obligation, and the reinsurance shall be payable by Allstate
          on the basis of the liability of Northbrook under the contract or
          contracts reinsured under this Agreement without diminution because of
          the insolvency of Northbrook. In the event of insolvency and the
          appointment of a conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of
          Northbrook, such portion shall be payable to such conservator,
          liquidator or statutory successor immediately upon demand, on the
          basis of claims

<Page>

          allowed against Northbrook by any court of competent jurisdiction or,
          by any conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of Northbrook
          having authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of
          such insolvency or because such conservator, liquidator or statutory
          successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Payments
          by Allstate as above set forth shall be made directly to Northbrook or
          its conservator, liquidator or statutory successor.

     2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of Northbrook, the liquidator,
          receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent Northbrook shall give
          written notice to Allstate of the pendency of an obligation of the
          insolvent Northbrook on any policy reinsured, whereupon Allstate may
          investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the
          proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or
          defenses which it may deem available to Northbrook or its liquidator
          or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by Allstate shall be
          chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent
          Northbrook as part of the expenses of liquidation to the extent of a
          proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Northbrook
          solely as a result of the defense undertaken by Allstate

     2.)  Article X, ARBITRATION, shall be amended to include the following
     language at the end of that article:

          The decision of the Arbitrators shall be handed down within
          45 days of the date on which the arbitration is concluded.

     3.)  Article XII, PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT, shall be deleted in its
     entirety and shall be replaced with the following language:

          This Agreement shall be effective as of December 31, 1987,
          and will be unlimited as to its duration; provided, however,
          it may be terminated with respect to the reinsurance of new
          business by either party giving the other party ninety (90)
          days prior written notice of termination to the other party.

     4.)  Article VII, paragraph 1(c) as amended in Amendment No. 2 shall be
     deleted in its entirety and shall be replaced with the following language:

          (c)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article
          VII, NORTHBROOK shall at all times have the right to use any Assets in
          its possession for the payment of benefits due and owing under
          policies issued by NORTHBROOK. Provided, however, NORTHBROOK will not
          use any such Assets to satisfy any liabilities under the Northbrook
          Separate Account.

<Page>

     5.)  In addition, a new Article XIII is added to the Agreement, as follows:

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     OFFSET

     All monies due Northbrook or Allstate under this Agreement shall
     be offset against each other dollar for dollar.

     6.)  Further, a new Article XIV is added to the agreement, as follows:

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                ENTIRE AGREEMENT

     This Agreement constitutes the entire contract between ALLSTATE
     and NORTHBROOK. No variation, modification or changes to this
     Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by an
     officer of each party.

This Amendment shall be effective on June 12, 1995. Except as amended hereby,
the Agreement shall remain unchanged.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties to the Agreement have caused this Amendment to
be duly executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the dates shown

                          TO THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT
                           EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 1987

                                     BETWEEN

                        NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
                        (HEREINAFTER CALLED "NORTHBROOK")

                                       AND

                         ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
                         (HEREINAFTER CALLED "ALLSTATE")

WHEREAS, NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE entered into a Reinsurance Agreement effective
December 31, 1987 (hereinafter "Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the parties now believe that the Agreement does not accurately reflect
their existing practices relating to settlements for certain tax benefits and
liabilities; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Agreement to reflect the existing
practices with respect to such tax settlements;

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED, that the Agreement is amended as provided
below.

     1.) Article IV, paragraph 2, is amended by replacing subparagraph (d) with
        a new subparagraph (d), as follows:

          (d)  Insurance taxes, licenses and fees (excluding Federal Income Tax
          that is not related to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement),
          incurred by NORTHBROOK with respect to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement.

     2.) Article IV is further amended by adding a new paragraph 3, as follows:

          3.   No less frequently than quarterly, ALLSTATE will calculate the
          amount of federal and state income tax liabilities incurred by

                                   Page 1 of 2
<Page>

          NORTHBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement, and the amount of federal and state income tax
          benefits earned by NORTHBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts
          reinsured under this Agreement. If tax liabilities exceed tax
          benefits, the difference, plus a gross-up for additional federal and
          state income taxes, will be paid by ALLSTATE to NORTHBROOK. If tax
          benefits exceed tax liabilities, the difference, plus a gross-up for
          additional federal and state income taxes, will be paid by NORTHBROOK
          to ALLSTATE.

Except as amended hereby, the Agreement shall remain unchanged.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties to the Agreement have caused this Amendment to be

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     BETWEEN

             NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                           (HEREINAFTER "NORTHBROOK")

                                       AND

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")

                                    Article I

                              BASIS OF REINSURANCE

1.   ALLSTATE will indemnify and NORTHBROOK will automatically reinsure with
     ALLSTATE, according to the terms and conditions hereof, the net liability
     for contracts in force (or no longer in force but with remaining liability)
     on the Effective Date and contracts directly issued subsequent to the
     Effective Date by NORTHBROOK on the contracts listed in Schedule A.

2.   The indemnity reinsurance provided hereunder shall be on a modified
     coinsurance basis. NORTHBROOK shall retain, maintain, and own all assets
     held in relation to the Reserve, as defined in Article III.

3.   In no event will reinsurance under this Agreement be in force with respect
     to a contract of NORTHBROOK unless such contract is in force.

                                   Article II

                              LIABILITY OF ALLSTATE

The liability of ALLSTATE with respect to any contract reinsured hereunder will
begin simultaneously with that of NORTHBROOK, but not prior to the Effective
Date of this Agreement. ALLSTATES'S liability with respect to any contract
reinsured hereunder will terminate on the date NORTHBROOK's liability on such
contract terminates or the date this Agreement is terminated, whichever is
earliest. However, termination of this Agreement will not terminate ALLSTATE's
liability for benefit payments incurred prior to the date of termination.

     this Article III, as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, with respect

     liability for the reinsured contracts corresponding to the sum of the
     amounts on page 3, line 18 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory Separate Account
     (excluding Variable Life) Statement and page 3, line 12 of NORTHBROOK's
     Statutory Variable Life Separate Account Statement.

                               MONTHLY SETTLEMENTS

1.   Within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month in which
     this Agreement is in effect, NORTHBROOK shall pay to ALLSTATE, with respect
     to contracts reinsured under this Agreement, a reinsurance premium equal to

     Items (a), (b), (c) and (d) below.

     (a)  Net benefits (as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Article IV) paid by
          NORTHBROOK during the month with respect to the contracts reinsured

<Page>

3.   Net Benefits are defined as follows:

     (a)  For a contract issued directly by NORTHBROOK and reinsured under this
          Agreement, net benefits are the actual amounts payable by NORTHBROOK
          to the policyholder, less any amounts payable to NORTHBROOK by another
          reinsurer with respect to the contract. These payments include death
          benefits, endowment benefits, annuity benefits, disability benefits,
          benefits under A & H policies, surrender benefits and payments on
          supplementary contracts with and without life contingencies.

     (b)  For contracts reinsured by NORTHBROOK and retroceded under this
          Agreement, net benefits are the actual amounts payable by NORTHBROOK
          to the ceding company with respect to the contract reinsured by
          NORTHBROOK. These payments will include commissions and expense
          allowances on reinsurance accepted.

                                    Article V

                           MONTHLY RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS

1.   Simultaneously with the payment of the initial consideration described in
     Article III, Paragraph 1, ALLSTATE will pay to NORTHBROOK an initial
     reserve adjustment in an amount that is equal to the Reserve on the
     Effective Date of this Agreement with respect to the contracts reinsured
     hereunder.

2.   Within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month in which
     this Agreement is in effect, a reserve adjustment equal to (or the
     accounting equivalent of) the amount defined below shall be paid.

     Let:

          RC = The Reserve change from the end of the prior accounting period to
               the end of the current accounting period for the reinsured
               contracts corresponding to the sum of the amounts on page 4,
               lines 9, 10, 10A and 11 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory Separate
               Account (excluding Variable Life) Statement and page 4, lines 14
               and 15 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory Variable Life Separate Account
               Statement.

          NII = The net investment income corresponding to the sum of the
                amounts on page 4, line 2 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory Separate
                Account (excluding Variable Life) Statement and page 4, lines 4
                and 5 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory Variable Life Separate Account
                Statement.

     If RC is greater than NII then a reserve adjustment of RC-NII is payable by
     ALLSTATE to NORTHBROOK.

     If NII is greater than RC, then a reserve adjustment of NII-RC is payable
     by NORTHBROOK to ALLSTATE.

                                   Article VI

                              STATEMENT REFERENCES

All references in this Agreement are to the 1986 NAIC Statutory General and
Separate Account Statements of NORTHBROOK, as filed with the Illinois Insurance
Department. Appropriate adjustments will be made for changes, if any, in the
NAIC Statutory General and Separate Account Statements on or after the Effective
Date.

                                   Article VII

                                   OVERSIGHTS

ALLSTATE shall be bound as NORTHBROOK is bound, and it is expressly understood
and agreed that if failure to reinsure or failure to comply with any terms of
this Agreement is shown to be unintentional and the result of misunderstanding
or oversight on the part of either NORTHBROOK or ALLSTATE, both NORTHBROOK and
ALLSTATE shall be restored to the positions they would have occupied had no such
error or oversight occurred.

                                  Article VIII

                              INSPECTION OF RECORDS

NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE shall have the right, at any reasonable time, to examine
at the office of the other, any books, documents, reports or records which
pertain in any way to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement.

                                   Article IX

                                   INSOLVENCY

1.   In the event of the insolvency of NORTHBROOK, reinsurance hereunder is
     payable by ALLSTATE on the basis of its liability hereunder without
     diminution because of the insolvency of NORTHBROOK.

2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of NORTHBROOK, the liquidator,
     receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent NORTHBROOK shall give
     written notice to ALLSTATE of the pendency of any obligation of the
     insolvent NORTHBROOK on any policy reinsured, whereupon ALLSTATE may
     investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the proceeding
     where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may
     deem available to NORTHBROOK or its liquidator or statutory successor. The
     expense thus incurred by ALLSTATE shall be chargeable, subject to court
     approval, against the insolvent NORTHBROOK as part of the expenses of
     liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may
     accrue to NORTHBROOK solely as a result of the defense undertaken by
     ALLSTATE.

3.   All moneys due NORTHBROOK or ALLSTATE under this agreement shall be offset
     against each other, dollar for dollar, regardless of any insolvency of
     either party.

                                    Article X

                                   ARBITRATION

Any dispute arising with respect to this Agreement which is not settled by
mutual agreement of the parties shall be referred to arbitration. Within

                                   Page 4 of 6
<Page>

twenty (20) days from receipt of written notice from one party that an
arbitrator has been appointed, the other party shall also name an arbitrator.
The two arbitrators shall choose a third arbitrator and shall forthwith notify
the contracting parties of such choice. Each arbitrator shall be a present or
former officer of a life insurance company and should have no present or past
affiliation with this Agreement or with either party. The arbitrators shall
consider this Agreement as a honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal
obligation, and shall be relieved of all judicial formalities. The decision of
the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. Each party
shall bear the expenses of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear
the expenses of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration. Any such
arbitration shall take place at the Home Office of NORTHBROOK, unless some other
location is mutually agreed upon.

                                   Article XI

                              PARTIES TO AGREEMENT

This Agreement is solely between NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE. The acceptance of
reinsurance hereunder shall not create any right or legal relation whatever
between ALLSTATE and any party in interest under any contract of NORTHBROOK
reinsured hereunder. NORTHBROOK shall be and remain solely liable to any
insured, contract owner, or beneficiary under any contract reinsured hereunder.

This Agreement will be effective as of December 31, 1987, and will be unlimited
as to its duration; provided, however, it may be terminated with respect to the
reinsurance of new business by either party giving the other party sixty (60)
days prior written notice of termination to the other party.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties to this Agreement have caused it to be duly
executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the dates shown below.

               (d)  Insurance taxes, licenses and fees (excluding Federal Income
                    Tax) incurred by NORTHBROOK with respect to the contracts
                    reinsured under this Agreement.

     2.   Article IV is further amended by adding new sub-paragraph 4 set out
below:

          4.   Allstate shall pay to NORTHBROOK, no less frequently than
               annually, any taxes incurred by NORTHBROOK as a result of Section
               848 of the Internal Revenue Code which concerns capitalization of
               policy acquisition costs.

     3.   Article V, paragraph 2, is deleted, and replaced with the following
new paragraph 2:

          2.   While this Agreement is in effect, on a daily basis a reserve
               adjustment equal to (or the accounting equivalent of) the amount
               defined below shall be paid.

          Let:

               RC =  The Reserve change from the end of the prior accounting
                     period to the end of the current accounting period for
                     the reinsured contracts corresponding to the sum of
                     the amounts on page 4, lines 10, 11, 12 and 13 of
                     NORTHBROOK's Statutory Separate Account (excluding
                     Variable Life) Statement.

               NII = The net investment income corresponding to the sum of the
                     amounts on page 4, line 2 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory
                     Separate Account (excluding Variable Life) Statement,
                     minus interest income on NORTHBROOK's capital
                     investment.

          If RC is greater than NII then a reserve adjustment of RC-NII is
          payable by ALLSTATE to NORTHBROOK.

          If NII is greater than RC, then a reserve adjustment of NII-RC is
          payable by NORTHBROOK to ALLSTATE.

     This Amendment shall be effective as of September 1, 1990.

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     BETWEEN

             NORTHBROOK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                           (HEREINAFTER "NORTHBROOK")

                                       AND

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")


WHEREAS, Northbrook and Allstate entered into a Modified Coinsurance Agreement
(hereinafter "Agreement") having an effective date of December 31, 1987; and,

WHEREAS, the California Insurance Department has determined that various changes
to the Agreement are required under California insurance law; and,

WHEREAS, Northbrook and Allstate desire to amend the Agreement with respect to
coverage issued to California residents to meet the California requirements;

NOW THEREFORE, the Agreement is hereby amended with respect to California
residents, as follows;


     1.) Article IX, "INSOLVENCY", is hereby amended by deleting said Article in
its entirety, and replacing it with the following new Article IX.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   INSOLVENCY

     1.   The portion of any risk or obligation assumed by Allstate, when such
          portion is ascertained, shall be payable on demand of Northbrook at
          the same time as Northbrook shall pay its net retained portion of such
          risk or obligation, and the reinsurance shall be payable by Allstate
          on the basis of the liability of Northbrook under the contract or
          contracts reinsured under this Agreement without diminution because of
          the insolvency of Northbrook. In the event of insolvency and the
          appointment of a conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of
          Northbrook, such portion shall be payable to such conservator,
          liquidator or statutory successor immediately upon demand, on the
          basis of claims

<Page>

          allowed against Northbrook by any court of competent jurisdiction or,
          by any conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of Northbrook
          having authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of
          such insolvency or because such conservator, liquidator or statutory
          successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Payments
          by Allstate as above set forth shall be made directly to Northbrook or
          its conservator, liquidator or statutory successor.

     2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of Northbrook, the liquidator,
          receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent Northbrook shall give
          written notice to Allstate of the pendency of an obligation of the
          insolvent Northbrook on any policy reinsured, whereupon Allstate may
          investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the
          proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or
          defenses which it may deem available to Northbrook or its liquidator
          or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by Allstate shall be
          chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent
          Northbrook as part of the expenses of liquidation to the extent of a
          proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Northbrook
          solely as a result of the defense undertaken by Allstate

     2.)  Article X, ARBITRATION, shall be amended to include the following
     language at the end of that article:

          The decision of the Arbitrators shall be handed down within
          45 days of the date on which the arbitration is concluded.

     3.)  The second paragraph of Article XI, PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT, shall be
     deleted in its entirety and shall be replaced with the following language:

          This Agreement shall be effective as of December 31, 1987,
          and will be unlimited as to its duration; provided, however,
          it may be terminated with respect to the reinsurance of new
          business by either party giving the other party ninety (90)
          days prior written notice of termination to the other party.

     4.)  In addition, a new Article XII is added to the Agreement, as follows:

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                     OFFSET

     All monies due Northbrook or Allstate under this Agreement shall be offset
     against each other dollar for dollar.

<Page>

     5.)  Further, a new Article XIII is added to the agreement, as follows:

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                ENTIRE AGREEMENT

     This Agreement constitutes the entire contract between ALLSTATE
     and NORTHBROOK. No variation, modification or changes to this
     Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by an
     officer of each party.

     6.)  Finally, the definition of "RC" in Article V, paragraph 2, is deleted,
and replaced with the following language:

     RC = The Reserve change from the end of the prior accounting
     period to the end of the current accounting period for the
     reinsured contracts corresponding to the sum of the amounts
     on page 4, lines 10, 11, 12 and 13 of NORTHBROOK's Statutory
     Separate Account Statement. An accounting period shall be
     defined as one day.

This Amendment shall be effective on June 8, 1995. Except as amended hereby, the
Agreement shall remain unchanged.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties to the Agreement have caused this Amendment to be
duly executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the dates shown

                           EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 1987

                                     BETWEEN

                         (HEREINAFTER CALLED "ALLSTATE")


WHEREAS, NORTHBROOK and ALLSTATE entered into a Reinsurance Agreement effective
December 31, 1987 (hereinafter "Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the parties now believe that the Agreement does not accurately reflect
their existing practices relating to settlements for certain tax benefits and
liabilities; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Agreement to reflect the existing
practices with respect to such tax settlements;

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED, that the Agreement is amended as provided
below.

     1.) Article IV, paragraph 2, is amended by replacing subparagraph (d) with
        a new subparagraph (d), as follows:

           (d)  Insurance taxes, licenses and fees (excluding Federal Income Tax
           that is not related to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement),
           incurred by NORTHBROOK with respect to the contracts reinsured under
           this Agreement.

     2.) Article IV is further amended by adding a new paragraph 5, as follows:

                                   Page 1 of 2
<Page>

          5.   No less frequently than quarterly, ALLSTATE will calculate the
          amount of federal and state income tax liabilities incurred by
          NORTHBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement, and the amount of federal and state income tax
          benefits earned by NORTHBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts
          reinsured under this Agreement. If tax liabilities exceed tax
          benefits, the difference, plus a gross-up for additional federal and
          state income taxes, will be paid by ALLSTATE to NORTHBROOK. If tax
          benefits exceed tax liabilities, the difference, plus a gross-up for
          additional federal and state income taxes, will be paid by NORTHBROOK
          to ALLSTATE.

Except as amended hereby, the Agreement shall remain unchanged.
