<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">                            Section 1.13 Interest Rates; Eurocurrency Rate Notification.  The interest rate on  Eurocurrency Loans is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate, which may be derived  from  the  London  interbank  offered  rate.   The  London  interbank  offered  rate  is  intended  to  represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other  in the London interbank market.  In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced  that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make  rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE  Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank  offered rate.  As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered  rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon  which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans.  In light of this eventuality, public  and  private  sector  industry  initiatives  are  currently  underway  to  identify  new  or  alternative  reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event that the  London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth  in Sections 2.14(b) through (d) of this Agreement, such Sections 2.14(b) through (d) provide a  mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent will notify  the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.14, in advance of any change to the reference rate upon  which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based.  However, the Administrative Agent  does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to,  the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate  or  other  rates  in  the  definition of &#8220;Eurocurrency Rate&#8221;  or  with  respect  to  any  alternative  or  successor  rate thereto,  or replacement rate thereof, including  without limitation,  whether the  composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate,  as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.14(b) through (d), will be similar to, or  produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the Eurocurrency Rate or have the same  volume  or  liquidity  as  did  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  prior  to  its  discontinuance  or  unavailability.                                   ARTICLE II                                   The Credits               Section 2.01 Commitments.  Subject to the terms and express conditions set forth  herein, each Lender severally agrees to make a single term loan to the Borrower on the Closing  Date in Dollars in a principal amount equal to its Commitment.  Amounts repaid or prepaid in  respect of Loans may not be reborrowed.  The Commitments will terminate in full upon the  making of the Loans.                Section 2.02 Loans and Borrowings.                  (a)   Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of   the same Type made to the Borrower by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective   Commitments.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not   relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder, provided that the Commitments of the   Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender&#8217;s failure to make   Loans as required.                                         62                </FONT></DIV>

Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall   specify the following information:               (i)      the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;               (ii)     the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;               (iii)    whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency        Borrowing;               (iv)     in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to        be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term        &#8220;Interest Period;&#8221; and               (v)      the location and number of the Borrower&#8217;s account to which funds are        to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06.   If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an  ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency  Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month&#8217;s  duration.  Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the  Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such  Lender&#8217;s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

The Administrative Agent will make such  Loans available to the Borrower by wire transfer of the amounts so received, in immediately  available funds, to an account of the Borrower, in each case designated by the Borrower in the  applicable Borrowing Request.               (b)   Unless  the Administrative  Agent shall  have  received  notice  from  a  Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available  to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent  may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with  paragraph (a) of  this  Section  and  may,  in  reliance  upon  such  assumption  and  in  its  sole  discretion, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender  has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent,  then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent,  within three Business Days of written notice, such corresponding amount with interest thereon,  for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but  excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender,  the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in  accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, or (ii) in the case of the  Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the  Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such  Borrowing.               (c)   Each  of  the Administrative  Agent and  each  Lender  at  its  option  may  make any Loan or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder through any office or offices of  such Person described as such in such Person&#8217;s Administrative Questionnaire, or such other  office  or  offices  as  such  Person  may from  time  to  time  notify  the Borrower and  the  Administrative Agent; which office may include any Affiliate of such Person or any domestic  or foreign branch of such Person or such Affiliate (each, a &#8220;Designated Lender&#8221;); provided that  any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay any Loan in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Any Designated Lender shall be considered a  Lender; provided that in the case of an Affiliate or branch of a Lender, all provisions applicable  to a Lender shall apply to such Affiliate or branch of such Lender to the same extent as such  Lender; provided that in no event may a Disqualified Lender become a Designated Lender.                                        64                </FONT></DIV>

The Borrower may elect different options with    respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be    allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the    Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included  in the prepaid Borrowing.

None of the Borrower nor any other  Loan Party is required to be registered as an &#8220;investment company&#8221; as defined in, or subject to  regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.               Section 3.09 Taxes.  Each of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (a) has  timely filed or caused to be filed all material Tax returns and reports required to have been filed  and (b) has  paid  or  caused  to  be  paid  all  material  Taxes  required  to  have  been  paid  by  it,  except any Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which  adequate  reserves  have  been  provided  in  accordance  with  GAAP  or  applicable  foreign  accounting principles.               Section 3.10 ERISA.  (a) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected  to  occur  that,  when  taken  together  with  all  other  such  ERISA  Events  for  which  liability  is  reasonably  expected to  occur, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse  Effect, (b) with respect to each employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each  of  the Borrower and  its  ERISA  Affiliates  is  in  compliance  in  all  material  respects  with  the  applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published interpretations  thereunder, (c) there exists no Unfunded Pension Liability with respect to any Plans that would  reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (d) each Foreign Pension Plan  is in compliance in all material respects with all Requirements of Law applicable thereto and the  respective requirements of the governing documents for such plan.  With respect to each Foreign  Pension Plan, neither the Borrower, any Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,  employees or agents has engaged in a transaction which would subject the Borrower or any  Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a tax or civil penalty which could reasonably be expected,  individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  With respect to each  Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished to the  Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with applicable law and prudent  business practice or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the  jurisdiction  in  which  such  Foreign  Pension  Plan  is  maintained.  The  aggregate  unfunded  liabilities with respect to such Foreign Pension Plans would not reasonably be expected to result  in a Material Adverse Effect; the present value of the aggregate accumulated benefit liabilities  of all such Foreign Pension Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund each such Foreign  Pension Plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed by more  than $50,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of all such Foreign Pension Plans.               Section 3.11 Disclosure.
