based on such employee&#146;s Base Pay at the time of such authorization, that will enable such employee

completed and executed written notice setting forth the requested reduction in his or her payroll
deduction. The change in payroll deduction will become effective on a prospective basis as soon as
practicable after the Company receives the change notice. An Eligible Employee may change his or

of each pay period, the Company will credit the amount deducted from the participant&#146;s Base Pay to
the participant&#146;s Plan Account. The Company will pay no interest on any Plan Account balance in
any circumstance. As of the last day of each Subscription Period, the Company will divide the
amount then in the participant&#146;s Plan Account by the Subscription Price for such Subscription
Period as determined pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 , and credit the participant&#146;s Plan Account with the
number of whole shares that results. The Company will not credit fractional shares under this
Plan. The Company will issue and deliver share certificates to each participant within a
reasonable time thereafter. The Company will carry forward any amount remaining in a participant&#146;s
Plan Account to the next Subscription Period. However, any amount the Company carries forward
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8 will not reduce the amount a participant may contribute pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7 of this Plan during the next Subscription Period. If a participant does not accumulate
sufficient funds in his or her Plan Account to purchase at least ten shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
during a Subscription Period, the Company will deem such participant to have withdrawn from this
Plan pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 of this Plan.

number of shares available for purchase under this Plan, the Company will allocate the remaining
shares available for purchase among all participants in proportion to their Plan Account balances,
exclusive of any amounts carried forward pursuant to the preceding paragraph. If the number of
shares that would be credited to any participant&#146;s Plan Account in either or both of the
Subscription Periods occurring during any calendar year exceeds the limit specified in Section 2(c)
of this Plan, the Company will credit the participant&#146;s Plan Account with the maximum number of
shares permissible, and refund the remaining amounts to the participant in cash without interest
thereon.

participant&#146;s death at the election of the participant&#146;s beneficiary, any cash balance in such

A common stock at a Subscription Price determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;6 of this Plan using
