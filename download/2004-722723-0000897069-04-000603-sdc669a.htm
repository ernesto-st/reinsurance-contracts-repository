participation, shall be payable to the participant from and after such           date and

actually made, the purchasing Revolving Credit Lender shall be           required to pay
the Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of the           participation so
purchased for each day from and including the day upon which           the Mandatory
Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date           of payment

(y) in the case of Mandatory Borrowings, no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the
date specified in Section 1.01(c)), each Revolving Credit Lender will make available its
pro rata portion (determined in accordance with Section 1.07) of each such Borrowing
requested to be made on such date (or, in the case of Swingline Loans, the Swingline
Lender will make available the full amount thereof). All such amounts will be made
available in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, and,
except for Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent will make available to the Borrower at the Payment Office, in immediately available
funds, the aggregate of the amounts so made available by the Revolving Credit Lenders to
the extent of funds actually received by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Revolving Credit Lender prior to the
date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender&#146;s portion of any Borrowing to be made on such date,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to
the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made
available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such
Revolving Credit Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the
Administrative Agent&#146;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to
the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover on
demand from such Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on
such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount
was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal
to (i) if recovered from such Lender, at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first
three days and at the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Loans for each day
thereafter, and (ii)&nbsp;if recovered from the Borrower, the rate of interest applicable
to the respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant to Section 1.08. Nothing in this
Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Loans
hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
result of any failure by such Lender to make Loans hereunder.  </FONT></P>

          In the event that any Issuing Lender makes any payment under any Letter of
          Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in
          full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(a), such Issuing Lender
          shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify
each           Participant of such failure, and, except as provided in the proviso of the
          immediately succeeding sentence, each Participant shall promptly and
          unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant&#146;s
          Revolving Credit Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same
          day funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 12:00 Noon
          (New&nbsp;York time) on any Business Day, any Participant required to fund a
          payment under a Letter of Credit, such Participant shall make available to the
          respective Issuing Lender in Dollars such Participant&#146;s Revolving Credit
          Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day
funds;           provided, however, that no Participant shall be obligated to pay to the
          respective Issuing Lender its Revolving Credit Percentage of such unreimbursed
          amount for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of
          Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
          misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as
determined           by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision). If           and to the extent such Participant shall not have so made its
Revolving Credit           Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the
respective Issuing           Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to such Issuing
Lender, forthwith on           demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for
each day from such date           until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing
Lender at the overnight           Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the
interest rate applicable           to Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter. The
failure of any Participant to           make available to the respective Issuing Lender
its Revolving Credit Percentage           of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall
not relieve any other           Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available
to such Issuing Lender           its Revolving Credit Percentage of any Letter of Credit
on the date required, as           specified above, but no Participant shall be
responsible for the failure of any           other Participant to make available to such
Issuing Lender such other           Participant&#146;s Revolving Credit Percentage of any
such payment.  </FONT></P>

<U>Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings</U>. (a) The Borrower agrees to reimburse
each Issuing Lender, by making payment to the Administrative Agent in Dollars and in
immediately available funds at the Payment Office, for any payment or disbursement made
by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it (each such amount so paid
until reimbursed, an &#147;<U>Unpaid Drawing</U>&#148;), not later than one Business Day
following receipt by the Borrower of notice of such payment or disbursement (provided
that no such notice shall be required to be given if a Default or an Event of Default
under Section 10.05 shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Unpaid
Drawing shall be due and payable immediately without presentment, demand, protest or
notice of any kind (all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower)), with interest on
the amount so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender, to the extent not reimbursed
prior to 12:00 Noon (New&nbsp;York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement,
from and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such Issuing
Lender was reimbursed by the Borrower therefor at a rate per annum which shall be the sum
of the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans plus
the Base Rate each as in effect from time to time; provided, however, to the extent such
amounts are not reimbursed prior to 12:00 Noon (New&nbsp;York time) on the third Business
Day following the receipt by the Borrower of notice of such payment or disbursement or
following the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05,
interest shall thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Issuing
Lender (and until reimbursed by the Borrower) at a rate per annum which shall be the sum
of the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans plus
the Base Rate each as in effect from time to time plus 2%, in each such case, with
interest to be payable on demand. Each Issuing Lender shall give the Borrower prompt
written notice of each Drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it, provided that the
failure to give any such notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the Borrower&#146;s
obligations hereunder.  </FONT></P>

introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, guideline

governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Issuing Lender or any Participant with any request or directive by the
NAIC or by any such authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall either (i)&nbsp;impose,
modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement
against letters of credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participated in by any
Participant, or (ii) impose on any Issuing Lender or any Participant any other conditions
relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement; and the result of any of the
foregoing is to increase the cost to any Issuing Lender or any Participant of issuing,
maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by any Issuing Lender or any Participant hereunder or reduce the
rate of return on its capital with respect to Letters of Credit (except for changes in
the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or profits of such
Issuing Lender or such Participant pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized or in which its principal office or applicable lending office is located or
any subdivision thereof or therein), then, upon the delivery of the certificate referred

certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Lender or such Participant
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Issuing Lender or such
Participant for such increased cost or reduction in the amount receivable or reduction on
the rate of return on its capital. Each Issuing Lender or Participant, upon determining
that any additional amounts will be payable to it pursuant to this Section 2.06, will
give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall include a
certificate submitted to the Borrower by such Issuing Lender or such Participant (a copy
of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the
Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis therefor and the
calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Issuing
Lender or such Participant; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate any Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.06 for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or
such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the change in law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender&#146;s or such
Issuing Lender&#146;s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if
the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof. The certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this
Section 2.06 shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the
Borrower, although the failure to deliver any such certificate shall not release or
diminish the Borrower&#146;s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.05 upon subsequent receipt of such certificate.  </FONT></P>

imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal
office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any subdivision thereof
or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect to such

measured by the net income or net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the
jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which the principal office or

Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on
behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will furnish to the
Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of any Taxes is due

the Borrower, each           Lender agrees that from time to time after the Restatement
Effective Date, when           a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the
previous certification           obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such
Lender will deliver to the           Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new

required in order to confirm or           establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or           reduction in United States withholding tax with

Lender shall immediately           notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of
its inability to deliver any           such Form or Certificate, in which case such
Lender shall not be required to           deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant
to this Section 4.04(b).           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 4.04(a), but           subject to Section 13.04(b) and the immediately succeeding
sentence,           (x)&nbsp;the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required
to do so           by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the
United           States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein)           from interest, Fees or other amounts payable by it hereunder for the
account of           any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in           Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax
purposes to the           extent that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower U.S.
Internal Revenue           Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such
deduction or           withholding and (y)&nbsp;the Borrower shall not be obligated
pursuant to Section           4.04(a) to gross-up payments to be made by it to a Lender
in respect of income           or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such
Lender has not           provided to the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms
required to be           provided to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) or
(II) in the case of           a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in
clause (ii) above, to           the extent that such Forms do not establish a complete

contrary contained in           the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 4.04
and except as set forth           in Section 13.04(b), the Borrower agrees to pay any

          the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of the Borrower on a stand-alone
          basis and of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will exceed
          their respective debts; (b) the Borrower on a stand-alone basis and the
Borrower           and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole has not incurred and does not
intend to           incur, and does not believe that it will incur, debts beyond its
ability to pay           such debts as such debts mature; and (c) the Borrower on a
stand-alone basis and           the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will
have sufficient capital           with which to conduct their respective businesses. For
purposes of this Section           7.05(b), &#147;debt&#148; means any liability on a
claim, and &#147;claim&#148;          means (i) right to payment, whether or not such a
right is reduced to judgment,           liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed,           undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or
unsecured or (ii) right to an           equitable remedy for breach of performance if
such breach gives rise to a           payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to           judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured           or unsecured. The amount of contingent liabilities at any
time shall be computed           as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at           such time, represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an           actual or matured liability of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries.  </FONT></P>

investigation with respect to the administration, operation or the investment of assets
of any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending, expected or threatened;
using actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with Part 1 of subtitle E
of Title IV of ERISA, the aggregate liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
its ERISA Affiliates to all Plans which are multiemployer plans (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom, as of the close of
the most recent fiscal year of each such Plan ended prior to the date of the most recent
Credit Event, would not exceed $500,000; each group health plan (as defined in Section
607(1) of ERISA or Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code) which covers or has covered employees
or former employees of the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate has at all times been operated in compliance with the provisions of Part 6 of
subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code except for any failure to
comply that would not result in a material liability; no lien imposed under the Code or
ERISA on the assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate exists or is likely to arise on account of any Plan; and the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries may cease contributions to or terminate any employee benefit plan maintained
by any of them without incurring any material liability. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary of the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or contributed to

determined that such transaction complies with the foregoing provisions. If the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of the Borrower enters into an Affiliate Transaction (or a series of

transactions to the Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary, as the case may be, from a
financial point of view, from an Independent Financial Advisor and file the same with the
Administrative Agent.  </FONT></P>

in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not
taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and, except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder of any
Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its
possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. None of the
Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective officers,
directors, agents, or employees shall be responsible to any Lender or the holder of any
Note for, or be required or have any duty to ascertain, inquire or verify the accuracy
of, (i) any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in
any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith, (ii) the
execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection,
collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document,

forth in Section 5 or 6, or (vi) the existence or possible existence of any Default or
Event of Default.  </FONT></P>

such Lender (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of such Lender
wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against and on
account of the Obligations and liabilities of the Credit Parties to such Lender under

Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans as required by the provisions of this Agreement, or
purchasing participations as required by Section 1.14(d), may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all rights (including without limitation the right of setoff)

binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, no Credit Party may assign or
transfer any of its rights, obligations or interest hereunder without the prior written
consent of each of the Lenders and, provided further, that, although any Lender may

all or any portion of its Commitments hereunder except as provided in Sections 1.13 and
13.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or participant, as the case may be, shall not
constitute a &#147;Lender&#148; hereunder and, provided further, that no Lender shall
transfer or grant any participation under which the participant shall have rights to
approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except
to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity or
expiration date of any Commitment, Loan, Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of
Credit is not extended beyond the Revolving Loan Maturity Date) in which such participant
is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees
thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default increase
in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being understood that any

amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event
of Default or of a mandatory prepayment of the Loans or a mandatory reduction in the
Total Revolving Loan Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
participation, and that an increase in any Revolving Loan Commitment or Revolving Loan
and any Additional Extensions of Credit from time to time hereunder shall be permitted
without the consent of any participant if the participant&#146;s participation is not

<U>Register</U>. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the
Borrower&#146;s agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.15, and the Administrative
Agent hereby agrees, to maintain a register (the &#147;<U>Register</U>&#148;) on which it
will record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders and the Loans made
by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans
of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation,
shall not affect the Borrower&#146;s obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect
to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitment of such Lender, the Loans and the rights to
the principal of, and interest on, any Loan shall not be effective until such transfer is
recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership
of such Commitment and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the
transferor with respect to such Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the
transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments
and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the
acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment
and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 13.04(b) and payment to Administrative Agent
of the non-refundable assignment fee to the extent required to be paid pursuant to
13.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to
the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all
or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor
Lender shall surrender the Note(s) evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new
Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or
transferor Lender and/or the new Lender. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 13.15. Upon five (5)
Business Days&#146; prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent will allow any Lender to inspect and copy such Register (with respect to any entry
relating to such Lender&#146;s Loans) at the Administrative Agent&#146;s principal place
of business during normal business hours. Prior to the due presentment for registration
of transfer of any Note or other Obligation, the Administrative Agent may deem and treat
the Person in whose name a Note or other Obligation is registered as the absolute owner
of such Note or Obligation for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and
premium and interest on such Note or Obligation and for all other purposes whatsoever,
and the Administrative Agent shall not be affected by notice to the contrary.  </FONT></P>
