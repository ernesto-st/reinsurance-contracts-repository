<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">BACKGROUND INFORMATION



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pooled Companies have determined that their business operations should
be conducted by employees of State Auto P&#038;C on behalf of each of the Pooled
Companies and that State Auto Mutual should remain as the agent for each of the
Pooled Companies with respect to collecting and disbursing funds as required by
the Pooled Companies&#146; business operations. These arrangements have been effected
through the Management Agreement dated January&nbsp;1, 2000 (the &#147;2000 Management
Agreement&#148;), as amended from time to time, as to SA WI through the Amended and
Restated Management Agreement dated effective January&nbsp;1, 2000 (the &#147;2000 Midwest
Management Agreement&#148;), as to Farmers Casualty through the Amended and Restated
Management Agreement dated effective January&nbsp;1, 2000 (the &#147;2000 Farmers Casualty
Management Agreement&#148;), as to SA FL by the Cost Sharing Agreement dated
effective January&nbsp;1, 2003, and as to Meridian Security and Meridian Citizens
Mutual by the Management Services Agreement and Cost Sharing Agreement, each
dated effective as of July&nbsp;1, 2002 and by means of mutual reinsurance on a
percentage basis as herein provided.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Auto Mutual and State Auto P&#038;C originally entered into an
intercompany Reinsurance Agreement effective as of 12:01&nbsp;a.m.,
January&nbsp;1, 1987 (the &#147;Reinsurance Agreement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reinsurance Agreement has since been amended by an Addendum effective
January&nbsp;1, 1987, adding insolvency and arbitration provisions; by Amendment
Number 1 effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1992 amending the pooling percentages from
20% State Auto P&#038;C &#151; 80% State Auto Mutual to 30% and 70% respectively; by
Amendment Number 2 effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1991 excluding post retirement
health care benefits liability as a pooled expense and as of January&nbsp;1, 1994
excluding post employment benefits liability as a pooled expense; and by
Amendment Number 3 effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1995 adding Milbank as a party and
adjusting

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">the pooling percentages as follows: State Auto P&#038;C 35%, State Auto Mutual 55%
and Milbank 10% and by an Amended and Restated Reinsurance Pooling Agreement
dated July&nbsp;1, 1996 (the &#147;7/1/96 Reinsurance Agreement&#148;), which excluded from the
Reinsurance Agreement catastrophic loss claims and loss adjustment expenses
incurred by State Auto Mutual, State Auto P&#038;C and Milbank in the amount of
$100,000,000 in excess of $120,000,000 of such losses and loss adjustment
expense and the premiums for such exposure; and by an Amended and Restated
Reinsurance Pooling Agreement effective January&nbsp;1, 1998 (the &#147;&#145;98 Pooling
Agreement&#148;) which added SA WI as a party and adjusted the Respective Percentages
(as defined below) to State Auto P&#038;C 37%, State Auto Mutual 52%, Milbank 10%,
and SA WI 1%; and by a Reinsurance Pooling Agreement Amended and Restated as of
January&nbsp;1, 1999 (hereafter referred to as the &#147;&#145;99 Pooling Agreement&#148;) which
added Farmers Casualty as a party and adjusted the Respective Percentages to
State Auto P&#038;C-37%, State Auto Mutual-49%, Milbank-10%, Farmers Casualty-3%, and
SA WI-1%. In adopting the Reinsurance Pooling Agreement, amended and restated as
of January&nbsp;1, 2000, (the &#147;2000 SA Pooling Agreement&#148;)the parties amended and
restated the &#096;99 Pooling Agreement as the 2000 Pooling Agreement, to provide for
the continuation of the pooling arrangement it effects, including the
above-described previous amendments and additional amendments including the
following: removing from the scope of the 2000 Pooling Agreement the premiums,
losses, underwriting and administrative expenses attributable to State Auto
Mutual&#146;s voluntary assumption of reinsurance from third parties which are
unaffiliated with State Auto Mutual, which voluntary assumed reinsurance
contracts/treaties initially commenced on or after January&nbsp;1, 1999 (this January
1, 1999 and after voluntary third party assumption reinsurance is hereafter
referred to as the &#147;State Auto Mutual Reinsurance Book&#148;); adding SA OH as a new
party; removing an exclusion for post retirement health care benefits
liabilities; and post employment benefits liabilities and adjusting the
Respective Percentages to SA OH 1%, Farmers Casualty 3%, SA WI 1%, Milbank 10%,
State Auto P&#038;C 39% and State Auto Mutual 46%. The 2000 Pooling Agreement was
itself subject to five different amendments: the First Amendment effective
November&nbsp;17, 2000, clarified that the State Auto P&#038;C Catastrophe Assumption
Agreement, as defined in the 2000 SA Pooling Agreement provided such amount of
catastrophe reinsurance as was available in the then current Property
Catastrophe Overlying Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contract originally effective
July&nbsp;1, 1999 and annually renewed thereafter; the Second Amendment to the 2000
SA Pooling Agreement clarified that the business that became the legal
obligation of State Auto Mutual as a result of its merger with Meridian Mutual
Insurance Company effective June&nbsp;1, 2001, was excluded from the 2000 SA Pooling
Agreement until July&nbsp;1, 2001; the Third Amendment to the 2000 SA Pooling
Agreement amended the Respective Percentages of the parties to result in the
following: SA OH 1%, Farmers Casualty 3%, SA WI 1%, Milbank 17%, State Auto P&#038;C
59% and State Auto Mutual 19% and it also excluded the premiums or losses
attributable to the Stop Loss Agreement as defined in the Third Amendment, each
effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2004; The Fourth Amendment, effective January&nbsp;1, 2003
added SA FL to the 2000 SA Pooling Agreement with 0.7% as a Respective
Percentage, while lowering State Auto Mutual&#146;s Respective Percentage to 18.3%;
The Fifth Amendment, effective July&nbsp;1, 2004, excluded State Auto Middle Market
Insurance, (as defined below) from the 2000 SA Pooling Agreement. In addition to
the foregoing amendments to the pooling arrangement as set forth in the
various
agreements, each of these agreements and this 2000 Pooling Agreement is subject
to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;16, 1991 between State Auto Mutual and
State Auto P&#038;C (the &#147;Reserve Guaranty Agreement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The parties desire to amend and restate the 2000 Pooling Agreement, as amended
as described, to add two new parties, Meridian Security and Meridian Citizens
Mutual and to adjust the Respective Percentages of State Auto Mutual and its
wholly-owned insurer affiliates.
