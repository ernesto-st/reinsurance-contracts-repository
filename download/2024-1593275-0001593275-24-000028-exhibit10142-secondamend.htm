The resulting value, after application of the relevant haircut, will be the Adjusted Market Value of the  Collateral Fund Interest.  All determinations in respect of haircuts shall be made by the Calculation Agent.  Subject to agreement by Issuing Lender, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, and subject to a limit of one (1)  time per calendar quarter, no haircut shall apply in respect of a cured condition if Borrower can demonstrate to  Issuing Lender that the condition on the reporting date leading to a haircut no longer exists at the time of delivery of  the report.  Volatility  If the Collateral Fund has a Volatility Percentage greater than or equal to 17%, the Adjusted Market Value (before  any such adjustment) shall be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) 17% divided by (ii) the Volatility Percentage, to give  a new Adjusted Market Value.  &#8220;Volatility Percentage&#8221; means the annualized standard deviation of the Collateral Fund calculated using the 12 most  recent monthly returns.   Liquidity  Applying a Liquidation Period of one (1) day, if the Collateral Fund has Liquidity less than or equal to 50%, the  Adjusted Market Value (before any such adjustment) shall be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) Liquidity divided by  (ii) 50%, to give a new Adjusted Market Value.  Subject to agreement by Issuing Lender, which is not to be  unreasonably withheld, no haircut shall apply if Borrower can demonstrate to Issuing Lender that a market holiday  causes the measurement of Liquidity to be in error and subsequent measurements of Liquidity unaffected by market  holidays would not lead to such an error.  Applying a Liquidation Period of three (3) days, if the Collateral Fund has Liquidity less than or equal to 80%, the  Adjusted Market Value (before any such adjustment) shall be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) Liquidity divided by  (ii) 80%, to give a new Adjusted Market Value.  Subject to agreement by Issuing Lender, which is not to be  unreasonably withheld, no haircut shall apply if Borrower can demonstrate to Issuing Lender that a market holiday  causes the measurement of Liquidity to be in error and subsequent measurements of Liquidity unaffected by market  holidays would not lead to such an error.   &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; means the percentage of assets of the Collateral Fund (determined on a look-through basis to the  Strategy Funds) that can be liquidated within a specified number of days (the &#8220;Liquidation Period&#8221;), which is  calculated as the estimated reduction in the Collateral Fund&#8217;s gross market value (for this purpose, calculated as the  sum of (x) the market value of all long positions and (y) the absolute value of the sum of the market value of all  short positions, in each case, held directly or indirectly by the Collateral Fund (the &#8220;Liquidity GMV&#8221;)) over that  number of days divided by the Liquidity GMV as of the reporting date.  The Liquidity GMV takes into account all  positions in the relevant portfolio with the exception of a small number of out of universe positions that may exist,  which positions generally consist of equities or related derivatives that arise from corporate actions, manual FX or  equity hedge positions, or miscellaneous positions such as bonds posted to counterparties as margin (the &#8220;Out of  Universe Positions&#8221;).  The estimated reduction in Liquidity GMV is calculated by assuming that, for each day in the  Liquidation Period, up to 15% of the average daily volume over the past 20 days of a particular position can be  traded.  There is no observable market volume for FX, FX Options, and other OTC derivatives; therefore internally  estimated daily volumes provided by the Borrower (acting in good faith) shall be used to compute the average daily  volume over the prior 20 days.  Cash equivalents held at Two Sigma Hamilton Fund, LLC shall be excluded from  the liquidation calculation.   </FONT></DIV>

In the event the FTV Margin-to-Equity Ratio is greater than 50%, the Adjusted Market Value (before any such  adjustment) of the FTV Strategy Allocation shall be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) 50% divided by (ii) the FTV  Margin-to-Equity Ratio, in determining the Adjusted Market Value.  &#8220;FTV Margin-to-Equity Ratio&#8221; means (i) that  portion of margin required to be posted by FTV allocated to the FTV Strategy Allocation divided by (ii) the FTV  Strategy Allocation.  In the event the STV Strategy Allocation has a NMV-to-Capital Ratio of more than 75%, the Adjusted Market Value  (before such adjustment) of the STV Strategy Allocation shall be multiplied by a factor equal to (i) 75% divided by  (ii) the NMV-to-Capital Ratio, to give a new Adjusted Market Value.  &#8220;NMV-to-Capital Ratio&#8221; means the NMV of the Collateral Fund&#8217;s allocation to STV divided by the capital allocated  to the STV Strategy Allocation.  &#8220;Net Market Value&#8221; or &#8220;NMV&#8221; means the dollar delta of the long positions minus the absolute dollar delta of the  short positions.

For the avoidance of doubt, Unencumbered Cash shall not include  cash or Cash Equivalents that are  subject to a Lien or creditor claim with respect to extensions of credit by such bank or custodian, its affiliate or other  Person (other than intraday advances by the Custodian or any successor or additional cash management custodian to  facilitate the settlement of cash equivalent securities) or with respect to costs, fees, indemnities or other liabilities  related to any other account or asset of such Person.  </FONT></DIV>
