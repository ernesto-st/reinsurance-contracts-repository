<PAGE>



Turbine Purchase Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest per

2.1.1(c)(i); and

                         (ii) With respect to the principal portion of such
Turbine Purchase Loan which is, and during such portion of such periods as such

              2.1.3  Interest Provisions Relating to Loans.

                     (a) Interest Payment Dates. Borrower shall pay accrued
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan (i) in the case of each
Base Rate Loan, on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, (ii) in the
case of each LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period related to such
LIBOR Loan and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, every three
months after the date of such LIBOR Loan and (iii) in all cases, upon prepayment
(to the extent thereof and including any optional prepayments or Mandatory
Prepayments), upon conversion from one Type of Loan to another Type, and on the
Loan Maturity Date.

                     (b) LIBOR Loan Interest Periods.

                         (i) Each Interest Period selected by Borrower for all
LIBOR Loans shall be one, two, three, six or, if made available by
Administrative Agent, 12 months or such other period as close to three months as
is practicable to enable Borrower to limit the number of LIBOR Loans as required
by this Section 2.1.3(b)(i) or to comply with clauses (C), (D) or (F) of the
next sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
sentence, (A) any Interest Period which would otherwise end on a day which is
not a Banking Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Banking Day unless
such next Banking Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such
Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding Banking Day; (B) any
Interest Period which begins on the last Banking Day of a calendar month (or on
a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month
at the end of such Interest Period) shall end on the last Banking Day of a
calendar month; (C) Borrower may not select Interest Periods which would leave a
greater principal amount of Loans subject to Interest Periods ending after a
date upon which Loans are or may be required to be repaid than principal amount
of Loans scheduled to be outstanding after such date; (D) any Interest Period
for a Loan which would otherwise end after the Loan Maturity Date shall end on
the Loan Maturity Date; (E) LIBOR Loans for each Interest Period shall be in the
amount of at least $100,000; and (F) Borrower may not at any time have
outstanding more than twelve different Interest Periods relating to LIBOR Loans.

                         (ii) Borrower may contact Administrative Agent at any
time prior to the end of an Interest Period, for a quotation of Interest Rates
in effect at such time for


                                        4

<PAGE>



given Interest Periods and Administrative Agent shall promptly provide such
quotation. Borrower may select an Interest Period telephonically within the time
periods specified in Section 2.1.6, which selection shall be irrevocable on and
after the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Borrower shall confirm such
telephonic notice to Administrative Agent by telecopy on the day such notice is
given (in substantially the form of Exhibit C-3, a "Confirmation of Interest
Period Selection"). Borrower shall promptly deliver to Administrative Agent the
original of the Confirmation of Interest Period Selection initially delivered by
telecopy. If Borrower fails to notify Administrative Agent of the next Interest
Period for any LIBOR Loans in accordance with this Section 2.1.3(b), such Loans
shall automatically convert to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the current
Interest Period therefor. Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable
(and, in any case, within two Banking Days after delivery of the Confirmation of
Interest Period Selection) notify Borrower of each determination of the Interest
Rate applicable to each Loan.

                     (c) Interest Account and Interest Computations. Borrower
authorizes Administrative Agent to record in an account or accounts maintained
by Administrative Agent on its books (i) the interest rates applicable to all
Loans and the effective dates of all changes thereto, (ii) the Interest Period
for each LIBOR Loan, (iii) the date and amount of each principal and interest
payment on each Loan and (iv) such other information as Administrative Agent may
determine is necessary for the computation of interest payable by Borrower
hereunder. Borrower agrees that all computations by Administrative Agent of
interest shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. All computations
of interest on Base Rate Loans shall be based upon a year of 365 or 366 days and
the actual days elapsed, and shall be adjusted in accordance with any changes in
the Base Rate to take effect on the beginning of the day of such change in the
Base Rate. All computations of interest on LIBOR Loans shall be based upon a
year of 360 days and the actual days elapsed.

              2.1.4 Promissory Notes. The obligation of Borrower to repay the
Loans made by each Bank and to pay interest thereon at the rates provided herein
shall be evidenced by promissory notes in the form of Exhibit B (individually, a
"Note"), each payable to the order of such Bank and in the principal amount of
such Bank's Loan Commitment. Borrower authorizes each Bank to record on the
schedule annexed to such Bank's Note, the date and amount of each Loan made by
such Bank, and each payment or prepayment of principal thereunder and agrees
that all such notations shall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters
noted. Borrower further authorizes each Bank to attach to and make a part of
such Bank's Note continuations of the schedule attached thereto as necessary. No
failure to make any such notations, nor any errors in making any such notations,
shall affect the validity of Borrower's obligations to repay the full unpaid
principal amount of the Loans or the duties of Borrower hereunder or thereunder.

              2.1.5  Loan Funding.

                     (a) Notice. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be delivered by
Borrower to Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 12.1. Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents of each Notice of
Borrowing.

                     (b) Pro Rata Loans. All Loans shall be made on a pro rata
basis by the Banks in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares of
such Loans, with each


                                        5

Borrowing to consist of a Loan by each Bank equal to such Bank's Proportionate
Share of such Borrowing.

                     (c) Bank Funding. Each Bank shall, before 12:00 noon on
the date of each Borrowing, make available to Administrative Agent at its office
specified in Section 12.1, in same day funds, such Bank's Proportionate Share of
such Borrowing. The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation
hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing. No Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by
such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing.

                     (d) Construction Account. No later than 2:00 p.m. on the
date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, if the applicable conditions
precedent listed in Article 3 have been satisfied and to the extent
Administrative Agent shall have received the appropriate funds from the Banks,
Administrative Agent will make available the Loans requested in such Notice of
Borrowing (or so much thereof as the Banks shall have approved pursuant to this
Agreement) in Dollars and in immediately available funds, at Administrative
Agent's New York Branch, and shall deposit such Loans into the Construction
Account.

              2.1.6 Conversion of Loans. Borrower may convert Loans from one
Type of Loans to another Type; provided, however, that (i) any conversion of
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be made on, and only on, the first day
after the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans and (ii) Loans
shall be converted only in amounts of $1,000,000 or more. Borrower shall request
such a conversion by a written notice to Administrative Agent in the form of
Exhibit C-4, appropriately completed (a "Notice of Conversion of Loan Type"),
which specifies:

                     (a) The Loans, or portion thereof, which are to be
converted;

                     (b) The Type into which such Loans, or portion thereof, are
to be converted;

                     (c) If such Loans are to be converted into LIBOR Loans, the
initial Interest Period selected by Borrower for such Loans in accordance with
Section 2.1.3(b); and

                     (d) The date of the requested conversion, which shall be a
Banking Day.

Borrower shall so deliver each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type so as to
provide at least the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Any Notice of Conversion
of Loan Type may be modified or revoked by Borrower through the Banking Day
prior to the Minimum Notice Period, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. Each
Notice of Conversion of Loan Type shall be delivered by first-class mail or
telecopy to Administrative Agent at the office or to the telecopy number and
during the hours specified in Section 12.1; provided, however, that Borrower
shall promptly deliver to Administrative Agent the original of any Notice of
Conversion of Loan Type initially delivered by telecopy. Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents of each Notice of Conversion of
Loan Type.

              2.1.7  Prepayments.

                     (a) Terms of All Prepayments. Upon the prepayment of any
Loan (whether such prepayment is an optional prepayment under Section 2.1.7(b)
or a Mandatory Prepayment), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the
account of the Bank which made such Loan, as applicable, (i) all accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid, (ii) all accrued
fees to the date of such prepayment of the amount being prepaid, and (iii) if
such prepayment is the prepayment of a LIBOR Loan on a day other than the last
day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan, all Liquidation Costs incurred by
such Bank as a result of such prepayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Borrower shall have the right, by giving five Banking Days' notice to
Administrative Agent, in lieu of prepaying a LIBOR Loan on a day other than the
last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan, to deposit or cause
Administrative Agent to deposit, into an account to be held by Depositary Agent
(which account shall be subjected to the Lien of the Collateral Documents in a
manner satisfactory to Administrative Agent) an amount equal to the LIBOR Loans
to be prepaid. Such funds shall be held in such account until the expiration of
the Interest Period applicable to the LIBOR Loan to be prepaid at which time the
amount deposited in such account shall be used to prepay such LIBOR Loan and any
interest accrued on such amount shall be deposited in the Revenue Account. The
deposit of amounts into such account shall not constitute a prepayment of Loans
and all Loans to be prepaid using the proceeds from such account shall continue
to accrue interest at the then applicable interest rate for such Loans until
actually prepaid. All amounts in such account shall only be invested in
Permitted Investments as directed by and at the expense and risk of Borrower.
Borrower may reborrow the principal amount of any Loan which is prepaid.

                     (b) Optional Prepayments. Subject to Section 2.1.7(a),
Borrower may, at its option and without penalty, upon five Banking Days' notice
to Administrative Agent, prepay any Loans in whole or in part in minimum amounts
of $5,000,000 or an incremental multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

                     (c) Mandatory Prepayments. Borrower shall prepay (or cause
to be prepaid) Loans to the extent required by Section 6.4, 7.2.1(9), 7.2.4,
7.5, 7.6, or 7.7 of this Agreement, or any other provision of this Agreement
which requires prepayment of Loans (such prepayment, "Mandatory Prepayment").

         2.2  Letter of Credit Facilities.

              2.2.1 Issuance of the Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, LC Bank shall, during the Loan
Availability Period, on each Banking Day specified in a Notice of LC Activity
described in Section 2.2.3, issue, extend or increase the Stated Amount (as
applicable), for the account of Borrower, of the Letter(s) of Credit to which
such Notice of LC Activity relates, and deliver each such Letter of Credit (or a
notice of extension or increase in the Stated Amount thereof) to the applicable
LC Beneficiary. Subject to Section 2.2.6(b), LC Bank shall not modify the
conditions for draws or terms of availability for any Letter of Credit issued
and outstanding hereunder without Borrower's consent.

              2.2.2 Availability. LC Bank shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Agreement, at the request and for the account of Borrower,
make Letter(s) of Credit available to Borrower and/or the Project Owners solely
to enable the Project Owners to provide security for


                                        7

<PAGE>



their obligations under Project Documents. No Letter of Credit shall be issued,
renewed, replaced or extended by LC Bank until such time (or a reasonable period
before such time) as required under the Project Document pursuant to which such
Letter of Credit is being issued. The expiration date of each Letter of Credit
shall be on or prior to the scheduled Loan Maturity Date.

              2.2.3 Notice of LC Activity. Borrower shall request the issuance,
extension or increase in the Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit by delivering
to Administrative Agent and LC Bank an irrevocable written notice in the form of
Exhibit C-5, appropriately completed (a "Notice of LC Activity"), which
specifies, among other things:

                     (a) The particulars of the Letter of Credit to be issued
or the specific Letter of Credit to be extended or the Stated Amount of which is
to be increased;

                     (b) The Project to which such Letter of Credit relates;

                     (c) The issue date and expiration date of the Letter of
Credit to be issued or extended (neither of which shall in any event be later
than the scheduled Loan Maturity Date);

                     (d) The Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit which,
together with the Aggregate LC Stated Amount and all outstanding Reimbursement
Obligations, shall not exceed the lesser of (i) Total Letter of Credit
Commitment and (ii) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of
the Total Loan Commitment at such time over (B) the aggregate principal amount
of all Loans then outstanding plus the Aggregate LC Stated Amount and all
outstanding Reimbursement Obligations; and

                     (e) The Available Construction Funds which, after taking
into effect the issuance of such Letter of Credit, will be equal to or exceed
the remaining Project Costs for Funded Projects.

Borrower shall give the Notice of LC Activity to Administrative Agent and LC
Bank at least five Banking Days before the requested date of issuance of any
Letter of Credit, and at least five Banking Days before the requested date of
extension, or increase in the Stated Amount, thereof. Any Notice of LC Activity,
once given by Borrower, may not be modified or revoked without the prior consent
of the LC Bank.

              2.2.4 Reimbursement. LC Bank shall notify Borrower of any Drawing
Payment under any Letter of Credit within one Banking Day after the date that
such Drawing Payment is made (the date such Drawing Payment is made, the
"Drawing Date"); provided, however, that LC Bank's failure to provide such
notification shall not relieve Borrower of its Reimbursement Obligation (it
being understood, however, that LC Bank shall not be excused from any liability
it may have to Borrower as a result of such failure to provide the required
notice). No later than 11:00 a.m. on the fifth Banking Day after the Drawing
Date, Borrower shall make or cause to be made to LC Bank a Reimbursement Payment
in an amount equal to the sum of (a) the full amount of such Drawing Payment and
(b) interest thereon for each day or portion thereof until such Reimbursement
Payment is made at a rate equal to (i) from the Drawing Date through the fifth
Banking Day following the Drawing Date, the LIBO Rate plus the Applicable Margin
then applicable to LIBOR Loans and (ii) thereafter, the Default Rate; provided,
however, that such


                                        8

<PAGE>



Reimbursement Payment shall be for the benefit of each Bank (in proportion to
its Proportionate Share of the Total Letter of Credit Commitment) to the extent
that, prior to the time such Reimbursement Payment is made, such Bank has,
pursuant to Section 2.2.7, paid LC Bank its respective Proportionate Share of
the Drawing Payment made by LC Bank. If a Reimbursement Payment is made in the
full amount of such Drawing Payment by 3:00 p.m. on the applicable Drawing Date,
no interest shall be payable on such Drawing Payment.

              2.2.5 Reimbursement Obligation Absolute. The Reimbursement
Obligation of Borrower for each Drawing Payment shall be absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under and without regard to any circumstances, including, (a) any
lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Operative Documents, (b) any
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any terms of any
of the Operative Documents, (c) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or
other right which Borrower may have at any time against any LC Beneficiary or
any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such LC
Beneficiary or transferee may be acting), LC Bank, Administrative Agent, any
Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated herein or in the other Operative Documents, or in any
unrelated transaction, (d) any breach of contract or dispute among or between
Borrower, LC Bank, Administrative Agent, any Bank, or any other Person, (e) any
demand, statement, certificate, draft or other document presented under any
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in
any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect,
(f) payment by LC Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of any
demand, statement, certificate, draft or other document which does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (g) any non-application or
misapplication by an LC Beneficiary of the proceeds of any Drawing Payment under
a Letter of Credit or any other act or omission of an LC Beneficiary in
connection with a Letter of Credit, (h) any extension of time for or delay,
renewal or compromise of or other indulgence or modification to the Drawing
Payment granted or agreed to by LC Bank, Administrative Agent or any Bank, with
or without notice to or approval by Borrower, (i) any failure to preserve or
protect any Collateral, any failure to perfect or preserve the perfection of any
Lien thereon, or the release of any of the Collateral securing the performance
or observance of the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Operative
Documents, or (j) any other circumstances or happenings whatsoever relating to
Borrower, such Reimbursement Obligation or any Project, whether or not similar
to any of the foregoing, including the failure of Borrower to occupy or use any
Project in the manner contemplated by the Operative Documents or otherwise, any
defect in title, design, operation, merchantability, fitness or condition of any
Project or in the suitability of any Project for Borrower's purposes or needs,
any failure of consideration, destruction of or damage to any Project, any
commercial frustration of purpose, the taking by condemnation of title to or the
use of all or any part of any Project, any Regulatory Change, any failure of an
LC Beneficiary or any other Person to perform or observe any agreement, whether
express or implied, or any duty, liability or obligation arising out of or in
connection with the Operative Documents to which each is a party; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 2.2.5 shall relieve LC Bank,
Administrative Agent or any Bank from liability for its gross negligence or
willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement.

              2.2.6  Reduction and Reinstatement of Stated Amount.

                     (a) The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall be
reduced by the amount of Drawing Payments made in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.2, once so
reduced, the Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit shall not be reinstated
except (i) upon the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, LC Bank and
the Required Banks or (ii) upon payment by Borrower of the Reimbursement
Obligation corresponding to such Drawing Payment and satisfaction of the
conditions for an increase in the Stated Amount of a Letter of Credit set forth
in Section 2.2.3 and Article 3.

                     (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default under Section 8.1.4 or at such time as, pursuant to the terms
hereof, Administrative Agent and the Banks have accelerated the Obligations,
Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the LC Bank or the Required
Banks) shall be entitled to cancel all outstanding Letters of Credit any time at
least 15 days after delivery to the LC Beneficiary of each Letter of Credit that
will be canceled a written notice of such intent to cancel, whereupon the LC
Beneficiary shall be entitled to draw upon the applicable Letter of Credit in
accordance with its terms.

              2.2.7 Bank Participation. Each Bank severally agrees to
participate with LC Bank in the extension of credit arising from the issuance of
the Letters of Credit in an amount equal to such Bank's Proportionate Share of
the Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit, and the issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall be deemed a confirmation to LC Bank of such participation in such
amount. After written notification by LC Bank to Administrative Agent at any
time after LC Bank has received notice of or request for any Drawing Payment,
Administrative Agent may request the Banks to pay to Administrative Agent on
behalf of LC Bank their respective Proportionate Shares of all or any portion of
such Drawing Payment made or to be made by LC Bank under any Letter of Credit by
contacting each Bank telephonically (promptly confirmed in writing), and
specifying the amount of such Drawing Payment (as set forth in LC Bank's written
notification of Administrative Agent of the same), such Bank's Proportionate
Share thereof, and the date on which such Drawing Payment is to be made or was
made (as set forth in LC Bank's written notification of Administrative Agent of
the same); provided, however, that Administrative Agent shall not request the
Banks to make any payment under this Section 2.2.7 in connection with any
portion of a Drawing Payment for which LC Bank has been reimbursed through a
Reimbursement Payment by Borrower (unless such Reimbursement Payment has been
thereafter recovered by Borrower). Upon receipt of any such request for payment
from Administrative Agent, each Bank shall pay to Administrative Agent such
Bank's Proportionate Share of the unreimbursed portion of such Drawing Payment,
together with interest thereon at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds
Rate, as in effect from time to time, from the date of such Drawing Payment to
the date on which such Bank makes payment, and Administrative Agent shall
promptly thereafter pay to LC Bank all amounts so received. Each Bank's
obligation to make each such payment to Administrative Agent shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence or continuance of any Inchoate Default or
Event of Default, or the failure of any other Bank to make any payment under
this Section 2.2.7, and each Bank further agrees that each such payment shall be
made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. If any
Reimbursement Payment is made to Administrative Agent or LC Bank, Administrative


                                       10

<PAGE>



Agent or LC Bank, as applicable, shall pay to each Bank which has paid its
Proportionate Share of the Drawing Payment such Bank's Proportionate Share of
the Reimbursement Payment and shall, in the case of Administrative Agent, pay to
LC Bank and, in the case of LC Bank, retain, the balance of such Reimbursement
Payment.

              2.2.8 Commercial Practices. Borrower assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any LC Beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with
respect to the use of such Letter of Credit. Borrower agrees that neither LC
Bank, Administrative Agent nor any Bank (nor any of their respective directors,
officers or employees) shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use which may
be made of any Letter of Credit or for any acts or omissions of any LC
Beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) any reference which may
be made to this Agreement or to any Letter of Credit in any agreements,
instruments or other documents; (c) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of
documents other than the Letters of Credit, or of any endorsement(s) thereon,
even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged or any statement therein prove to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; (d) payment by LC Bank against
presentation of documents which do not strictly comply with the terms of the
applicable Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any
reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit; or (e) any other
circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter
of Credit, except only that LC Bank shall be liable to Borrower for acts or
events described in clauses (a) through (e) above, to the extent, but only to
the extent, of any direct damages, as opposed to indirect, special or
consequential damages, suffered by Borrower which Borrower proves were caused by
(i) LC Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether a
drawing made under the applicable Letter of Credit complies with the terms and
conditions therefor stated in such Letter of Credit or (ii) LC Bank's willful
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after a drawing by the respective LC
Beneficiary strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Letter of Credit. Without limiting the foregoing, LC Bank may accept any
document that appears on its face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation. Borrower hereby waives any right to object to any payment
made under a Letter of Credit with regard to a drawing that is in the form
provided in such Letter of Credit but which varies with respect to punctuation
(except punctuation with respect to any Dollar amount specified therein),
capitalization, spelling or similar matters of form.

              2.2.9 Term of Letters of Credit. Unless terminated earlier in
accordance with its terms, or extended pursuant to Section 2.2.3, each Letter of
Credit shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (a) 12:01 a.m., on the
Expiration Date stated therein (which shall be no later than the earlier of the
Loan Maturity Date and 15 days following the scheduled expiration of the letter
of credit obligations under the Project Document in connection with which such
Letter of Credit is to be issued) and (b) cancellation of such Letter of Credit
pursuant to Section 2.2.6(b).

         2.3  Total Commitments.

              2.3.1 Loan Commitment. The aggregate principal amount of all Loans
outstanding at any time or times shall not exceed $1,000,000,000 or, if such
amount is reduced by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3.4, such lower amount (such
amount, so reduced from time to time, the "Total Loan Commitment"), minus the
sum of (i) the aggregate Stated Amount of all


                                       11

<PAGE>



Letters of Credit then outstanding plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all
Reimbursement Obligations then outstanding.

              2.3.2 Turbine Purchase Loan Commitment. The aggregate principal
amount of all Turbine Purchase Loans outstanding at any time or times shall not
exceed $200,000,000 or, if such amount is reduced by Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.3.4, such lower amount (such amount, as so reduced from time to time,
the "Total Turbine Purchase Loan Commitment").

              2.3.3 Letter of Credit Commitment. The aggregate Stated Amount of
all Letters of Credit from time to time outstanding and all outstanding
Reimbursement Obligations thereunder shall not exceed $50,000,000, or, if such
amount is reduced by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3.4, such lower amount (such
amount, as so reduced from time to time, the "Total Letter of Credit
Commitment").

              2.3.4 Reductions and Cancellations. Borrower may, from time to
time upon five Banking Days written notice to Administrative Agent, permanently
reduce, by an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof or cancel in its entirety the Total Loan Commitment, the Total
Turbine Purchase Loan Commitment and/or the Total Letter of Credit Commitment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may not reduce or cancel the Total Loan
Commitment, the Total Turbine Purchase Loan Commitment and/or the Total Letter
of Credit Commitment if, after giving effect to such reduction or cancellation,
(a) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Loans then outstanding and
the Aggregate LC Stated Amount together with all outstanding Reimbursement
Obligations would exceed the Total Loan Commitment, (b) the Available
Construction Funds would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Technical
Committee and the Independent Engineer, be equal to or exceed remaining Project
Costs for all Funded Projects, or (c) such reduction or cancellation would cause
a violation of any other provision of this Agreement, the other Credit
Documents, any Project Documents, any Turbine Purchase Contracts or have a
Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, any Project Owner, any Funded Project.
Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent any Commitment Fees then due upon any
cancellation and, from the effective date of any reduction, the Commitment Fees
shall be computed on the basis of the Available Loan Commitment, as so reduced.
Once reduced or canceled, none of the Total Loan Commitment may be increased or
reinstated. Any reductions in the Total Loan Commitment, the Total Turbine
Purchase Loan Commitment or the Total Letter of Credit Commitment pursuant to
this Section 2.3.4 shall be applied ratably to each Bank's respective
Commitments in accordance with Section 2.7.1.

              2.3.5 Turbine Purchase Loan Conversion to Construction Loans. In
the event a Project satisfies the conditions precedent to initial funding
pursuant to Section 3.3 and prior to such initial funding the Turbines assigned
to such Project (as set forth in Exhibit G-3), if any, were Funded Turbines, the
Turbine Purchase Loans associated with such Funded Turbines shall be
automatically converted for all purposes hereof into Construction Loans and
shall cease to be considered outstanding Turbine Purchase Loans, including for
purposes of Section 2.3.2, in each case as of the Funding Date with respect to
such Project.


                                       12

         2.4  Fees.

              2.4.1 Fee Letter. Borrower shall pay to the Lead Arrangers,
Co-Arrangers and Administrative Agent solely for the Lead Arrangers',
Co-Arrangers' and Administrative Agent's respective accounts the fees described
in that certain letter from Borrower to the Lead Arrangers, Arrangers and
Administrative Agent dated the Closing Date.

              2.4.2 Loan Commitment Fees. On the last Banking Day in each
calendar quarter (where all or any portion of such calendar quarter occurs on or
after the Closing Date and prior to the Loan Maturity Date) and on the Loan
Maturity Date (or, if the Total Loan Commitment is canceled prior to such date,
on the date of such cancellation), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Banks, accruing from the Closing Date or the first day of
such quarter, as the case may be, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") for
such quarter (or portion thereof) then ending equal to the product of (a) 0.50%
times (b) the daily average Available Loan Commitment for such quarter (or
portion thereof) times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in such quarter (or portion thereof) and the denominator of which is the
number of days in that calendar year (365 or 366, as the case may be).

              2.4.3 Activation Fees. Concurrently with the first Borrowing in
respect of each Subsequent Project, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Banks, an activation fee (the "Activation Fee") equal to
the product of (a) 0.25% times (b) the total amount of Project Costs in respect
of such Subsequent Project less any Contributions by Calpine previously applied
to pay Project Costs for such Subsequent Project as reflected in such Subsequent
Project's Project Budget.

         2.5 Letter of Credit Fees.

              2.5.1 On the last Banking Day in each calendar quarter (or portion
thereof) commencing on or after the Closing Date and ending on the Loan Maturity
Date and on the Expiration Date of each Letter of Credit, Borrower shall pay to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks, accruing from the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit, a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit
Fee") for such quarter (or portion thereof) then ending at the rates per annum
described below and computed in the following manner: The Letter of Credit Fee
in respect of each Letter of Credit shall be equal to the product of (a) the
Applicable Margin with respect to LIBOR Loans applicable at such time, times (b)
the daily average Stated Amount of each such Letter of Credit for such quarter
(or portion thereof) times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in such quarter (or portion thereof) and the denominator of which is
360.

              2.5.2 Borrower shall pay to LC Bank solely for LC Bank's account
the issuing and paying fee and LC Bank's usual and customary charges (or such
charges as LC Bank and Borrower may agree) for the opening of any Letter of
Credit, for the negotiation of any drafts paid pursuant to any Letter of Credit
and for any wire transfers, all as described in that certain letter from
Borrower to LC Bank dated the Closing Date.

Loan Servicing Account, Reference: Calpine Construction Finance Company, in
lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds not later
than 12:00 noon on the date on which such payment is due. Any payment made after
such time on any day shall be deemed received on the Banking Day after such
payment is received. Administrative Agent shall disburse to each Bank each such

otherwise reasonably possible, otherwise on the next Banking Day.

              2.6.2 Date. Whenever any payment due hereunder shall fall due on a
day other than a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Banking Day (except in the case of any payment relating to a LIBOR Loan where
such next succeeding Banking Day is in the next calendar month, in which case
such payment shall be made on the next preceding Banking Day), and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of interest or fees, as
the case may be.

              2.6.3 Late Payments. If any amounts required to be paid by
Borrower under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents (including principal
or interest payable on any Loan, and any fees or other amounts otherwise payable
to Administrative Agent or any Bank) remain unpaid after such amounts are due,
Borrower shall pay interest on the aggregate, unpaid balance of such amounts
from the date due until those amounts are paid in full at a per annum rate equal
to the Default Rate.

              2.6.4 Net of Taxes, Etc.

                     (a) Taxes. Subject to each Bank's compliance with Section
2.6.7, any and all payments to or for the benefit of Administrative Agent or any
Bank by Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction, setoff or counterclaim of any kind
whatsoever and in such amounts as may be necessary in order that all such
payments, after deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto (excluding income and franchise taxes, which include taxes
imposed on or measured by the net income or capital of Administrative Agent or
such Bank by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein solely as a result of a connection between such Bank and such
jurisdiction or political subdivision, other than a connection resulting solely
from executing, delivering or performing its obligations or receiving a payment
under, or enforcing, this Agreement or any Note) (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"), shall be equal to the amounts otherwise
specified to be paid under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. If
Borrower shall be required by law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document to
Administrative Agent or any Bank, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may
be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.6.4, Administrative
Agent or such Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received


                                       14

<PAGE>



had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. If Borrower
shall make any payment under this Section 2.6.4 to or for the benefit of
Administrative Agent or any Bank with respect to Taxes and if Administrative
Agent or such Bank shall claim any credit or deduction for such Taxes against
any other taxes payable by Administrative Agent or such Bank to any taxing
jurisdiction then Administrative Agent or such Bank shall pay to Borrower an
amount equal to the amount by which such other taxes are actually reduced;
provided that the aggregate amount payable by Administrative Agent or such Bank
pursuant to this sentence shall not exceed the aggregate amount previously paid
by Borrower with respect to such Taxes. In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any
present or future stamp, recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies (not including income or franchise
taxes) that arise under the laws of the United States of America, the State of
New York or any other state or jurisdiction where a Project is located from any
payment made hereunder or under any other Credit Document or from the execution
or delivery or otherwise with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit
Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                     (b) Indemnity. Borrower shall indemnify each Bank for the
full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.6.4 paid by any
Bank, or any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted; provided that Borrower shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Bank for any penalties, interest or expenses relating to Taxes or
Other Taxes arising from the indemnitee's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Bank agrees to give written notice to Borrower of the assertion
of any claim against such Bank relating to such Taxes or Other Taxes as promptly
as is practicable after being notified of such assertion, and in no event later
than 180 days after the principal officer of such Bank responsible for
administering this Agreement obtains knowledge thereof; provided that any Bank's
failure to notify Borrower of such assertion within such 180 days period shall
not relieve Borrower of its obligation under this Section 2.6.4 with respect to
Taxes or Other Taxes arising prior to the end of such period, but shall relieve
Borrower of its obligations under this Section 2.6.4 with respect to Taxes or
Other Taxes between the end of such period and such time as Borrower receives
notice from such Bank as provided herein. Payments by Borrower pursuant to this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank makes
written demand therefor (submitted through Administrative Agent), which demand
shall be accompanied by a certificate describing in reasonable detail the basis
thereof. Each Bank agrees to repay to Borrower any refund (including that
portion of any interest that was included as part of such refund with respect to
Taxes or Other Taxes paid by Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.6.4) received
by such Bank for Taxes or Other Taxes that were paid by Borrower pursuant to
this Section 2.6.4 and to contest, with the approval and participation of and at
the expense of Borrower, any such Taxes or Other Taxes which such Bank or
Borrower reasonably believes not to have been properly assessed.

                     (c) Notice. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of
Taxes by Borrower, Borrower shall furnish to Administrative Agent, at its
address referred to in Section 12.1, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof. Borrower shall compensate each Bank for all
reasonable losses and expenses sustained by such Bank as a result of any failure
by Borrower to so furnish such copy of such receipt.


                                       15

<PAGE>



                     (d) Survival of Obligations. The obligations of Borrower
under this Section 2.6.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
repayment of the Obligations.

              2.6.5 Application of Payments. Payments made under this Agreement
or the other Credit Documents and other amounts received by Administrative Agent
and the Banks under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall first be
applied to any fees, costs, charges or expenses payable to Administrative Agent
or the other Banks hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, next to any
accrued but unpaid interest then due and owing, and then to outstanding
principal then due and owing or otherwise to be prepaid; provided, with respect
to payments applied to accrued but unpaid interest then due and owing or
outstanding principal then due and owing or otherwise to be prepaid, such
payments shall be applied to such debt associated with or attributable to
Projects in the order of the respective dates of Operation of such Projects or,
if all Loans associated with or attributable to Projects which have achieved
Operation have been paid, then, at Borrower's election, pro rata as to all such
debt, to such debt associated with or attributable to Turbines or to such debt
associated with or attributable to Projects (in the case of payments of such
debt associated with or attributable to Projects, such payment shall be applied
in order of the respective anticipated dates of Commercial Operation of such
Projects, as set forth in such Projects' Project Schedules).

              2.6.6 Failure to Pay Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from Borrower at least two Banking Days prior
to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that Borrower
will not make such payment in full, Administrative Agent may assume that
Borrower has made such payment in full to Administrative Agent on such date and
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due
such Bank. If and to the extent Borrower shall not have so made such payment in
full to Administrative Agent, such Bank shall repay to Administrative Agent
forthwith upon demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to Administrative Agent, at the
Federal Funds Rate for the first five days after such date, and subsequent
thereto at the Base Rate. A certificate of Administrative Agent submitted to any
Bank with respect to any amounts owing by such Bank under this Section 2.6.6
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

              2.6.7 Withholding Exemption Certificates. Administrative Agent on
the Closing Date and each Bank upon becoming a Bank hereunder including any
entity to which any Bank grants a participation, or otherwise transfers its
interest in this Agreement, agree that they will deliver to Borrower and
Administrative Agent (and Administrative Agent agrees that it will deliver to
Borrower) either (a) a statement that it is formed under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof or (b) if it is not so formed, a letter in
the form of Exhibit J-1 or Exhibit J-2, as appropriate, or other documentation
reasonably acceptable to Borrower and Administrative Agent and two duly
completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or
successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such
Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Bank which delivers
to Borrower and Administrative Agent a Form 1001 or 4224 pursuant to the
preceding sentence further


                                       16

<PAGE>



undertakes to deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent further copies of the
said letter and Form 1001 or 4224, or successor applicable forms, or other
manner of certification or procedure, as the case may be, on or before the date
that any such letter or form expires or becomes obsolete or within a reasonable
time after gaining knowledge of the occurrence of any event requiring a change
in the most recent letter and forms previously delivered by it to Borrower, and
such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by Borrower,
certifying in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224 that such Bank is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes, unless in any such cases an event (including
any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which
any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent a Bank from duly completing and delivering
any such letter or form with respect to it and such Bank advises Borrower that
it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of
United States federal income tax, and in the case of Form W-8 or W-9,
establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Borrower
shall not be obligated, however, to pay any additional amounts in respect of
United States Federal income tax pursuant to Section 2.6.4 (or make an
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 2.6.4) to any Bank (including any
entity to which any Bank sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise
transfers its rights under this Agreement) if the obligation to pay such
additional amounts (or such indemnification) would not have arisen but for a
failure of such Bank to comply with its obligations under this Section 2.6.7.

         2.7  Pro Rata Treatment.

              2.7.1 Borrowings, Commitment Reductions, Etc. Except as otherwise
provided herein, (a) each Borrowing and each reduction of the Total Loan
Commitment, the Total Turbine Purchase Loan Commitment or the Total Letter of
Credit Commitment shall be made or allocated among the Banks pro rata according
to their respective Proportionate Shares of such Loans or Commitments, as the
case may be, (b) each payment of principal of and interest on Loans shall be
made or shared among the Banks holding such Loans pro rata according to the
respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans held by such Banks and (c)
each payment of Commitment Fees, Activation Fees and Letter of Credit Fees shall
be shared among the Banks pro rata according to (i) their respective
Proportionate Shares of the Commitments to which such fees apply and (ii) in the
case of each Bank which becomes a Bank hereunder after the date hereof, the date
upon which such Bank so became a Bank.

              2.7.2 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
setoff, or otherwise) on account of Loans owed to it, in excess of its ratable
share of payments on account of such Loans obtained by all Banks entitled to
such payments, such Bank shall forthwith purchase from the other Banks such
participation in the Loans, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause
such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from such Bank
shall be rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such other Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount
of such other Bank's required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Bank in respect of the total


                                       17

<PAGE>



amount so recovered. Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation
from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.7.2 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the
direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

         2.8  Change of Circumstances.

              2.8.1 Inability to Determine Rates. If, on or before the first day
of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Loans, (a) Administrative Agent determines
that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period cannot be adequately and reasonably
determined due to the unavailability of funds in or other circumstances
affecting the London interbank market, or (b) Banks holding aggregate
Proportionate Shares of 33-1/3% or more of the Total Loan Commitment shall
advise Administrative Agent that (i) the rates of interest for such LIBOR Loans
do not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of making or
maintaining such Loans or (ii) deposits in Dollars in the London interbank
market are not available to such Banks (as conclusively certified by each such
Bank in good faith in writing to Administrative Agent and to Borrower) in the
ordinary course of business in sufficient amounts to make and/or maintain their
LIBOR Loans, Administrative Agent shall immediately give notice of such
condition to Borrower. After the giving of any such notice and until
Administrative Agent shall otherwise notify Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such condition no longer exist, Borrower's right to request the
making of or conversion to, and the Banks' obligations to make or convert to
LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. Any LIBOR Loans outstanding at the commencement
of any such suspension shall be converted at the end of the then current
Interest Period for such Loans into Base Rate Loans unless such suspension has
then ended.

              2.8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any Governmental Rule, any change in any Governmental Rule or the
application or requirements thereof (whether such change occurs in accordance
with the terms of such Governmental Rule as enacted, as a result of amendment,
or otherwise), any change in the interpretation or administration of any
Governmental Rule by any Governmental Authority, or compliance by any Bank or
Borrower with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any Governmental Authority (a "Change of Law") shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Bank to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan, such Bank shall
immediately notify Administrative Agent and Borrower of such Change of Law. Upon
receipt of such notice, (a) Borrower's right to request the making of or
conversion to, and the Bank's obligations to make or convert to, LIBOR Loans
shall be suspended for so long as such condition shall exist, and (b) Borrower
shall, at the request of such Bank, either (i) pursuant to Section 2.1.6,
convert any then outstanding LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans at the end of the
current Interest Periods for such Loans, or (ii) immediately repay pursuant to
Section 2.1.7 or convert LIBOR Loans of the affected Type into Base Rate Loans
if such Bank shall notify Borrower that such Bank may not lawfully continue to
fund and maintain such Loans. Any conversion or prepayment of LIBOR Loans made
pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to the last day of an Interest Period
for such Loans shall be deemed a prepayment thereof for purposes of Section 2.9.

              2.8.3 Increased Costs. If, after the date of this Agreement, any
Change of Law:


                                       18

<PAGE>



                     (a) Shall subject any Bank to any tax, duty or other charge
with respect to any LIBOR Loan or Commitment, or shall change the basis of
taxation of payments by Borrower to any Bank on such a Loan or with respect to
any Commitment (except for Taxes, Other Taxes or changes in the rate of taxation
on the overall net income of any Bank); or

                     (b) Shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement (without duplication of any reserve
requirement included within the applicable Interest Rate through the definition
of "Reserve Requirement") against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities
in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or any other acquisition of
funds by any Bank for any LIBOR Loan; or

                     (c) Shall impose on any Bank any other condition directly
related to any LIBOR Loan or Commitment;

and the effect of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank of
making, issuing, creating, renewing, participating in (subject to the
limitations in Section 10.13) or maintaining any such LIBOR Loan or Commitment
or to reduce any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder; then Borrower shall
from time to time, upon demand by such Bank, pay to such Bank additional amounts
sufficient to reimburse such Bank for such increased costs or to compensate such
Bank for such reduced amounts. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail
the amount of such increased costs or reduced amounts and the basis for
determination of such amount, submitted by such Bank to Borrower, shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower for purposes of
this Agreement.

              2.8.4 Capital Requirements. If any Bank determines that (a) any
Change of Law after the date of this Agreement increases the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Bank (or the Lending Office of
such Bank) or any Person controlling such Bank (a "Capital Adequacy
Requirement") and (b) the amount of capital maintained by such Bank or such
Person which is attributable to or based upon the Loans, the Commitments or this
Agreement must be increased as a result of such Capital Adequacy Requirement
(taking into account such Bank's or such Person's policies with respect to
capital adequacy), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent on behalf of such
Bank or such Person, upon demand of Administrative Agent on behalf of such Bank
or such Person, such amounts as such Bank or such Person shall reasonably
determine are necessary to compensate such Bank or such Person for the increased
costs to such Bank or such Person of such increased capital. A certificate of
such Bank or such Person, setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of
any such increased costs, delivered to Borrower by Administrative Agent on
behalf of such Bank or such Person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding on Borrower for purposes of this Agreement.

              2.8.5 Notice; Participating Banks' Rights. Each Bank will notify
Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will
entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.8, as promptly as
practicable, and in no event later than 90 days after the principal officer of
such Bank responsible for administering this Agreement obtains knowledge
thereof; provided that any Bank's failure to notify Borrower within such 90 day
period shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation under this Section 2.8.5
with respect to claims arising prior to the end of such period, but shall
relieve Borrower of its obligations under this


                                       19

<PAGE>



Section 2.8.5 with respect to the time between the end of such period and such
time as Borrower receives notice from the indemnitee as provided herein. No
Person purchasing from a Bank a participation in any Commitment (as opposed to
an assignment) shall be entitled to any payment from or on behalf of Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.8.3 or Section 2.8.4 which would be in excess of the
applicable proportionate amount (based on the portion of the Commitment in which
such Person is participating) which would then be payable to such Bank if such
Bank had not sold a participation in that portion of the Commitment.

         2.9 Funding Losses. If Borrower shall (a) repay or prepay any LIBOR
Loans on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans
(whether an optional prepayment or a Mandatory Prepayment), (b) fail to borrow
any LIBOR Loans in accordance with a Notice of Borrowing delivered to
Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any
applicable conditions or otherwise), (c) fail to convert any Loans into LIBOR
Loans in accordance with a Notice of Conversion of Loan Type delivered to
Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any
applicable conditions or otherwise), (d) fail to continue a LIBOR Loan in
accordance with a Confirmation of Interest Period Selection delivered to
Administrative Agent or (e) fail to make any prepayment in accordance with any
notice of prepayment delivered to Administrative Agent; Borrower shall, upon
demand by any Bank, reimburse such Bank for all costs and losses incurred by
such Bank as a result of such repayment, prepayment or failure ("Liquidation
Costs"). Borrower understands that such costs and losses may include losses
incurred by a Bank as a result of funding and other contracts entered into by
such Bank to fund LIBOR Loans. Each Bank demanding payment under this Section
2.9 shall deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for and the amount of costs and losses for which demand is made. Such
a certificate so delivered to Borrower shall, in the absence of manifest error,
be conclusive and binding as to the amount of such loss for purposes of this
Agreement.

         2.10 Alternate Office; Minimization of Costs.

              2.10.1 To the extent reasonably possible, each Bank shall
designate an alternative Lending Office with respect to its LIBOR Loans and
otherwise take any reasonable actions to reduce any liability of Borrower to any
Bank under Section 2.6.4, 2.8.3 or 2.8.4, or to avoid the unavailability of any
Type of Loans under Section 2.8.2 so long as such Bank, in its sole discretion,
does not determine that such designation is disadvantageous to such Bank.

              2.10.2 If and with respect to each occasion that a Bank either
makes a demand for compensation pursuant to Section 2.6.4, 2.6.7, 2.8.3 or 2.8.4
or is unable to fund LIBOR Loans pursuant to Section 2.8.2 or such Bank
wrongfully fails to fund a Loan, Borrower may, upon at least five Banking Days'
prior irrevocable written notice to each of such Bank and Administrative Agent,
in whole permanently replace the Commitment of such Bank; provided that Borrower
shall replace such Commitment with the Commitment of a commercial bank
reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Arrangers. Such replacement Bank shall upon
the effective date of replacement purchase the Obligations owed to such replaced
Bank for the aggregate amount thereof and shall thereupon for all purposes
become a "Bank" hereunder. Such notice from Borrower shall specify an effective
date for the replacement of such Bank's Commitment, which date shall not be
later than the tenth day after the day such notice is given. On the effective
date of any replacement of such Bank's Commitment pursuant to this Section
2.10.2,


                                       20

<PAGE>



Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank (a) any
fees due to such Bank to the date of such replacement; (b) accrued interest on
the principal amount of outstanding Loans held by such Bank to the date of such
replacement, and (c) the amount or amounts requested by such Bank pursuant to
each of Sections 2.6.4, 2.6.7, 2.8.3 and 2.8.4, as applicable. Borrower will
remain liable to such replaced Bank for any Liquidation Costs that such Bank may
sustain or incur as a consequence of repayment of such Bank's Loans (unless such
Bank has defaulted on its obligation to fund a Loan hereunder). Upon the
effective date of repayment of any Bank's Loans and termination of such Bank's
Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.10.2, such Bank shall cease to be a Bank
hereunder. No such termination of any such Bank's Commitment and the purchase of
such Bank's Loans pursuant to this Section 2.10.2 shall affect (i) any liability
or obligation of Borrower or any other Bank to such terminated Bank which
accrued on or prior to the date of such termination or (ii) such terminated
Bank's rights hereunder in respect of any such liability or obligation.

              2.10.3 Any Bank may designate a Lending Office other than that set
forth on Exhibit H and may assign all of its interests under the Credit
Documents, and its Notes, to such Lending Office; provided that such designation
and assignment do not at the time of such designation and assignment increase
the reasonably foreseeable liability of Borrower under Sections 2.6.4, 2.8.3, or
2.8.4 or make an Interest Rate option unavailable pursuant to Section 2.8.2.

         2.11 Extension of Loan Maturity Date.

              2.11.1 Borrower may, not earlier than 900 days and not later than
365 days prior to the initial Date Certain, request Administrative Agent to
request that the Banks agree to an extension of the initial Date Certain for an
additional period not to exceed one year from the date of the initial Date
Certain upon the terms and conditions of this Section 2.11.

              2.11.2 Upon receipt of any such request from Borrower,
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of such request. Each Bank
shall notify Administrative Agent not later than 45 days after receiving notice
of the extension request from Administrative Agent if, in its sole discretion,
it agrees to extend its Commitment (or any portion thereof) for such additional
requested period. Each such notice from a Bank which agrees to extend such
Commitment (each, a "Renewing Bank") shall specify (i) all or that portion of
its Commitment which it is willing to extend and (ii) the amount of any
additional Commitment it would be willing to assume (with respect to any
Renewing Bank, an "Additional Commitment"). Any Bank which fails to deliver such
notice to Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have declined to renew its
Commitment for such additional requested period. Each Commitment (or portion
thereof) which is not renewed is hereinafter referred to as a "Declined
Commitment" and collectively, the "Declined Commitments." After receipt of such
notices, Administrative Agent shall allocate the Declined Commitments (if any)
among each Renewing Bank pro rata according to the respective amounts of their
Additional Commitments (provided that in no event shall any such Renewing Bank
be allocated an amount in excess of its Additional Commitment). On the first
Business Day after the 60th day following the notice issued by Administrative
Agent to the Banks of the extension request, Administrative Agent shall advise
Borrower in writing (a "Renewal Notice"), with a copy to each of the Banks, of
the affirmative responses which it has


                                       21

<PAGE>



received from the Renewing Banks and the respective amounts of the Commitments
of each Renewing Bank.

              2.11.3 Subject to the following sentence, if the aggregate amount
of the Additional Commitments is less than 100% of the aggregate of the Declined
Commitments then in effect, the initial Date Certain shall only be extended if,
(i) on or before the initial Date Certain Borrower repays in accordance with
Section 2.1.7 (and subject to Section 2.3.4) the Loans outstanding comprising
Declined Commitments not being assumed pursuant to Section 2.11.4, if any, and
(ii) the Available Construction Funds, after giving effect to such repayment,
equal or exceed the remaining Project Costs of all Funded Projects.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate amount of the Additional
Commitments is less than 100% of the aggregate of the Declined Commitments,
Borrower may replace any Bank to the extent of such Bank's Declined Commitment,
with another commercial bank or banks reasonably satisfactory to the Lead
Arrangers and the LC Bank (a "Replacement Bank"). Borrower shall notify
Administrative Agent (who shall promptly forward such notice to the Banks), no
later than 180 days prior to the initial Loan Maturity Date, whether it will
prepay the Loans comprising the Declined Commitments in accordance with Section
2.1.7 and/or replace Banks to the extent of such Banks' Declined Commitments as
described in the preceding sentences. Each Bank whose outstanding Loans have
been repaid in full and who has been paid all other amounts due to it hereunder
shall cease to be a Bank hereunder and shall cancel and return to Borrower any
Notes held by such Bank.

              2.11.4 If the aggregate amount of the Additional Commitments
(including the Commitments provided by any Replacement Banks) is equal to or
greater than 100% of the aggregate of the Declined Commitments then in effect,
the following shall occur:

                     (a) the initial Date Certain shall be extended as requested
by Borrower;

                     (b) Borrower shall repay any Loans (and all fees and other
Obligations due in respect of such Loans) it has elected to repay pursuant to
Section 2.11.3;

                     (c) the Banks (including the Replacement Banks, if any)
shall enter into such assignment and assumption agreements reasonably acceptable
to Administrative Agent as may be necessary to transfer any Banks' Declined
Commitments to Banks (and Replacement Banks) extending Additional Commitments,
such assignment and assumption agreements to become effective on the initial
Date Certain (before giving effect to any extension thereof);

                     (d) on the initial Date Certain (prior to giving effect to
any extension thereof) each Replacement Bank shall for all purposes become a
"Bank" hereunder;

                     (e) Borrower shall, if applicable, execute and deliver to

is subject to the prior satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

              3.4.1 Monthly Drawdown Frequency. Construction Loans shall be
made no more frequently than two times per month.

              3.4.2 Notice of Construction Borrowing. Borrower shall have

Project Costs for each Project (not including financing fees and interest
expenses allocated to such Project but not reflected in such Project's Project
Budget and other expenses not allocable to a particular Project) for which the
disbursement of funds is being


                                       37

<PAGE>



requested is not projected to exceed 110% of the anticipated aggregate amount of

(B) the aggregate amount of Project Costs for all Funded Projects then under
construction is not projected to exceed 105% of the anticipated aggregate amount
of Project Costs for all such Projects as set forth in the respective Project
Budgets; provided, however, that if the condition described in clause (A) above
is not satisfied with respect to a particular Project for which funds are being
requested but (x) the Independent Engineer confirms that the cost overruns with
respect to such Project are not reasonably likely to exceed a specific amount
and (y) the condition described in clause (B) is satisfied and will continue to
be satisfied after giving effect to any further anticipated overruns with
respect to the Project experiencing such overruns, then the Banks will not
unreasonably withhold their consent to waive the condition described in clause
(A) above.

              3.4.4 Amount. Construction Loans shall be in such amounts as shall
ensure that uncommitted funds remaining in the Construction Account (other than

establishing to the satisfaction of Administrative Agent the continuing first
priority of the relevant Deeds of Trust (subject only to relevant Permitted
Encumbrances and Permitted Liens described in clause (a), (b) or (c) of the
definition thereof) and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Administrative Agent.

relevant Major Contractor and Major Subcontractors thereof for all work,
services and materials, including equipment and fixtures of all kinds, done,
previously performed or furnished for the construction of the relevant Project,
and in respect of which Borrower has requested payment; provided, however, that
such releases may be conditioned upon receipt of payment with respect to work,
services and materials to be paid for with the proceeds of the requested
Construction Loan or other Borrowing pursuant to this Section 3.4.

              3.4.7 Applicable Permits. Except as disclosed in the Permit
Schedule applicable to the relevant Project, if any, all Applicable Permits and
Applicable Third Party Permits (as of the date of the Construction Credit Event)
with respect to the construction and, if applicable, operation of the relevant
Project required to have been obtained by the relevant Project Owner (or such
Project Owner and its Joint Venturers, if applicable) or any other applicable
Major Project Participant by the date of such Construction Credit Event from any
Governmental Authority shall have been issued and be in full force and effect
and not subject to current legal proceedings or to any unsatisfied conditions
that could reasonably be expect to allow material modification or revocation,

Project Budget without material difficulty or delay prior to the time the
relevant Project Owner (or such Project Owner and its Joint Venturers, if
applicable) or the applicable other Major Project Participant, as applicable,
requires such Permit, or (b) there shall exist alternate solutions (the expected
cost of which is reflected in the applicable Project Budget) reasonably
satisfactory to the Independent Engineer which would eliminate the need for such
Permit. Except as disclosed in the applicable Permit Schedule, if any, such
Permits which have been obtained by the relevant Project Owner (or such Project
Owner and its Joint Venturers, if applicable) or any applicable Major Project
Participant shall not be subject to any restriction, condition, limitation or
other provision that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to Borrower or such Project.

other things, the Lien on such Project and related Collateral granted on the
Closing Date or the relevant Funding Date, as the case may be, there shall be
redelivery of (a) such matters as are described in Sections 3.3.3 through 3.3.6

the relevant Project shall have been done in a good and workmanlike manner and
in accordance with the Construction Contracts and Prudent Utility Practices and
there shall not have been filed with or served upon any Portfolio Entity with
respect to such Project or any part thereof notice of any Lien, claim of Lien or
attachment upon or claim affecting the right to receive payment of any of the
monies payable to any of the Persons named on such request which has not been
released by payment or bonding or otherwise or which will not be released with

have received insurance proceeds or money or other assurances sufficient in the
reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer to
assure restoration and Completion of such Project prior to the Loan Maturity
Date and each of the conditions set forth in Section 7.5.3 has been satisfied.

              3.4.12 Absence of Litigation. No action, suit, proceeding or
investigation shall have been instituted against any Portfolio Entity or the
relevant Project which could reasonably


                                       39

<PAGE>



be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or the Project with
respect to which a Construction Loan is being requested, except as approved by
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Banks.

              3.4.13 Insurance. Insurance complying with the requirements of

              3.8.7 Debt to Capitalization Ratio. Borrower's Debt to
Capitalization Ratio shall be no more than the Maximum Debt to Capitalization
Ratio.

         3.9  Failure of Conditions Precedent to be Satisfied for a Particular
Project.

                     (a) In the event that Borrower requests a Borrowing with
respect to more than one Project, and the applicable conditions set forth in
this Article 3 for such Borrowing have not been satisfied for one or more of
such Projects, then such Borrowing shall be permitted to occur for the Projects
in respect of which all applicable conditions have been satisfied, unless (i)
the failure of any condition to be satisfied with respect to any Project has the
effect of causing an Event of Default or Inchoate Default to occur under this
Agreement, in which case the requested Borrowing shall not be permitted to occur
until such time as the Event of Default or Inchoate Default has been cured and
the applicable conditions have been satisfied, or (ii) a Non-Fundamental Project
Default or Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default has occurred and is
continuing with respect to any Project, as the case may be, in which case the
provisions of Section 3.9(b) shall apply.

                     (b) In the event that a Non-Fundamental Project Default or
Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default has occurred and is continuing with
respect to a given Project but the conditions to the requested Borrowing in
respect of a different Project are otherwise satisfied, then:

                         (i) In the event that (A) the Four-Quarter Portfolio
Interest Coverage Ratio yields a minimum projected ratio of no less than [*] to
1.00 through the same term of the Base Case Project Projections delivered in
respect of the Funded Projects and (B) the Debt to Capitalization Ratio yields
maximum projected ratios that are no higher than the Maximum Debt to
Capitalization Ratio at any time through the Loan Maturity Date, then Borrower
shall be permitted to obtain the requested Borrowing for a Project with respect
to which no Non-Fundamental Project Default or Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate
Default has occurred and is continuing and which otherwise satisfied the
required conditions of this Article 3.

                         (ii) In the event that (A) the Four-Quarter Portfolio
Interest Coverage Ratio yields a minimum projected ratio of less than [*] to
1.00 through the same term of the Base Case Project Projections delivered in
respect of the Funded Projects or (B) the Debt to Capitalization Ratio yields
maximum projected ratios that are higher than the Maximum Debt to Capitalization
Ratio at any time through the Loan Maturity Date, then Borrower shall not be
permitted to obtain the requested Borrowing with respect to any Project unless
and until such time as (x) the Four-Quarter Portfolio Interest Coverage Ratio
and the Debt to Capitalization Ratio meet the thresholds specified above or (y)
the Non-Fundamental Project Default or Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default,
is no longer continuing and, in each case, the applicable conditions in this
Article 3 have been satisfied.

         3.10 Funding of Equity.

                     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Borrower shall have the right to, at any time, make a
Contribution into the Construction Account


                                       51

<PAGE>



or any sub-account therein and have such funds applied to the payments of Costs
in accordance with Section 7.1.2 so long as (i) at least 10 Banking Days prior
to the requested disbursement of funds from the Construction Account, Borrower
shall have provided Administrative Agent with a certificate, dated the date of
the proposed disbursement and signed by Borrower, substantially in the form of
Exhibit C-6 or C-8, as the case may be, in respect of the Project or Turbine for
which the disbursement is being requested and (ii) at least 4 Banking Days prior
to the date of the requested disbursement of funds from the Construction
Account, the Independent Engineer shall have provided Administrative Agent with
a certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit C-7 or C-9, as the case may
be, relating to such disbursement; provided, however, that in the case of a
Project (rather than a Turbine) such certificates need not certify as to whether
the amount of Project Costs incurred by the Project for which the disbursement
is being requested are in excess of the amounts set forth in the corresponding
Project Budget, and the funds deposited by Borrower into the Construction
Account with respect to Projects shall be released regardless of whether or not
the requested disbursement is in excess of the amounts set forth in the
corresponding Project Budget; provided, further, that until the funding of the
initial Loans with respect to a given Project or Turbine, funds deposited by
Borrower into the Construction Account with respect to such Project or Turbine
shall be released notwithstanding failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
(i) Sections 3.3, 3.4.5, 3.4.7, 3.4.8, 3.4.9, 3.4.11, 3.4.12, 3.4.14, 3.4.15,
3.4.17, 3.4.18 (as it relates to such Project), 3.4.19 and 3.4.20 with respect
to such Project, or (ii) Sections 3.5, 3.6.5, 3.6.7, 3.6.8, 3.6.10, 3.6.11 (as
it relates to such Turbine), and 3.6.12 (with respect to such Turbine).

                     (b) In the event that Borrower makes a Contribution with
respect to a Project as contemplated in paragraph (a) above or otherwise with
respect to a Project which is in excess of the Base Equity and Additional
Borrower Equity which Borrower is required to contribute or cause to be
contributed under this Agreement, then Borrower shall, at any time (i) prior to
the Completion of the Project for which such funds were contributed, (ii) when
no Non-Fundamental Project Default, Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default,
Event of Default or Inchoate Default has occurred and is continuing, (iii) so
long as Borrower's Four-Quarter Portfolio Interest Coverage Ratio as of the end
of the most recent calendar quarter equaled or exceeded [*] to 1.00, and (iv) so
long as Borrower's Debt to Capitalization Ratio as of the end of the most recent
calendar quarter was no higher than the Maximum Debt to Capitalization Ratio,
obtain reimbursement of or repayment of, as the case may be, such Contributions
through Loans by satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 3.4 with respect
to such Project; provided, however, that the difference between (x) the
aggregate amount of Contributions by Borrower to the Funded Projects less (y)
the sum of the amount of the requested reimbursement or repayment, as the case
may be, plus the aggregate amount of all prior reimbursements and repayments
shall be no less than (z) $[*] plus the Contributions required pursuant to
Section 5.17.1.

         3.11 No Approval of Work. Neither the making of any Loan nor the
issuance of any Letter of Credit hereunder shall be deemed an approval or
acceptance by Administrative Agent or the Banks of any work, labor, supplies,
materials or equipment furnished or supplied with respect to any of the Projects
or Turbines.

         3.12 Waiver of Funding; Adjustment of Drawdown Requests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Required Banks, without waiving any of the
Banks' rights hereunder, shall have the right to effect a Construction Credit
Event, Turbine Purchase Credit Event or LC Action


                                       52

<PAGE>



hereunder without full compliance by Borrower with the conditions described in
this Article 3. In the event Administrative Agent determines that an item or
items listed in a Drawdown Certificate as a Cost is not properly included in
such Drawdown Certificate, Administrative Agent, in consultation with the
Independent Engineer, may in its reasonable discretion cause to be made a Loan
or Loans in the amount requested in such Drawdown Certificate less the amount of
such item or items or may reduce the amount of Loans made pursuant to any
subsequent Drawdown Certificate. In the event that Borrower prevails in any
dispute as to whether such Costs were properly included in such Drawdown
Certificate, Loans in the amount requested but not initially made shall
forthwith be made.

                                   ARTICLE 4.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

              Borrower makes the following representations and warranties to and
in favor of the Lead Arrangers, Administrative Agent, LC Bank and the other
Banks as of the Effective Date and as of the date of each Construction Credit
Event, Turbine Purchase Credit Event and LC Action, in each case to the extent
set forth in Article 3. All of these representations and warranties shall
survive the Effective Date, the issuance of any Letters of Credit and the making
of the Loans:

         4.1  Organization.

              4.1.1  Borrower is a limited partnership duly constituted, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is

general partnership, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Oregon and, in each case, is duly qualified, authorized
to do business and in good standing in the states where the character of its
properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary
including, in respect to a Project Owner and an Equipment Finance Company party

such Portfolio Entity has all requisite corporate, partnership or company, as
the case may be, power and authority to own or hold under lease and operate the

Entity is directly or indirectly a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Borrower.

         4.2  Authorization; No Conflict. Each Portfolio Entity has duly
authorized, executed and delivered, or has been properly assigned, each
Operative Document to which such Portfolio Entity is a party and neither such
Portfolio Entity's execution and delivery thereof nor its consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby nor its compliance with the terms thereof (a)
does or will contravene the constituent documents or any other Legal Requirement
applicable to or binding on such Portfolio Entity or any of its properties, (b)
does or will contravene or result in any breach of or constitute any default
under, or result in or require the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted

bound or affected or (c) does or will require the consent or approval of any
Person which has not already been obtained.

         4.3  Enforceability. Each of the Operative Documents to which each
Portfolio Entity is a party is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Portfolio Entity enforceable against such Portfolio Entity in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights or by the effect of general
equitable principles. None of the Operative Documents to which a Portfolio
Entity is a party has been amended or modified except in accordance with this
Agreement.

         4.4  Compliance with Law. There are no violations by any Portfolio

Requirement which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Borrower or any Funded Project. Except as otherwise have been delivered to
Administrative Agent, no notices of violation of any Legal Requirement relating
to any Funded Project or related Site or any Funded Turbine have been issued,
entered or received by any Portfolio Entity, any Partner or, to Borrower's
knowledge, Calpine.

         4.6  Adverse Change.

              4.6.1  With respect to each Funded Project, to the best of
Borrower's knowledge, there has occurred no material adverse change in the
Project Budget, Project Schedule or Base Case Project Projections, in the
economics or feasibility of constructing and/or operating such Project, or in
the financial condition, business or property of any Major Project Participant,
or any other event or circumstance which is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Borrower or such Project (a) as of the Closing Date, since May
28, 1999 and (b) after the Closing Date, except as disclosed to Administrative
Agent in writing at the time the representation in this Section 4.6 is being

Borrower's knowledge, there has occurred no material adverse change in the
economics or feasibility of procuring or owning such Turbine, or in the
financial condition, business or property of the Turbine Purchase Contractor

         4.7  Investment Company Act, Etc. Neither any Portfolio Entity nor any
Partner is an investment company or a company controlled by an investment
company, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and neither
any Portfolio Entity nor any Partner is or has been determined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other Governmental Authority to be subject to, or
not exempt from, regulation under PUHCA or the FPA (other than as provided by
PURPA or as an Exempt Wholesale Generator).

         4.8  ERISA. Either (a) there are no ERISA Plans for any Portfolio
Entity or any member of the Controlled Group or (b) each Portfolio Entity and
each member of the Controlled Group have fulfilled their obligations (if any)
under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code for each ERISA Plan,
each ERISA Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the currently
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and neither any Portfolio Entity nor
any Controlled Group member has incurred any liability to the PBGC or any ERISA
Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums due in the

                                       55

<PAGE>



any Portfolio Entity's assets constitute assets of an employee benefit plan
within the meaning of 29 CFR Section 2510.3-101.

         4.9  Permits. With respect to each Funded Project in the case of
Sections 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 and with respect to each Funded Turbine in the case of
Section 4.9.3:

              4.9.1  There are no Permits under existing law as such Project is
designed that are or will become Applicable Permits other than the Permits
described in the applicable Permit Schedule. Except as disclosed therein, each
Applicable Permit listed in Part I(A) of the applicable Permit Schedule is in
full force and effect and is not subject to any current legal proceeding or to
any unsatisfied condition that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Borrower or such Project, and all applicable appeal periods
with respect thereto have expired. Each Permit listed in Part II(A) of the
applicable Permit Schedule is either (a) timely obtainable at a cost consistent
with the applicable Project Budget prior to the time the applicable Project
Owner requires such Permit and is of a type that is routinely granted upon
application and that would not normally be obtained before contemplated by
Borrower or the relevant Project Owner or (b) able to be eliminated as an
Applicable Permit through the implementation of alternative solutions at a cost
consistent with the applicable Project Budget. No fact or circumstance exists,
to Borrower's knowledge, which indicates that any Permit identified in Part
II(A) of the applicable Permit Schedule shall not be timely obtainable at a cost
consistent with the applicable Project Budget without material difficulty or
delay by the relevant Project Owner before it becomes an Applicable Permit. Each
Project Owner is in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Permits.

              4.9.2  There are no Permits under existing law as such Project is
designed that are or will become Applicable Third Party Permits other than the
Third Party Permits described in the applicable Permit Schedule (other than
those, the failure of which to obtain could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or such Project). Except as disclosed
therein, each Applicable Third Party Permit listed in Part I(B) of the
applicable Permit Schedule is in full force and effect and is not subject to
current legal proceeding or to any unsatisfied condition that could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or such Project, and
all applicable appeal periods with respect thereto have expired. No fact or
circumstance exists, to Borrower's knowledge, which indicates that any Permit
identified in Part II(B) of the applicable Permit Schedule shall not be timely
obtainable at a cost consistent with the applicable Project Budget without
material difficulty or delay by the applicable Major Project Participant before
it becomes an Applicable Third Party Permit. To the best knowledge of Borrower,
each Major Project Participant is in compliance in all material respects with
its respective Applicable Third Party Permits, each other Major Project
Participant possesses all licenses, franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks
and trade names, or rights thereto necessary to perform its duties under the
Operative Documents to which it is a party, and such Person is not in violation
of any valid rights of others with respect to any of the foregoing which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or such
Project.

              4.9.3  To the best knowledge of Borrower, each Turbine Purchase
Contractor possesses all licenses, franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks
and trade names, or rights thereto necessary to perform its duties under the
Turbine Purchase Contract to which it is a party, and such Turbine Purchase
Contractor is not in violation of any valid rights of others with


                                       56

<PAGE>



respect to any of the foregoing which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Borrower.

         4.10 Qualifying Facility/Exempt Wholesale Generator. Each Funded
Project, upon Completion of such Project, will be a Qualifying Facility or an
Eligible Facility and, from and after the commencement of commercial operations
of each Project that is an Eligible Facility, the respective Project Owner will
be an Exempt Wholesale Generator.

         4.11 Hazardous Substance.

              4.11.1 Except as set forth in Exhibit G-8: (a) neither any
Portfolio Entity nor any Partner nor Calpine (the "Subject Companies"), with
respect to the Sites, Improvements or other Mortgaged Properties owned or leased
by a Portfolio Entity, is or has in the past been in violation of any Hazardous
Substance Law which violation could reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability to any of the Subject Companies or their respective
properties and assets or in an inability of any Portfolio Entity to perform its
obligations under the Operative Documents; (b) none of the Subject Companies
nor, to the best knowledge of the Partners and Borrower, any third party has
used, released, discharged, generated, manufactured, produced, stored, or
disposed of in, on, under, or about the Sites, Improvements or other Mortgaged
Properties owned or leased by any Portfolio Entity, or transported thereto or
therefrom, any Hazardous Substances that could reasonably be expected to subject
the Banks to liability or the Subject Companies to liability, under any
Hazardous Substance Law; (c) there are no underground tanks, whether operative
or temporarily or permanently closed, located on the Sites, Improvements or
other Mortgaged Properties owned or leased by any Portfolio Entity; (d) there
are no Hazardous Substances used, stored or present at, on or, to the best
knowledge of the Partners and Borrower, near the Sites, Improvements or other
Mortgaged Properties owned or leased by any Portfolio Entity, except in
compliance with Hazardous Substance Laws and other Legal Requirements or as
disclosed in the Environmental Reports; and (e) to the best knowledge of the
Partners and Borrower, there neither is nor has been any condition,
circumstance, action, activity or event that could reasonably be expected to be
a material violation by the Subject Companies of any Hazardous Substance Law, or
to result in liability to the Banks or material liability to the Subject
Companies under any Hazardous Substance Law.

              4.11.2 Except as set forth on Exhibit G-7 or Exhibit G-8, there is
no pending or, to the best knowledge of Borrower, threatened, action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) or any non-governmental third party with
respect to the presence or Release of Hazardous Substances in, on, from or to
the Sites, Improvements or other Mortgaged Properties owned or leased by any
Portfolio Entity.

              4.11.3 Neither any Partner nor Borrower nor Calpine has knowledge
of any past or existing violations of any Hazardous Substances Laws by any
Person relating in any way to the Sites, Improvements or other Mortgaged
Properties owned or leased by any Portfolio Entity.

         4.12 Litigation. Except as set forth on Exhibit G-7 there are no
pending or, to the best knowledge of Borrower, threatened actions or proceedings
of any kind, including actions or proceedings of or before any Governmental
Authority, to which any Portfolio Entity, any


                                       57

<PAGE>



Partner, Calpine, or, to the best knowledge of Borrower, any other Major Project
Participant, Turbine Purchase Contractor or Project is a party or is subject, or
by which any of them or any of their properties or a Project or Turbine are
bound, which if adversely determined to or against any Portfolio Entity, any
other Major Project Participant or a Project or Turbine could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any Funded Project or Borrower.

         4.13 Labor Disputes and Acts of God. Neither the business nor the
properties of any Portfolio Entity, any Partner, Calpine, or, to the best
knowledge of Borrower, any other Major Project Participant or Turbine Purchase
Contractor are affected by any fire, explosion, accident, strike, lockout or
other labor dispute, drought, storm, hail, earthquake, embargo, act of God or of
the public enemy, or other casualty (whether or not covered by insurance), which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any Funded
Project or Borrower.

         4.14 Project Documents and Turbine Purchase Contracts.

              4.14.1 Copies of all of the Project Documents and Turbine Purchase
Contracts in effect with respect to the Funded Projects and the Funded Turbines,
as the case may be, as of such date have been delivered to Administrative Agent
by Borrower. Except as has been previously disclosed in writing to
Administrative Agent, as of the date of delivery of such Project Documents or
Turbine Purchase Contracts none of such Project Documents or Turbine Purchase
Contracts has been amended, modified or terminated.

              4.14.2 To Borrower's knowledge, the representations and warranties
of the Major Project Participants contained in the Operative Documents relating
to the Funded Projects and the Funded Turbines, as the case may be, other than
this Agreement are true and correct.

         4.15 Disclosure. Neither this Agreement nor any certificate or other
documentation furnished to Administrative Agent, or to any consultant submitting
a report to Administrative Agent, by or, to the knowledge of Borrower, on behalf
of any Portfolio Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the other Project Documents or Turbine Purchase Contracts or the
design, description, testing or operation of a Project or a Turbine, contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading under the circumstances in which they were made at the time such
statements are made. As of the Closing Date, there is no fact known to Borrower
which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Borrower or any Funded Project which has not been set forth in this Agreement
or in the other documents, certificates and written statements furnished to
Administrative Agent and/or the Independent Engineer, by or on behalf of
Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
documentation furnished to Administrative Agent and to the Independent Engineer

information, is true and correct in all material respects and all such
documentation does not omit to state any fact which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Borrower or any Funded Project.

or thereby, be subject to, or not exempt from, regulation under the FPA or PUHCA
or under state laws and regulations respecting the rates or the financial or
organizational regulation of electric utilities, (ii) no Portfolio Entity is
subject to regulation under any Governmental Rule as to securities, rates or
financial or organizational matters that would preclude any Loans, or the
incurrence by any Portfolio Entity of any of the Obligations or the execution,
delivery and performance by any Portfolio Entity of the Operative Documents and
(iii) no Portfolio Entity will be deemed by any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction to be subject to financial, organizational or rate regulation as an
"electric utility," "electric corporation," "electrical company," "public
utility," "public utility holding company" or any similar entity under any
existing law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority.

         4.19 Regulation U, Etc. No Portfolio Entity is engaged principally, or
as one of its principal activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (as defined in Regulations T, U
or X of the Federal Reserve Board), and no part of the proceeds of the Loans or

such margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any such margin stock.

to all legal and factual matters material to the estimates set forth therein,
(b) as of the date delivered are consistent with the provisions of the Project
Documents and (c) indicate that the estimated Project Costs with respect to such

                                       59

<PAGE>



opinion of Borrower, as of the date delivered the textual material accompanying
the Base Case Project Projections for the Funded Projects discloses all
information reasonably necessary for an understanding of the Base Case Project
Projections, and does not contain any material misstatements or omit any
information which, in conjunction with other information given, would be
necessary to make such information not materially misleading.

to Sections 3.3.23, 3.5.15 and 5.5 are true, complete and correct and fairly
present the financial condition of each such Person as of the date thereof. Such
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Neither the
Portfolio Entities, the Partners, Calpine or such Affiliated Major Project
Participants has any material liabilities, direct or contingent, except as has
been disclosed in such financial statements.

         4.22 Existing Defaults. No Portfolio Entity is in default under any
material term of any Operative Document relating to the Funded Projects or the
Funded Turbines or any agreement relating to any obligation of any Portfolio
Entity for or with respect to borrowed money, and to the best of Borrower's
knowledge, no other party to any Project Document or Turbine Purchase Contract
is in default thereunder.

         4.23 No Default. No Event of Default, Inchoate Default, Non-Fundamental
Project Default or Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default has occurred or is
existing.

                     (a) With respect to each Funded Project (other than Funded
Subsequent Projects in which the relevant Project Owner holds a partial
undivided ownership interest), the Project Owner and the Equipment Finance
Company (with respect to any equipment subject to an Equipment Lease) with
respect to such Project have good, and with respect to real property,


                                       60

<PAGE>



marketable and insurable title to such Project, and all of the Collateral
relating to such Project, and good, marketable and insurable title to, or, as
applicable, a leasehold estate in, the Site and the Easements relating to such
Project in existence as of the date this representation is made (except that
title to certain of the Easements which are licenses may not be insurable), in
each case free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances or other exceptions to title
other than Permitted Liens. With respect to each Funded Turbine, such Turbine is
wholly-owned by a Turbine Owner and such Turbine Owner has good title to such
Turbine, free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances or other exceptions to title
other than Permitted Liens.

                     (b) With respect to each Funded Subsequent Project in which
the relevant Project Owner (subject to the last sentence of clause (a) above)
holds a partial undivided ownership interest, such Project Owner has good, and
with respect to real property, marketable and insurable title to the applicable
undivided portion of such Project, and all of the Collateral relating to such
Project, and good, and with respect to real property, marketable and insurable
title to, or, as applicable, a leasehold estate in, the applicable undivided
portion of the Site and the Easements relating to such Project in existence as
of the date this representation is made (except that title to certain of the
Easements which are licenses may not be insurable), in each case free and clear
of all Liens, encumbrances or other exceptions to title other than Permitted
Liens.

                     (c) Subject to clause (b) above, (i) each Project Owner
owns 100% of its respective Project, (ii) each Project Owner other than Borrower
holds title to only one Project, (iii) each Funded Turbine is 100% owned by a
Turbine Owner that is a directly or indirectly wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Borrower, and (iv) all equipment leased to a Funded Project pursuant to an
Equipment Lease is 100% owned by an Equipment Finance Company that is a directly
or indirectly wholly-owned Subsidiary of Borrower.

                     (d) The Lien of the Collateral Documents (to the extent
then existing) constitutes a valid lien on all Collateral relating to the Funded
Projects (including any equipment leased to a Project Owner pursuant to an
Equipment Lease) and relevant Turbine Owners' interest in the Funded Turbines.
The Lien of the Collateral Documents (to the extent then existing) constitutes a
valid and subsisting first priority Lien of record on all the Mortgaged
Properties relating to the Funded Projects described in the Deeds of Trust and,
a first priority perfected security interest in all the personal property
relating to the Funded Projects and the Funded Turbines described in the
Collateral Documents, subject to no Liens except Permitted Encumbrances and
Permitted Liens described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the definition thereof;
provided, however, as set forth in the Project/Turbine Owner Security
Agreements, the Lien on the Collateral comprising each Project or Turbine shall
not secure those Obligations relating to or arising from Projects owned by
Project Owners that own one or more Projects that have achieved Operation prior
to the relevant Funding Date or Turbine Funding Date, as the case may be.

         4.26 Trademarks. Each Portfolio Entity owns or has the right to use all
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and other
rights, which are necessary for the operation of its business. Nothing has come
to the attention of Borrower to the effect that (a) any material product,
process, method, substance, part or other material presently contemplated to be
sold by or employed by any Portfolio Entity in connection with its business will
infringe any patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, copyright, license or
other right


                                       61

<PAGE>



owned by any other Person, (b) there is pending or threatened any claim or
litigation against or affecting any Portfolio Entity contesting its right to
sell or use any such product, process, method, substance, part or other material
or (c) there is, or there is pending or proposed, any patent, invention, device,
application or principle or any statute, law, rule, regulation, standard or code
relating to the use of technology or intellectual property by any Portfolio
Entity which could reasonably have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or a
Project.

         4.27 Collateral. The security interests granted to Administrative Agent
pursuant to the Collateral Documents in the Collateral related to the Funded
Projects (including equipment leased to a Project Owner pursuant to an Equipment
Lease) and the Funded Turbines (a) constitute as to personal property included
in the Collateral and, with respect to subsequently acquired personal property
included in the Collateral, will constitute, a perfected security interest under
the UCC to the extent a security interest can be perfected by filing or, in the
case of the Accounts and the Pledged Equity Interests (the Pledged Equity
Interests being "certificated securities" as defined in Article 8 of the UCC),
by possession by or on behalf of the secured party and (b) are, and, with
respect to such subsequently acquired personal property, will be, as to
Collateral related to the Funded Projects (including equipment leased to a
Project Owner pursuant to an Equipment Lease) and the Funded Turbines perfected
under the UCC as aforesaid, superior and prior to the rights of all third
Persons now existing or hereafter arising whether by way of mortgage, lien,
security interests, encumbrance, assignment or otherwise; provided, however, as
set forth in the Collateral Documents, the Lien on the Collateral comprising
each Project (including equipment leased to a Project Owner pursuant to an
Equipment Lease) or Turbine shall not secure those Obligations relating to or
arising from Projects owned by Project Owners that own one or more Projects that
have achieved Operation prior to the relevant Funding Date or Turbine Funding
Date, as the case may be. Except to the extent possession of portions of such
Collateral is required for perfection, all such action as is necessary has been
taken to establish and perfect Administrative Agent's rights in and to such
Collateral to the extent Administrative Agent's security interest can be
perfected by filing, including any recording, filing, registration, giving of
notice or other similar action. No filing, recordation, re-filing or
re-recording other than those listed on Exhibit D-6 hereto is necessary to
perfect and maintain the perfection of the interest, title or Liens of the
Collateral Documents related to the Funded Projects (including equipment leased
to a Project Owner pursuant to an Equipment Lease) and the Funded Turbines, and
all such filings or recordings will have been made to the extent Administrative
Agent's security interest can be perfected by filing. Each Portfolio Entity has
properly delivered or caused to be delivered to Administrative Agent all such
Collateral that requires perfection of the Lien and security interest described
above by possession.

         4.28 Sufficiency of Project Documents.

constructed and operated on its respective Site and the Easements, respectively;
and

                     (c) provide adequate ingress and egress from the Site for
such Project for any reasonable purpose in connection with the construction and
operation of such Project.

              4.28.2 With respect to each Funded Project, there are no services,
materials or rights required for the construction or operation of such Project

Projections, respectively.

         4.29 Utilities. With respect to each Funded Project, all gas and
electrical interconnection and utility services necessary for the construction

or the necessary rights of way therefor have been acquired.

              4.30.2 All necessary easements, rights of way, licenses,
agreements and other rights for the construction, interconnection and
utilization of the interconnection facilities have been acquired.

         4.31 Proper Subdivision. With respect to each Funded Project, at such
time as a Project Owner obtains any title or leasehold interests therein, the
Site for such Project has been properly subdivided or entitled to exception
therefrom, and for all purposes such Site may be mortgaged, conveyed and
otherwise dealt with as separate legal lots or parcels.

         4.32 Flood Zone Disclosure. With respect to each Funded Project, none
of the Collateral in respect of such Project includes improved real property
that is or will be located below the relevant flood level elevation in an area
that has been identified by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has
been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended.

         4.33 Acquisition of Real Property. No Portfolio Entity has acquired or
leased any real property or other interest in real property (excluding the
acquisition (but not the exercise) of any


                                       63

<PAGE>

permitted pursuant to Section 6.23.

         4.34 Representation and Warranties Prior to Effective Date. Each
representation and warranty of the Partners and Calpine under the Credit
Documents and each representation and warranty of Borrower under the Operative
Documents, in each case as made by such Persons prior to the Effective Date

true and correct in all material respects as if made on such date, unless such
representation or warranty expressly relates solely to another time, in which
case it shall have been true and correct in all material respects when made.

                                   ARTICLE 5.

              5.5.1  Unless Administrative Agent otherwise consents, deliver or
cause to be delivered to Administrative Agent, in form and detail reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent:

                     (a) As soon as practicable and in any event within 45 days

balance sheet of the Portfolio Entities, the Partners, Calpine and each other
Affiliated Major Project Participant as of the last day of such quarterly period
and the related statements of income, cash flows, and partners' capital (where

Agent. Such certificate for the Portfolio Entities, the Partners, Calpine and
each Affiliated Major Project Participant shall not be qualified or limited

along with such financial statements, a certificate signed by a Responsible
Officer of such Person, certifying that such officer has made or caused to be
made a review of the transactions and financial condition of such Person during
the relevant fiscal period and that such review has not, to the best of such
Responsible Officer's knowledge, disclosed the existence of any event or
condition which constitutes an Event of Default or Inchoate Default (or, in the
case of the Portfolio Entities, a Non-Fundamental Project Default or
Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default), or if any such event or condition
existed or exists, the nature thereof and the corrective actions that such
Person has taken or proposes to take with respect thereto, and also certifying
that such Person is in compliance with all applicable material provisions of
each Credit Document to which such Person is a party or, if such is not the
case, stating the nature of such non-compliance and the corrective actions which
such Person has taken or proposes to take with respect thereto.

         5.6  Books, Records, Access. Maintain or cause to be maintained

Administrative Agent and Independent Engineer at any reasonable times and upon
reasonable prior notice to inspect all of its properties, including the Sites,
to examine or audit all of its books, accounts and records and make copies and
memoranda thereof and to witness all Performance Tests.

<PAGE>



Project or Turbine and, to the extent reasonably available, the Major Project
Participants or Turbine Purchase Contractors, as the case may be, and at such
times as Administrative Agent shall reasonably require, including such reports

<PAGE>



Borrower shall incorporate all such corrections, changes or adjustment as
Administrative Agent reasonably deems appropriate.

                     (b) (i)  As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than two Banking Days after delivery by Borrower of the financial statements of
the Portfolio Entities required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.5.1 and at
such other times as required under this Agreement, calculate and deliver to
Administrative Agent the Debt to Capitalization Ratio based on the financial
statements so delivered. Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower in writing
of any suggested corrections, changes or adjustments which should be made to
such ratio calculations within five days after receipt. Borrower shall
incorporate all such corrections, changes or adjustments as Administrative Agent

                         (ii)  Borrower shall maintain, as of the end of each
calendar quarter (after giving effect to any Construction Credit Event and/or
the Turbine Purchase Credit Event as of the end of each such calendar quarter),
a Debt to Capitalization Ratio of no more than the Maximum Debt to
Capitalization Ratio.

                     (c) For purposes of this Agreement, Borrower shall
calculate the Four-Quarter Portfolio Interest Coverage Ratio and the Debt to
Capitalization Ratio without taking into account the EBITDA produced by, or the
Contributions with respect to, a Project (i) where a Non-Fundamental Project
Default or Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default shall have occurred and be
continuing with respect to such Project or (ii) that is an Unfunded Project.

         5.11 Indemnification.

              5.11.1 Indemnify, defend and hold harmless Administrative Agent
and each Bank, and in their capacities as such, their respective officers,
directors, shareholders, controlling persons, employees, agents and servants
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against and reimburse the Indemnitees
for:

                     (a) any and all claims, obligations, liabilities, losses,
damages, injuries (to person, property, or natural resources), penalties, stamp
or other similar taxes, actions, suits, judgments, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees) of whatever kind or nature, whether or not well
founded, meritorious or unmeritorious, demanded, asserted or claimed against any
such Indemnitee (collectively, "Subject Claims") in any way relating to, or
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the other Operative
Documents, any Project or any Turbine, except for claims by a Portfolio Entity
against an Indemnitee;

                     (b) any and all Subject Claims arising in connection with
the release or presence of any Hazardous Substances at any Project, whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable, including all costs of removal and disposal of
such Hazardous Substances, all reasonable costs required to be incurred in (i)
determining whether any Project is in compliance and (ii) causing each Project
to be in compliance, with all applicable Legal Requirements, all reasonable
costs associated with claims for damages to persons or property, and reasonable
attorneys' and consultants' fees and court costs; and


                                       71

<PAGE>



                     (c) any and all Subject Claims in any way relating to, or
arising out of or in connection with any claims, suits, liabilities against any
Portfolio Entity, any Partner, Calpine or any of their Affiliates.

              5.11.2 The foregoing indemnities shall not apply with respect to
an Indemnitee, to the extent arising as a result of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, but shall continue to apply to other
Indemnitees.

              5.11.3 The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive
foreclosure of the Collateral Documents and satisfaction or discharge of the
Portfolio Entities obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents,
and shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies of the Banks.

              5.11.4 In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought
against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall notify Borrower of the
commencement thereof, and Borrower shall be entitled, at its expense, acting
through counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee, to participate in,
and, to the extent that Borrower desires, to assume and control the defense
thereof. Such Indemnitee shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in
any action, suit or proceeding the defense of which has been assumed by
Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be entitled to
assume and control the defenses of any such action, suit or proceedings if and
to the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of such Indemnitee and its
counsel, such action, suit or proceeding involves the potential imposition of
criminal liability upon such Indemnitee or a conflict of interest between such
Indemnitee and Borrower or between such Indemnitee and another Indemnitee
(unless such conflict of interest is waived in writing by the affected
Indemnitees), and in such event (other than with respect to disputes between
such Indemnitee and another Indemnitee) Borrower shall pay the reasonable
expenses of such Indemnitee in such defense.

              5.11.5 Borrower shall report to such Indemnitee on the status of
such action, suit or proceeding as material developments shall occur and from
time to time as requested by such Indemnitee (but not more frequently than every
60 days). Borrower shall deliver to such Indemnitee a copy of each document
filed or served on any party in such action, suit or proceeding, and each
material document which Borrower possesses relating to such action, suit or
proceeding.

              5.11.6 (a) Notwithstanding Borrower's rights hereunder to control
certain actions, suits or proceedings, if any Indemnitee reasonably determines
that failure to compromise or settle any Subject Claim made against such
Indemnitee is reasonably likely to have an imminent and material adverse effect
on such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall be entitled (and Borrower shall cause
other relevant Portfolio Entity to agree to the same) to compromise or settle
such Subject Claim.

                     (b) Notwithstanding Borrower's rights hereunder to control
certain actions, suits or proceedings, if the Required Banks reasonably
determine that failure to compromise or settle any Subject Claim made against
such Indemnitee is reasonably likely to have an imminent and material adverse
effect on Borrower or any Project, such Indemnitee or the Required Banks, as the
case may be, shall provide Borrower with written notice of a


                                       72

<PAGE>



proposed compromise or settlement of such claim specifying in detail the nature
and amount of such proposed settlement or compromise. Borrower (and any other
relevant Portfolio Entity) shall be deemed to have approved such proposed
compromise or settlement unless, within 30 days after the date Borrower receives
such notice of intended compromise or settlement, Borrower provides such
Indemnitee or the Required Banks, as the case may be, with (i) a written legal
analysis from counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee or Required
Banks, as the case may be, reasonably concluding that, based on the magnitude of
the Subject Claim, the legal basis for such Subject Claim, and/or the cost of
defending such Subject Claim, the amount of such proposed settlement or
compromise is not within a reasonable range of settlements or compromises for
such Subject Claim, and indicating, based on such factors, such counsel's view
as to the appropriate amount of a reasonable settlement or compromise for such
Subject Claim (the "Settlement Amount"). If the Indemnitee or the Required
Banks, as the case may be, receives such legal analysis required by this Section
within such 30-day period, the Indemnitee or the Required Banks, as the case may
be, may elect to settle or compromise such Subject Claim and Borrower shall be
responsible for the payment of all amounts of such compromise or settlement up
to 125% of the Settlement Amount, such Indemnitee shall be responsible for
payment of all amounts of such compromise or settlement in excess of such 125%
limit and such compromise or settlement shall be binding upon Borrower. If
Borrower does not provide such legal analysis within such period, or if such
legal analysis is not reasonable, in the reasonable determination of such
Indemnitee or the Required Banks, as the case may be, such Indemnitee may settle
or compromise such Subject Claim (and Borrower shall cause any other relevant
Portfolio Entity to agree to the same) and shall be fully indemnified by
Borrower therefor. Such Indemnitee or the Required Banks, as the case may be,
shall not otherwise settle or compromise any such Subject Claim other than at
its own expense.

              5.11.7 Upon payment of any Subject Claim by Borrower pursuant to
this Section 5.11 or other similar indemnity provisions contained herein to or
on behalf of an Indemnitee, Borrower, without any further action, shall be
subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have relating thereto,
and such Indemnitee shall cooperate with Borrower and give such further
assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable Borrower vigorously to pursue
such claims.

              5.11.8 Any amounts payable by Borrower pursuant to this Section
5.11 shall be regularly payable within 30 days after Borrower receives an
invoice for such amounts from any applicable Indemnitee, and if not paid within
such 30-day period shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

              5.11.9 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
Borrower shall not, in connection with any one legal proceeding or claim, or
separate but related proceedings or claims arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, in which the interests of the Indemnitees do not
materially differ, be liable to the Indemnitees (or any of them) under any of
the provisions set forth in this Section 5.11 for the fees and expenses of more
than one separate firm of attorneys (which firm shall be selected by the
affected Indemnitees, or upon failure to so select, by Administrative Agent).

              5.11.10 If, for any reason whatsoever, the indemnification
provided under this Section 5.11 is unavailable to any Indemnitee or is
insufficient to hold it harmless to the extent


                                       73

<PAGE>



provided in this Section 5.11, then provided such payment is not prohibited by
or contrary to any applicable Governmental Rule, Legal Requirement or public
policy, Borrower shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnitee as a result of the Subject Claim in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative economic interests of Borrower and its Affiliates on the
one hand, and such Indemnitee on the other hand, in the matters contemplated by
this Agreement as well as the relative fault of Borrower (and its Affiliates)
and such Indemnitee with respect to such Subject Claim, and any other relevant
equitable considerations.

         5.12 Qualifying Facility/Exempt Wholesale Generator. With respect to
each Project, take or cause to be taken all necessary or appropriate actions (a)
so that such Project will, from and after commercial operations of such Project,
either be a Qualifying Facility or an Eligible Facility until all Obligations
due the Banks under the Credit Documents have been paid in full unless such
Project's failure to be a Qualifying Facility or Eligible Facility, as the case
may be, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
such Project, and (b) except to the extent that the FPA is applicable solely by
reason of the relevant Project Owner being the owner of a Qualifying Facility or
an Exempt Wholesale Generator, to maintain such Project Owner's and such
Project's exemptions from regulation under the FPA (unless failure to so
maintain such exemptions could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Borrower or such Project) and PUHCA (except regulations
specifically applicable to an Exempt Wholesale Generator or a Qualifying
Facility) or, if Calpine or its successor or Borrower becomes a registered
holding company under PUHCA, as a subsidiary of such registered holding company.

         5.13 Construction of Each Project. With respect to each Funded Project,
cause such Project to be constructed and equipped substantially in accordance
with the Plans and Specifications, Construction Contracts, other Project
Documents, Project Budget and the Project Schedule for such Project as the same
may be amended from time to time pursuant to Section 6.13.

         5.14 Completion. With respect to each Funded Project, achieve
Completion and Final Completion of such Project in a timely and diligent manner
in accordance with the Project Schedule, Project Budget, Construction Contracts
and Plans and Specifications of such Project as the same may be extended and, in
the case of Completion, in no event later than the guaranteed completion date
set therefor in such Project's Project Schedule (which shall be extended as the
result of the occurrence of events of force majeure for additional periods up to
an aggregate of 180 days).

         5.15 Operation of Projects and Annual Operating Budget. With respect to
each Funded Project:

              5.15.1 (a) Keep such Project, after Completion thereof, or cause
the same to be kept, in good operating condition consistent with Prudent Utility
Practices, all Applicable Permits (and, if applicable, Applicable Third Party
Permits), Legal Requirements and the Operative Documents, and make or cause to
be made all repairs (structural and non-structural, extraordinary or ordinary)
necessary to keep such Project in such condition; and (b) operate such Project,
after Completion thereof, or cause the same to be operated, in a manner
consistent with Prudent Utility Practices and in compliance with the terms of
the Power Purchase Documents so


                                       74

<PAGE>



as to assure, to the extent reasonably possible, the maximum generation of net
revenue for such Project consistent with the Power Purchase Documents.

              5.15.2 On or before 60 days prior to the first day of the month in
which Completion of such Project occurs or is anticipated to occur and 60 days
prior to the first day of each calendar year thereafter, submit to
Administrative Agent a draft operating plan and a budget, detailed by month for
such Project, of anticipated revenues and anticipated expenditures, such budget
to include debt service (if applicable), proposed distributions, maintenance,
repair and operation expenses (including reasonable allowance for
contingencies), Major Maintenance, reserves and all other anticipated O&M Costs
for such Project for the remainder of the calendar year for the first such plan
and budget and for the ensuing calendar year for each other such plan and budget
and, in the case of Major Maintenance in accordance with Section 5.15.3, to the
conclusion of the second full calendar year thereafter (each such annual
operating plan and budget with respect to each Project and for all the Projects
as a whole, an "Annual Operating Budget"). Each Annual Operating Budget shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Administrative Agent and the Independent
Engineer. Failure by Administrative Agent to approve or disapprove such draft
Annual Operating Budget within 30 days after receipt thereof shall be deemed to
be an approval by Administrative Agent of such draft. Borrower shall incorporate
Administrative Agent's suggestions into a final Annual Operating Budget, which,
subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 5.15.2, shall be
prepared no less than 30 days in advance of each fiscal year. The O&M Costs in
each Annual Operating Budget which are subject to escalation limitations in the
Project Documents shall not, absent extraordinary circumstances, be increased by
more than the amounts provided in such Project Documents. Borrower shall
continue to operate and maintain such Project, or cause such Project to be
operated and maintained, within amounts not to exceed 115% of the aggregate
amounts set forth in the applicable Annual Operating Budget; provided, however,
the costs for fuel shall not be limited by the Annual Operating Budget. Pending
approval of any Annual Operating Budget in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5.15.2, Borrower shall continue to operate and maintain such Project, or
cause such Project to be operated and maintained, within the Annual Operating
Budget for such Project then in effect; provided that the amounts specified
therein shall be increased by the amounts specified in the Project Documents.

              5.15.3 Replace the Operator of such Project if such Operator is
not operating such Project in accordance with the provisions hereof or the
applicable O&M Agreement, Power Purchase Documents or any other agreement or
instrument under which the relevant Project Owner holds title, an easement or a
leasehold to the applicable Site, the Easements or the Collateral, and such
failure could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on such
Project, upon receipt of notice from Administrative Agent (after consultation
with Borrower) to the effect that, in the opinion of the Required Banks and the
Independent Engineer, said Operator has failed to perform any material
obligations set forth above; provided, however, that the Operator may have 30
days from Borrower's receipt of notice to cure said failure (or to establish to
the satisfaction of the Required Banks that a failure does not exist); provided,
further, that if such failure cannot be corrected within such 30 days, the
Required Banks will not unreasonably withhold their consent to an extension of
such time if corrective action is promptly instituted by such Operator within
the 30-day period and thereafter diligently pursued until the failure is
corrected and such extension shall not have a Material Adverse Effect on such
Project.

         5.16 Preservation of Rights; Further Assurances.

              5.16.1 Preserve, protect and defend the rights of the Portfolio
Entities under each material Project Document relating to the Funded Projects
and under each Turbine Purchase Contract relating to the Funded Turbines,
including prosecution of suits to enforce any rights of the Portfolio Entities
thereunder and enforcement of any claims with respect thereto; provided,
however, that upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default if Administrative Agent requests that certain actions be taken and the
Portfolio Entities fail to take the requested actions within five Banking Days
and such failure reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Borrower, any such Project or any such Turbine, Administrative Agent may
enforce in its own name or in the relevant Portfolio Entity's name, such rights
of any Portfolio Entity.

              5.16.2 From time to time, execute, acknowledge, record, register,
deliver and/or file all such notices, statements, instruments and other
documents (including any memorandum of lease or other agreement, financing
statement, continuation statement, certificate of title or estoppel
certificate), relating to the Loans stating the interest and charges then due
and any known defaults, and take such other steps as may be necessary or
advisable to render fully valid and enforceable under all applicable laws the
rights, liens and priorities of the Banks with respect to all Collateral and
other security from time to time furnished under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents or intended to be so furnished, including (x) granting Liens,
subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens, in favor of Administrative
Agent, in any Project or portion thereof not part of the Collateral and (y)
causing its partners, members or shareholders, as the case may be, to grant a
first priority Lien to Administrative Agent in all the ownership interests in a
Portfolio Entity, in each case to the extent permitted, without any waivers, and
consistently with the characterization of the Debt incurred and Liens granted

and the other Credit Documents.

              5.16.5 Cause the Pledged Equity Interests to be "certificated
securities" as defined in Article 8 of the UCC and include in each appropriate

Interests are "securities" (as such term is defined in Article 8 of the UCC)
governed by Article 8 of the UCC.

         5.17 Project Equity.

              5.17.1 (a) Make or cause to be made Contributions with respect to

Contribution (taking into account Contributions made with respect to the
Subsequent Project then being initially funded) and (ii) in an amount equal to
the amount necessary to maintain a Debt to Capitalization Ratio of no more than
the Maximum Debt to Capitalization Ratio, such Contributions to be made at the
time of each Borrowing and (b) make or cause to be made Contributions with

Committed Equity Funds that have not yet been contributed and that would have
otherwise been contributed with respect to all remaining Costs for Funded
Projects and (y) to the extent required by Section 6.4.2(h), an amount equal to
the aggregate remaining progress payments to be made for Funded Turbines at the
time of such acceleration.

procedures to ensure continued compliance with the same. The Portfolio Entities
may contest in good faith any such taxes, assessments and other charges and, in
such event, may permit the taxes, assessments or other charges so contested to
remain unpaid during any period, including appeals, when the Portfolio Entities
are in good faith contesting the same, so long as (a) reserves reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent have been established in an amount
sufficient to pay any such taxes, assessments or other charges, accrued interest
thereon and potential penalties or other costs relating thereto, or other
adequate provision for the payment thereof shall have been made, (b) enforcement

include, or cause to be included, in each Major Project Document or Consent
related thereto and entered into after the Closing Date, provisions to the
effect that each counterparty will pay all Project Revenues or other payments,

associated thereto. Upon receipt of a notice under clause (i) above requesting
the release of any such Turbine and compliance with the conditions thereto,
Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to Borrower such
documents and instruments as may be reasonably necessary to release such Turbine
from the Liens of the Collateral Documents and to permit such transfer of

Projects which have achieved Operation prior to the date such Lien is granted;
provided, however, that in any such case, Borrower shall have the right in its
discretion to prepay or cause to be prepaid the aggregate amount of outstanding

amounts in any Account or otherwise constituting Collateral) and, upon
Administrative Agent's receipt of such payment, to have such Turbine(s) released
from the Liens of the Collateral Documents and to transfer ownership of such
Turbine(s) to Calpine. If Borrower exercises the right in the foregoing proviso,
upon prepayment in full of all such Turbine Purchase Loans, the Banks shall
promptly release such Turbine(s) and consent to the transfer of such Turbine(s)
to Calpine, and Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to
Borrower such documents and instruments as may be reasonably

transmission or transportation of power, gas, water or other inputs or outputs
to or from a Project, (ii) access to or from the Project, or (iii) the provision
of other services to the Project, to a Governmental Authority, local utility or
similar Person, so long as the Technical Committee is satisfied that the
transmission or transportation of such commodities, access and the provision of
such other services to or from the Project will not be adversely affected as a
result of such conveyance. In the event of such transfer and conveyance,
Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to Borrower such documents and
instruments, including UCC-3 termination statements and deeds of reconveyance,
as reasonably may be necessary to release such real estate interests and related
portions of the Collateral from the Liens under the Credit Agreement.

order to enable one or more Project Owners to pay amounts due the applicable
Equipment Finance Company pursuant to an Equipment Lease, such payments under
the applicable Equipment Lease shall not be considered Project Revenues, and if
and to the extent that such payments are not used to pay the purchase price for
such equipment to the vendor thereof, and are in excess of all other
Contributions then required to be made in accordance with this Agreement,

              6.13.2 Without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent
direct or consent to any change order under any of the Major Construction
Contracts relating to a Funded Project or a Funded Turbine if such change order:

                     (a) in the case of a Funded Project, will, individually or
together with all previous change orders, increase or decrease the Project Costs
of a particular Funded Project by more than $2,500,000 in the aggregate
(exclusive of increases reimbursed by insurance awards, condemnation awards or
contractual damage awards); provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Borrower or a Project Owner may direct or consent to any such change order
without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent if such change order
will not individually increase the Project Costs of a particular Funded Project
by more than $250,000 and such change order, together with all previous change
orders, will not increase the Project Costs of such Funded Project by more than
$5,000,000 in the aggregate (in each case, exclusive of increases reimbursed by
insurance awards, condemnation awards or contractual damage awards);

                     (b) in the case of a Funded Turbine, will, individually or
together with all previous change orders, increase or decrease the Turbine Costs

modification or impair the enforceability of any warranty under any Major
Construction Contract, any Maintenance Contract or any O&M Agreement relating to
a Funded Project or any warranty under any Turbine Purchase Contract relating to
a Funded Turbine, in each case if such modification or impairment could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on a Funded Project;

                     (e) is reasonably likely, in the opinion of the Independent
Engineer, to impair or reduce the maximum capacity, efficiency, output,
performance, reliability, durability or availability of any Funded Project or
Funded Turbine, or increase O&M Costs associated with any Funded Project, or
decrease Project Revenues from any Funded Project, in each case after

Turbine Purchase Contractor, as the case may be, or (ii) materially increase any
obligation of any Portfolio Entity thereunder;

                     (g) is likely, in the reasonable opinion of Administrative
Agent, to present a significant risk of the revocation or material modification
of any Applicable Permit or Third Party Permit relating to a Funded Project or
jeopardize any Project's status as a Qualifying Facility or an Eligible
Facility, as the case may be;

                     (h) may cause any Funded Project or Funded Turbine not to
comply or lessen any such Project's or Turbine's ability to comply with Legal
Requirements; or

Portfolio Entity and an Affiliate of Borrower.

              6.13.3 Declare "Completion", "Final Construction Completion",
"Final Project Completion" or "Mechanical Completion" (as such terms are defined
in the Construction Contracts) under the Construction Contracts relating to a
Funded Project or declare that the "Acceptance Date" has occurred or approve the
successful completion of the "Acceptance Tests" relating to a Funded Project (as
such terms are defined in the Construction Contracts) without the written
approval of Administrative Agent acting in consultation with the Independent
Engineer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

              6.13.4 Consent, without Administrative Agent's prior approval, to
(a) any action taken by any Contractor or Turbine Purchase Contractor to conform
the equipment or services provided by such Person to the intellectual property
rights of others if such action could reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect a Portfolio Entity's continued use of any Funded Project or
Funded Turbine or (b) to the settlement by any Contractor or Turbine Purchase
Contractor of any claim or proceeding which could reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect a Portfolio Entity's rights relating to a Funded
Project or a Funded Turbine.

              6.13.5 Direct any Major Contractor or Turbine Purchase Contractor
to suspend the work being performed under any Construction Contract or any
Turbine Purchase Contract relating to a Funded Project or a Funded Turbine
without Administrative Agent's prior consent.

Wherever Administrative Agent is required to approve or consent to any change

to such Project, except (a) with the prior written consent of Administrative
Agent acting at the direction of the Technical Committee, and (b) if required by
Administrative Agent, upon delivery to Administrative Agent of a Consent from
such third party in substantially the form of Exhibit E-1; provided that the

                              APPLICATION OF FUNDS

         7.1  Construction Account.

              7.1.1 Establishment of Account. Borrower and Administrative Agent
have established the Construction Account at the Depositary Agent's New York
office and within the Construction Account a sub-account for each Initial
Project and the Lost Pines Project. On or prior to the initial funding of
Construction Loans in respect of a Subsequent Project, Borrower and
Administrative Agent shall establish a sub-account within the Construction
Account for such Project and, on or prior to the initial funding of Turbine
Purchase Loans in respect of a Turbine, Borrower and Administrative Agent shall
establish a sub-account within the Construction Account for such Turbine (a
"Turbine Purchase Sub-Account" and, each sub-account established pursuant to the
two preceding sentences, a "Construction Sub-Account"). Subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the applicable provisions of Article 3 in respect of
the applicable


                                       90

<PAGE>



Project or Turbine, as the case may be, there shall be deposited into each
Construction Sub-Account the proceeds of all Loans made hereunder in respect of
the corresponding Project or, in the case of each Turbine Purchase Sub-Account,
the corresponding Turbine, and all amounts required to be deposited in such
Construction Sub-Account pursuant to Sections 3.10(a), 5.1.2 and 5.17.

              7.1.2  Disbursements from Construction Account. Amounts shall be
disbursed from each Construction Sub-Account from time to time as provided in
this Section 7.1. Borrower shall have the right to cause Administrative Agent
(a) to disburse amounts from the Construction Sub-Account for the corresponding
Project to the accounts of each of the Contractors performing work on such
Project for amounts due and owing to such Contractors under the Construction
Contracts, or to any other materialmen, subcontractors, Administrative Agent or
any other Person performing work on such Project in payment of amounts due and
owing to such parties in respect of such Project in accordance with a duly
completed Construction Drawdown Certificate, (b) to transfer up to $250,000 in
any month from the Construction Sub-Account with respect to a Project to the
Operating Account with respect to such Project to pay specified amounts of less
than $50,000, individually, (c) to maintain up to $100,000 in any Operating
Account by transferring amounts from the corresponding Construction Sub-Account
to pay unspecified amounts (the expenditure of which shall be identified, and
substantiated to the reasonable satisfaction of Administrative Agent in the
immediately subsequent Construction Drawdown Certificate), (d) to disburse
amounts from the Turbine Purchase Sub-Account for the corresponding Turbine to
the account of the Turbine Purchase Contractor performing work with respect to
such Turbine in payment for amounts due and owing to such Turbine Purchase
Contractor under the Turbine Purchase Contract in accordance with a duly
completed Turbine Purchase Drawdown Certificate, and (e) to transfer amounts (i)
from the Construction Sub-Account for the corresponding Project to the Operating
Account with respect to such Project for payment by Borrower of amounts due and
owing to Contractors under the Construction Contracts or to any other
materialmen, subcontractors or other Persons performing work on such Project of
amounts due and owing to such parties in respect of such Project in accordance
with a duly completed Construction Drawdown Certificate and (ii) from the
Turbine Purchase Sub-Account for the corresponding Turbine to the Operating
Account for payment by Borrower of amounts due and owing to the Turbine Purchase
Contractor performing work with respect to such Turbine for amounts due and
owing to such Turbine Purchase Contractor under the Turbine Purchase Contract in
accordance with a duly completed Turbine Purchase Drawdown Certificate. Borrower
agrees that, where Administrative Agent has not transferred such amounts to the
relevant Operating Account pursuant to clause (e) above, Administrative Agent
may transfer any or all of a Loan and other sums in the applicable Construction
Sub-Account directly into the account of any Contractor or Turbine Purchase
Contractor, as the case may be, for amounts due and owing to such Person under
the relevant Construction Contract or Turbine Purchase Contract, as the case may
be, or any other materialmen or subcontractors in payment of amounts due and
owing to such parties in respect of the applicable Project or Turbine without
further authorization from Borrower; provided, however, that if Borrower has
notified Administrative Agent that it is contesting a claim for payment by any
such Person or a subcontractor or materialmen in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement and the definition of "Permitted Liens,"
Administrative Agent will not, except as described in the proviso to the next
sentence, be entitled to pay any amount being contested. Borrower hereby
constitutes and appoints Administrative Agent its true and


                                       91

<PAGE>



lawful attorney-in-fact to make such direct payments and this power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable;
provided that, except upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of
Default or a Non-Fundamental Project Default with respect to the relevant
Project, Administrative Agent shall not exercise its rights under this power of
attorney except to make payments (a) as directed by Borrower or (b) which
Administrative Agent reasonably believes, if not promptly made, are reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the applicable Project. No further
direction or authorization from Borrower shall be necessary to warrant or permit
Administrative Agent to make such direct Loans in accordance with the foregoing
sentence, and all such direct Loans shall satisfy pro tanto the obligations of
Administrative Agent and the Banks hereunder, and shall be secured by the
Collateral Documents as fully as if made directly to Borrower, regardless of the
disposition thereof by any Contractor, Turbine Purchase Contractor, or any other
subcontractors, materialmen, laborers or other parties. Upon Completion of a
Project, any amounts remaining in the applicable Construction Sub-Account in
excess of amounts necessary to pay for "punchlist" items for such Project shall,
at Borrower's option, (i) be transferred to the Construction Sub-Account for
another Project, (ii) be transferred to the relevant sub-account of the Revenue
Account, and/or (iii) be applied to prepay Loans. Upon Final Completion of a
Project, any amounts remaining in the Construction Sub-Account for such Project
shall be transferred to the relevant sub-account of the Revenue Account. At any
time when there exists no remaining Turbine Costs for a Funded Turbine, any
amounts remaining in the corresponding Turbine Purchase Sub-Account shall, at
Borrower's option, (i) be transferred to the Construction Sub-Account for
another Turbine, (ii) be transferred to the Construction Sub-Account for a
Project, and/or (iii) be applied to prepay Loans; provided, in the case of
clause (ii) of this sentence, the Turbine Purchase Loans corresponding to such
transferred amounts shall be deemed Construction Loans in the manner set forth
in Section 2.3.5.

              7.1.3  Rights of Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent will
have the right, but not the obligation, to (a) supply any missing endorsements
of Borrower, refuse any item for deposit except as required by the terms of this
Agreement, and pay and charge items payable by Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 7.1.2 in any order convenient to Administrative Agent; (b) refuse to
honor any check drawn on the Construction Account or any sub-account therein
which is not consistent with this Agreement, or which has been improperly filled
out or endorsed; (c) create and charge to the Construction Account or the
applicable Construction Sub-Account overdrafts and all applicable charges; (d)
remit copies of checks and other items with statements instead of the originals
which may be retained by Administrative Agent; and (e) pay fees, interest and
other charges owing by Borrower.

         7.2  Revenue Account.

              7.2.1  Establishment of Account; Priority of Payments. Borrower
and Administrative Agent have established the Revenue Account at the Depositary
Agent's New York office and within the Revenue Account a sub-account for each
Initial Project and the Lost Pines Project. On or prior to the initial funding
of Construction Loans in respect of a Subsequent Project, Borrower and
Administrative Agent shall establish a sub-account within the Revenue Account
for such Project. There shall be deposited into the Revenue Account the amounts
specified in Section 5.1.2 and the applicable portion of withdrawals from time
to time from the Working Capital Reserve Account pursuant to Section 7.8.3. So
long as no Event of Default has


                                       92

<PAGE>



occurred and is continuing, or will occur upon giving effect to the application
described below, funds in the Revenue Account shall be applied at the following
times and in the following order of priority by disbursement or internal account
transfer by the Depositary Agent, (a) on Administrative Agent's volition with
respect to Waterfall Levels 1 through 6 and 8 or if Administrative Agent
reasonably believes that failure to make any such payment could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Borrower or a
Project, or (b) pursuant to a disbursement requisition executed by Borrower,
directly to the Person entitled thereto, in each case at the following times,
commencing on the date funds are first deposited in the Revenue Account, and in
the following order of priority (each, a "Waterfall Level"):

                     (1) from time to time, provided that Administrative Agent
has timely received and approved a Disbursement Requisition delivered pursuant
to Section 7.2.2, amounts in the Revenue Account shall be transferred to a
Project's Operating Account for payment of Senior O&M Costs incurred with
respect to such Project in an amount determined pursuant to Section 7.2.2 below;

                     (2) as and when due under the terms of this Agreement, from
the Revenue Account to the payment of all fees, costs, charges and any other
amounts due and payable to Administrative Agent, LC Bank and the Banks in
connection with this Agreement and the other Credit Documents;

                     (3) as and when due, on a pro rata basis among the Banks,
from the Revenue Account to the payment of interest on the Loans and on
Reimbursement Obligations;

                     (4) as and when due, from the Revenue Account, to repayment
of the Reimbursement Obligations incurred in connection with Letters of Credit;

                     (5) on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, as
and to the extent requested by Borrower, from the Revenue Account to the Working
Capital Reserve Account as required by Section 7.8;

                     (6) on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, in
the event that the conditions to distributions set forth in Section 6.6 have
been satisfied, provided that Administrative Agent has timely received and
approved a Disbursement Requisition delivered pursuant to Section 7.2.2, and as
and to the extent requested by Borrower from the Revenue Account to the payment
of Subordinated O&M Costs in an amount determined pursuant to Section 7.2.3
below;

                     (7) on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, in
the event that the conditions to distributions set forth in Section 6.6 have
been satisfied, for payment of obligations owed to Persons that are not
Affiliates of Borrower and which obligations have been approved by the Technical
Committee in its sole discretion;

                     (8) on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, in
the event that the conditions to distributions set forth in Section 6.6 have
been satisfied, for payment to Borrower or distribution by Borrower in amounts
described in and for application in accordance with Section 6.6;


                                       93

<PAGE>



                     (9) on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, on a
pro rata basis among the Banks, to the prepayment of principal amounts of the
Loans outstanding; and

                     (10) on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter,
provided no Loans are then outstanding, to Borrower.

To the extent reasonably practicable, funds in the various sub-accounts of the
Revenue Account shall be applied at each Waterfall Level to costs, payments or
other uses as described in such Waterfall Level related or attributable to the
Project to which such sub-account relates; provided, if funds in any such
sub-account are insufficient for such application, Borrower or Administrative
Agent may apply funds in other sub-accounts of the Revenue Account to such
application; provided further, however, that the Lien of the Collateral
Documents on the Project Revenues from a particular Project shall not secure
Obligations relating to or arising from Projects owned by Project Owners that
own one or more Projects that had achieved Operation prior to the date such Lien
was granted to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks pursuant to the
Credit Documents.

              7.2.2  O&M Costs. Sums shall be transferred to the Operating
Accounts for the payment of Senior O&M Costs as provided in this Section 7.2.2.
On or before the fifth Banking Day prior to the last Banking Day of each month
during which Borrower desires to transfer sums to the Operating Account for the
corresponding Project for the payment of Senior O&M Costs incurred in respect of
the corresponding Project, Borrower shall submit to Administrative Agent a
certificate in the form of Exhibit C-10 detailing the amounts to be so
transferred ("Disbursement Requisition"), which amounts shall not exceed the
Senior O&M Costs incurred in respect of the corresponding Project which have
become, or are anticipated to become, due and payable during such month.
Administrative Agent shall review such Disbursement Requisition within five
Banking Days following receipt thereof, and shall transfer the amounts specified
therein to the applicable Operating Account for application in accordance with
Waterfall Level 1 to the extent that such expenditures are in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Annual Operating Budget and this Agreement, as such
budget may be exceeded pursuant to the terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 7.2.2 to the contrary, the transfers to, and expenditures from, the
Revenue Account or a sub-account therein for Senior O&M Costs (other than O&M
Costs incurred in an emergency and fuel costs and netting any O&M Costs
consisting of payments under Equipment Leases against the corresponding Project
Revenues resulting from such payments) payable pursuant to Waterfall Level 1
shall not, without Administrative Agent's consent, exceed 115% of the aggregate
amounts specified in such Annual Operating Budget. Borrower shall promptly pay
or cause to be paid all Senior O&M Costs in excess of the amounts permitted
under the preceding sentence by Contributions of additional funds; provided,
however, that if Administrative Agent subsequently approves a variation in such
Annual Operating Budget which would have allowed the payment of such excess
Senior O&M Costs, Borrower shall be entitled to recover any such Senior O&M
Costs previously paid by Contributions of additional funds at Waterfall Level 1.
Each Disbursement Requisition shall reflect a reduction in the Senior O&M Costs
for which Borrower requests that funds be transferred to the Operating Account
during such month for any amounts which remain, or are expected to remain, in
the applicable Operating Account at the end of any month as a result of a
previous Disbursement Requisition.

              7.2.3  Subordinated O&M Costs. On or before the fifth Banking Day
prior to the end of each calendar quarter on which Borrower desires to make
payments of Subordinated O&M Costs, Borrower shall include in the Disbursement
Requisition submitted pursuant to Section 7.2.2 on such date the amounts to be
so paid, which amounts shall not exceed the Subordinated O&M Costs which have
become due and payable. Administrative Agent shall review such Disbursement
Requisition within five Banking Days following receipt thereof, and, to the
extent funds exist in the Revenue Account after application of amounts in such
account to Waterfall Levels 1 through 5, make payment of the Subordinated O&M
Costs specified therein in accordance with Section 7.2.1 to the designated payee
thereof to the extent that such expenditures are in accordance with the terms of
the relevant Annual Operating Budget.

              7.2.4  Mandatory Prepayment.

                     (a) If on the last Banking Day of any calendar quarter, an
Event of Default shall exist, Borrower shall use all amounts, if any, in the
Revenue Account and all sub-accounts thereof at such time after application of
amounts in such account to Waterfall Levels 1 through 5 (i) to prepay the Loans
(and the Reimbursement Obligations, pro rata), and (ii) upon repayment in full
of the Loans and the Reimbursement Obligations, to repay all other Obligations
of Borrower to the Banks, as designated by Administrative Agent and the Required
Banks.

                     (b) Nothing in this Section 7.2.4 shall limit in any manner
the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and the Banks upon and during
the continuation of an Event of Default under this Agreement.

         7.3  Operating Account.

              7.3.1  Establishment of Account. On or prior to (a) the Effective
Date for the Initial Projects and the Lost Pines Project and (b) the Funding
Date for each other Subsequent Project, the relevant Project Owner and
Administrative Agent shall establish at a mutually acceptable financial
institution an account entitled "[RELEVANT] Project -- Operating Account" (each,
an "Operating Account" and collectively, the "Operating Accounts").

              7.3.2  Funding. From time to time, in accordance with Section
7.1.2 or the provisions of the Waterfall Levels, Borrower shall cause to be
transferred to the Operating Accounts the amounts specified in Sections 7.1.2,
7.2.1 and 7.2.2, as the case may be.

              7.3.3  Withdrawals. The relevant Project Owner shall be entitled
to withdraw amounts from an Operating Account (a) to pay Project Costs for the
corresponding Project in accordance with Section 7.1.2 or (b) to pay Senior O&M
Costs for the corresponding Project which have become due and payable in respect
of such Project in accordance with the Disbursement Requisition in which such
Senior O&M Costs were described. Amounts transferred to an Operating Account for
the payment of Project Costs which are not, for any reason, applied to the
payment of Project Costs pursuant to the Construction Drawdown Certificate
pursuant to which such amounts were transferred, shall be retained in such
Operating Account for application to the following month's Project Costs in
accordance with Section 7.1.2. Amounts transferred to an Operating Account for
the payment of Senior O&M Costs which are not, for any reason, applied to the
payment of Senior O&M Costs in accordance with the


                                       95

<PAGE>



Disbursement Requisition pursuant to which such amounts were transferred, shall
be retained in such Operating Account for application to the following month's
Senior O&M Costs in accordance with Section 7.2.2.

              7.3.4  Security Interest. Each Operating Account shall be
established in a state in which the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in such
state governs the creation, perfection and priority of security interests in
"Deposit Accounts" (as defined in such Uniform Commercial Code), and each
Operating Account shall be maintained as a "Deposit Account" in accordance with
such Uniform Commercial Code. The relevant Project Owner shall execute and
deliver such documents and instruments as Administrative Agent shall reasonably

establish within the Loss Proceeds Account a sub-account for each Initial
Project and the Lost Pines Project. On or prior to the initial funding of
Construction Loans in respect of a Subsequent Project, Borrower and
Administrative Agent shall establish a sub-account within the Loss Proceeds
Account for such Project. Except where a Project Document for a Funded Project
that is not directly or indirectly wholly-owned by Borrower may, with the
approval of the Technical Committee, direct otherwise, all Insurance Proceeds,
Eminent Domain Proceeds and damage payments described in Section 7.7 shall be
deposited in the appropriate subaccount in the Loss Proceeds Account and applied
(a) as specified in Sections 7.5 through 7.7 and (b) if no such application is
specified, to the prepayment of the Loans, and thereafter to payment of all
other Obligations of Borrower.

casualties as provided in Section 5.4.4 and any other casualty as to which
Insurance Proceeds have been made available. Borrower shall keep Administrative
Agent timely apprised of insurance claim proceedings. All amounts and proceeds
(including instruments) in respect of the proceeds of any insurance policy
required to be maintained by a Portfolio Entity hereunder (including the pro
rata portion of such amounts received under any policy maintained by a Joint
Venture) ("Insurance Proceeds") shall be applied as provided in this Section 7.5
except where a Project Document for a Funded Project that is not directly or
indirectly wholly-owned by Borrower may, with the approval of the Technical
Committee, direct otherwise. Except where a Project Document for a Funded
Project that is not directly or indirectly wholly-owned by a Borrower may, with
the approval of the Technical Committee, direct otherwise, and except as set
forth in Section 7.5.9, all Insurance Proceeds (or, in the case of a Project
that is not wholly-owned by a Portfolio Entity, such Portfolio Entity's share of
such Insurance Proceeds) shall be paid by the insurers directly to
Administrative Agent (as loss payee or additional insured as provided in Exhibit
K). If any Insurance Proceeds required to be paid to Administrative Agent
pursuant to the preceding sentence are paid directly to any Portfolio Entity,
Calpine or any other Person with respect to any Project or Turbine by any
insurer, such Insurance Proceeds shall be received only in trust for
Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of the Portfolio
Entities, Calpine or such other Person, as the case may be, and Borrower shall
cause such amounts to be forthwith paid over to Administrative Agent in the same
form as received (with any necessary


                                       96

endorsement). To the fullest extent that it effectively may do so under
applicable law, Administrative Agent shall apply all such Insurance Proceeds in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5.

Proceeds relate shall be deposited into the Construction Sub-Account for such
Project for application in accordance with Section 7.1 and (ii) on or after
Completion of the Project to which such Insurance Proceeds relate shall be
deposited into the Revenue Account for application in accordance with Section
7.2.

              7.5.3  Applications; Mandatory Prepayments. All Insurance Proceeds
(other than those described in Sections 7.5.2, 7.5.4 and 7.5.9) and all Eminent
Domain Proceeds shall be applied (a) to the prepayment of Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations, pro rata, and (b) to the payment of all other
Obligations of Borrower, unless, with respect to a Project, each of the
following conditions are satisfied or waived by Administrative Agent, or the
Required Banks, as required pursuant to Section 7.5.5 or 7.5.6, in which event
such amounts shall be applied to the repair or restoration of the Project to
which such Insurance Proceeds or Eminent Domain Proceeds relate in accordance
with the terms of such subsections:

                     (a) such damage or destruction does not constitute the
destruction of all or substantially all of the man-made portion of the Project
to which such Insurance Proceeds or Eminent Domain Proceeds relate;

                     (b) neither a Non-Fundamental Project Default or a
Non-Fundamental Project Inchoate Default with respect to the damaged or
destroyed Project nor an Inchoate Default or an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and after giving effect to any proposed repair and
restoration, such damage or destruction or proposed repair and restoration will
not result in a Non-Fundamental Project Default or Non-Fundamental Project
Inchoate Default with respect to such Project or an Event of Default or an
Inchoate Default;

                     (c) Borrower and the Independent Engineer certify, and
Administrative Agent (with, if applicable, the consent of the Required Banks)
determines in its reasonable judgment, that repair or restoration of the Project
to which such Insurance Proceeds or Eminent Domain Proceeds relate is
technically and economically feasible within a twelve-month period and that a
sufficient amount of funds is or will be available to Borrower and the relevant
Project Owner and, if applicable, the Joint Venturer to make repairs and
restorations; provided, however, that if such Project is not wholly-owned by a
Project Owner, then the Joint Venture Agreement shall, unless otherwise approved
by the Technical Committee, require the other Persons owning an interest in such
Project to use their share of Insurance Proceeds or Eminent Domain Proceeds for
the repair or restoration of such Project;

                     (d) Borrower certifies, and Administrative Agent (with, if
applicable, the consent of the Required Banks) determines in its reasonable
judgment, that a sufficient amount of funds is or will be available to Borrower
to make all payments of Debt Service which will become due during, if any, and
following repair period and to maintain the Four-Quarter

Projections, unless the Required Banks agree otherwise;

                     (e) if such damage or destruction occurs prior to the
Completion of a Project, such repair or restoration will not adversely affect,
in the reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent in consultation with the
Independent Engineer, achievement of Completion in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents;

                     (f) no Permit is necessary to proceed with the repair and
restoration of the Project to which such Insurance Proceeds or Eminent Domain
Proceeds relate and no material amendment to the Project Documents, or, except
with the consent of the Required Banks, this Agreement or any of the Credit
Documents, and no other instrument is necessary for the purpose of effecting the
repairs or restorations of the Project to which such Insurance Proceeds or
Eminent Domain Proceeds relate or subjecting the repairs or restorations to the
Liens of the applicable Collateral Documents and maintaining the priority of
such Liens or, if any of the above is necessary, Borrower will be able to obtain
the same as and when required;

                     (g) Administrative Agent shall receive an opinion of
counsel acceptable to Administrative Agent opining as to the Permits described
in paragraph (f) above, and an opinion to the effect that such repairs or
restoration (to the extent constituting Collateral) will be subject to the Liens
of the applicable Collateral Documents at the same level of priority as the
other Collateral; and

                     (h) Administrative Agent shall receive such additional
title insurance, title insurance endorsements, mechanic's lien waivers,
certificates, opinions or other matters as it may reasonably request as
necessary or appropriate in connection with such repairs or restoration of the
Project to which such Insurance Proceeds or Eminent Domain Proceeds relate or to
preserve or protect the Banks' interests hereunder and in the applicable
Collateral.

damage or destruction of a Project with respect to which Insurance Proceeds
received by the Portfolio Entities for any single loss not in excess of

              7.5.5  Proceeds in Excess of $1,000,000, Not in Excess of
$10,000,000. Provided that the conditions set forth in Section 7.5.3 have been
waived by Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer, or have been
acknowledged by such Persons as having been satisfied, if there shall occur any
damage or destruction of a Project with respect to which Insurance Proceeds
received by the Portfolio Entities for any single loss in excess of $1,000,000,
but not in excess of $10,000,000, are payable, such Insurance Proceeds received
by the Portfolio Entities shall be held by Administrative Agent in the Loss
Proceeds Account and released by Administrative Agent to Borrower in accordance
with Section 7.5.7.

              7.5.6  Proceeds in Excess of $10,000,000. Provided that the

the Required Banks and the


                                       98

<PAGE>



Independent Engineer, or have been acknowledged by such Persons as having been
satisfied, if there shall occur any damage or destruction of a Project with
respect to which Insurance Proceeds for any single loss in excess of $10,000,000
are payable, such Insurance Proceeds shall be held by Administrative Agent in
the Loss Proceeds Account and released by Administrative Agent to Borrower in
accordance with Section 7.5.7.

              7.5.7  Repair and Restoration Procedures. Amounts which are to be
applied to repair or restoration of a Project pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall
be disbursed by Administrative Agent from the Loss Proceeds Account in
accordance with the following procedures:

                     (a) Borrower shall cause any repairs or restoration to be
commenced and completed promptly and diligently either using Insurance Proceeds
as contemplated in paragraph (b) below or, to the extent such proceeds are not,
or have not yet been made, available, using Borrower's funds;

                     (b) From time to time (after Administrative Agent or the
Required Banks, if applicable, shall have duly approved the making of such
repairs or restoration), Administrative Agent's authorization of release of
Insurance Proceeds for application toward such repairs or restoration shall be
conditioned upon Borrower's written request and the presentation to
Administrative Agent of all documents, certificates and information with respect
to such Insurance Proceeds which would be required in order to obtain a Loan
under this Agreement, including a certificate from Borrower (i) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the repairs or restoration to be effected with
such release, (ii) stating the cost of such repairs or restoration and the
specific amount requested to be paid over to or upon the order of Borrower and
that such amount is requested to pay the cost thereof, (iii) stating that the
aggregate amount requested by Borrower in respect of such repairs or restoration
(when added to any other Insurance Proceeds received by the Portfolio Entities
or otherwise made available to a Project in respect of such damage or
destruction) does not exceed the cost of such repairs or restoration and that a
sufficient amount of funds is or will be available to the Portfolio Entities to
complete the applicable Project, and (iv) stating that neither a Non-Fundamental
Project Inchoate Default with respect to the damaged or destroyed Project nor an
Inchoate Default has occurred and is continuing other than a Non-Fundamental
Project Default with respect to such Project or an Event of Default resulting
solely from such damage or destruction.

              7.5.8  Excess Insurance Proceeds. If, after Insurance Proceeds
have been applied to the repair or restoration of a Project as provided in
Sections 7.5.4, 7.5.5 or 7.5.6, the Banks in consultation with the Independent
Consultants determine that such Project will be able to operate at a level
enabling Borrower to satisfy its obligations hereunder as well as before the
damage or destruction, any excess Insurance Proceeds shall be paid into the
Revenue Account. In the event that the Banks in consultation with the
Independent Engineer determine otherwise, such excess Insurance Proceeds shall
be applied (a) to the prepayment of Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, pro
rata, and (b) to the payment of all other Obligations of Borrower.

              7.5.9  Turbine Insurance Proceeds. Any Insurance Proceeds related
to Turbines shall be distributed directly to Borrower, provided that, with
respect to a Funded Turbine, Borrower pays to Administrative Agent the aggregate
amount of the Turbine Purchase Loans then outstanding with respect to such
Turbine. Upon satisfaction of the foregoing condition,


                                       99

<PAGE>



Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to Borrower such documents and
instruments as may be reasonably necessary to release such Turbine from the
Liens of the Collateral Documents and to permit such transfer of ownership.

              7.5.10 Events of Default. If a Non-Fundamental Project Default
with respect to the damaged or destroyed Project or an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, then any provisions of this Sections 7.5 to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Insurance Proceeds (including any Permitted
Investments made with such proceeds, which shall be liquidated in such manner as
the Banks shall deem reasonable and prudent under the circumstances) may be
applied by Administrative Agent (a) to curing such Non-Fundamental Project
Default or Event of Default, and any Insurance Proceeds remaining thereafter
shall be applied as provided in this Section 7.5 or (b) if such Non-Fundamental
Project Default or Event of Default cannot be cured, toward payment of all other
Obligations of Borrower, in connection with exercise of the Banks' remedies
pursuant to Article 8.

         7.6  Application of Eminent Domain Proceeds. All amounts and proceeds

to Completion of the Project in respect of which they were received, be
deposited in the Construction Account and applied pursuant to Section 7.1 or (b)
if received after Completion of such Project, be deposited in the Revenue
Account and applied pursuant to Section 7.2.1. All performance related
liquidated damages (or, in the case of a Project that is not wholly-owned by a

including all payments in lieu of performance related liquidated damages payable
by Calpine pursuant to clause (vii) of the definition of "Completion", shall be

other Obligations of Borrower.

              7.7.2  Power Purchasers. All damage payments made by Power
Marketer or any other purchaser of the power generated by a Project in
satisfaction of such party's obligations under its purchase agreement (or, in
the case of a Project that is not wholly-owned by a Portfolio Entity, such
Portfolio Entity's share of such damage payments,) shall (a) to the extent such
damages are intended to replace lost revenues, be deposited in the Revenue
Account for application as provided in Section 7.2, and (b) otherwise, applied
to (i) the prepayment of Loans and the Reimbursement Obligations, pro rata, and
(ii) to the extent that all such Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, as
applicable, have been prepaid, applied to the other Obligations of Borrower.

wholly-owned by a Portfolio Entity, such Portfolio Entity's share of such
proceeds), to the prepayment of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, pro

Administrative Agent shall establish a sub-account within the Working Capital
Reserve Account for such Project.

              7.8.2  Funding. On the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter,
Borrower shall cause such portion as Borrower may direct of the amounts then in
the Revenue Account in excess of the amounts applied through Waterfall Level 4

the applicable Project's Project Budget approved by the Lead Arrangers or the
Technical Committee, as the case may be, with respect to the Initial Projects,
the Lost Pines Project or pursuant to Article 3, as applicable, contains initial
working capital as an approved Project Cost, such amounts up to the Working
Capital Reserve Requirement shall be deposited into the Working Capital Reserve
Account on the Completion Date with respect to such Project.

              7.8.3  Withdrawals. Borrower shall be entitled to submit a duly
executed Reserve Account Disbursement Requisition in substantially the form of
Exhibit C-11 (a "Reserve Account Disbursement Requisition") in order to withdraw

year, or as otherwise approved by Administrative Agent and the Independent
Engineer. To the extent reasonably practicable, funds in the various
sub-accounts of the Working Capital Reserve Account shall be applied to costs,
payments or other uses as described in this Section 7.8 related or attributable
to the Project to which such sub-account relates; provided, if funds in any such
sub-account are insufficient for such application, Borrower or Administrative
Agent may apply funds in other sub-accounts of the Working Capital Reserve
Account to such application.

Reserve Account shall accrue to the Working Capital Reserve Account up to the
Working Capital Reserve Requirement and shall thereafter be deposited in the
Revenue Account.

pledges, assigns and transfers to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks
and grants to Depositary Agent on behalf of the Banks a security interest in and
to all of its right, title and interest in and to all Insurance Proceeds and
Eminent Domain Proceeds (to the extent permitted under the Calpine Indenture)
(collectively, "Proceeds"), Accounts, Sub-Accounts and contents of Accounts and
Sub-Accounts, as security for the Loans and the full and faithful performance of
all of Borrower's obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.
Borrower shall not have any rights or powers with respect to any Account except
to have funds on deposit therein applied or distributed in accordance with this
Agreement. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to reduce to cash any
Permitted Investment (without regard to maturity) in order to make any
application required by any section of this Article 7 or otherwise pursuant to
the Credit Documents. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, Administrative Agent shall have all rights and powers with respect
to Proceeds, the Accounts and the contents of the Accounts as it has with
respect to any other Collateral and may apply such amounts to the payment of
interest, principal, fees, costs, charges or other amounts due or payable to
Administrative Agent or the Banks with respect to the Loans in such order as the
Required Banks may elect in their sole discretion. If such Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, until such time as the Required Banks so elect to
exercise such rights and powers, amounts in the Revenue Account shall continue
to be applied by Administrative Agent to the payment categories specified in
Waterfall Levels 1 (to the extent of actual Senior O&M Costs payable to third
parties that are not Affiliates of Borrower) and 2 through 5 and Level 9, and,
to the extent that Administrative Agent, as directed by the Required Banks
acting in their sole discretion, so elects Waterfall Levels 6, 7, 8 and 10.
Borrower shall not have any rights or powers with respect to such amounts except
as expressly provided in this Article 7.

the Accounts; provided that the relevant Project Owners shall be permitted to
maintain the Operating Accounts in accordance with Section 7.3.

         7.11 Earnings on Accounts. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including with respect to the Revenue Account and the Operating
Accounts, all earnings on funds in any Account maintained hereunder shall, on
the last day of each calendar quarter, be deposited in the Revenue Account.

thereunder (including Permitted Investments therein) shall at all times be under
the exclusive dominion and control of the Depositary Agent.

         7.13 Termination of Commitments. Upon repayment in full of all
Obligations and expiration or irrevocable termination of all Commitments,
Administrative Agent shall disburse


                                       102

<PAGE>



any amounts on deposit in the Accounts to Borrower, or, if applicable, as
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

         7.14 Flow of Funds Between Portfolio Entities.

                     (a) All proceeds of Loans, Contributions and any other
amounts utilized by Borrower with respect to the Funded Projects or the Funded
Turbines in accordance with this Agreement, including amounts disbursed from the
Accounts in accordance with this Article 7, shall be permitted and may be made
or transferred by or at the direction of Borrower to the applicable Portfolio
Entity, and, except for Loans attributed to Funded Projects or Funded Turbines
directly owned by Borrower, shall constitute loans, in each case subordinated to
the Obligations, among the relevant Portfolio Entities.

                     (b) Borrower shall use its good faith reasonable efforts to
cause all Project Revenues, Insurance Proceeds, Eminent Domain Proceeds, damage
payments (including delay or performance liquidated damage payments) and any
other amounts due any Portfolio Entity to be paid or otherwise delivered by such
Persons making such payment or delivery directly to Borrower for deposit in the
Accounts as required pursuant to this Agreement. Upon the receipt of such
amounts by Borrower, such amounts shall be deemed repayments of amounts due and
owing under the corresponding loans described in Section 7.14(a) above;
provided, to the extent no amounts are due and owing under such loans such
amounts shall be deemed distributions with respect to the relevant ownership
interests in the Portfolio Entities making such distribution.

                     (c) If any amounts described in Sections 7.14(a) and (b)
above are paid directly to or received directly by any Portfolio Entity (other
than Borrower), such amounts shall be received only in trust for Administrative
Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such Portfolio Entities, and
Borrower shall cause such amounts to be forthwith paid over to (i) in the case
of clause (a) above, the Person to which such amounts are due and owing and (ii)
in the case of clause (b) above, Administrative Agent for application in
accordance with this Agreement, in each case in the same form as received (with
any necessary endorsement).

by the relevant Portfolio Entities, no Portfolio Entity, other than Borrower,
shall have any right, power or interest with respect to the Accounts,
Sub-Accounts and contents of Accounts and Sub-Accounts, and no such Portfolio
Entity shall hold funds in any accounts.

shall constitute an event of default ("Events of Default") hereunder:

              8.1.1  Failure to Make Payments. Borrower shall fail to pay, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (a) any principal on any Loan, or
any Reimbursement Obligation, on the date that such sum is due, (b) any interest

charge or sum due hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, within three
days after the date that such sum is due, or (c) any other fee, cost,

<PAGE>



charge or other sum due under this Agreement within five days after written

against (i) Calpine in the amount of $10,000,000 or more individually or in the
aggregate or (ii) any Portfolio Entity or any Partner in the amount of
$1,000,000 or more individually or in the aggregate (other than, in the case of
both clauses (i) and (ii) above, (a) a judgment which is fully covered by
insurance or discharged within 30 days after its entry, or (b) a judgment, the
execution of which is effectively stayed within 30 days after its entry but only
for 30 days after the date on which such stay is terminated or expires) or, in
the case of both clauses (i) and (ii) above, which if left unstayed could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower.

              8.1.3  Misstatements; Omissions. Any financial statement,
representation, warranty or certificate made or prepared by, under the control
of or on behalf of any Portfolio Entity and furnished to Administrative Agent,
the Lead Arrangers, the Technical Committee or any Bank pursuant to this
Agreement, or in any separate statement or document to be delivered to
Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder or under any other Credit Document,
shall contain an untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or shall fail
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
as of the date made, in either case, which could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower.

              8.1.4  Bankruptcy; Insolvency. Any of the Portfolio Entities, the
Partners, Calpine, any Construction Manager (so long as such Construction
Manager has outstanding or unperformed obligations under any Construction
Management Agreement), any Operator, any Project Manager, any Joint Venturer,
Power Marketer or any other purchaser of capacity or energy from a Project (so
long as Power Marketer or such other purchaser, as the case may be, has
outstanding or unperformed obligations under the Power Purchase Documents to
which it is party and such party's Bankruptcy Event could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower), any Fuel Supplier (so long as
such party's Bankruptcy Event could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Borrower) or any Turbine Purchase Contractor, Major
Contractor, Major Gas Transporter or counterparty to any electrical transmission
or interconnection agreement or material water supply agreement (so long as such
Turbine Purchase Contractor, Major Contractor, Major Gas Transporter or
counterparty has outstanding or unperformed obligations under the Turbine
Purchase Contract, Major Construction Contract, Major Gas Transportation
Agreement or other agreement to which it is a party and such party's Bankruptcy
Event could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Borrower) shall become subject to a Bankruptcy Event; provided that, solely with
respect to a Bankruptcy Event affecting any entity other than the Portfolio
Entities, the Partners and Calpine, no Event of Default shall occur as a result
of such Bankruptcy Event if the applicable Portfolio Entity obtains a
Replacement Obligor (or, in the case of the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event
with respect to a Joint Venturer, if such Portfolio Entity or another Person
acquired such Person's interest in such Project or Turbine, as the case may be)
for the affected party within 90 days thereafter and such Bankruptcy Event has
not had and does not have prior to so obtaining such Replacement Obligor (or
purchaser of the Joint Venturer's interest), a Material Adverse Effect on
Borrower.

         10.4 Defaults. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Inchoate Default, Event of Default,

unless Administrative Agent has received a notice from a Bank or Borrower,

costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at
any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent or
any such Person in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or of any such other documents; provided, however, that no Bank shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from Administrative
Agent's or any such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Administrative Agent of any such Person shall be fully justified in refusing to
take or to continue to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to
reimburse Administrative Agent and any such Person promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by
Administrative Agent or any such Person in connection with the preparation,
execution, administration or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, the Operative Documents, to the extent that
Administrative Agent or any such Person is not reimbursed for such expenses by
Borrower.

         10.6 Successor Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent acknowledges
that its current intention is to remain Administrative Agent hereunder.
Nevertheless, Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Banks and Borrower. Administrative Agent may be removed
involuntarily only for a material breach of its duties and obligations hereunder
or under the other Credit Documents or for gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder or under
the other Credit Documents and then only upon the affirmative vote of the
Required Banks (excluding Administrative Agent from such vote and Administrative
Agent's Proportionate Share of the Commitment from the amounts used to determine
the portion of the Commitment necessary to constitute the required Proportionate
Share of the remaining Banks). Upon any such resignation


                                       113

<PAGE>



or removal, the Required Banks shall have the right, with the consent of
Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to appoint a
successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Banks, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the Banks' removal of the retiring Administrative
Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, with the
consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Bank, if any Bank
shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Administrative Agent under the Operative Documents by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative
Agent only under the Credit Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Operative Documents.

         10.7 Authorization. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the
Banks to execute, deliver and perform each of the Credit Documents to which
Administrative Agent is or is intended to be a party and each Bank agrees to be
bound by all of the agreements of Administrative Agent contained in the Credit
Documents. Administrative Agent is further authorized by the Banks to release
liens on property that the Portfolio Entities permitted to sell or transfer
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents or the
Operative Documents, and to enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of curing any formal defect, inconsistency, omission or ambiguity in
this Agreement or any Credit Document to which it is a party.

         10.8 Administrative Agent, Technical Committee, Bookrunner, Lead
Arrangers, Co-Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents. With
respect to its Commitment, the Loans made by it and any Note issued to it, each
of the financial institutions acting as Administrative Agent or as members of
the Technical Committee shall have the same rights and powers under the
Operative Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it
were not Administrative Agent or a member of the Technical Committee, as the
case may be. The term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include Administrative Agent and members of the Technical Committee,
in each case in their individual capacity. The financial institutions acting as
Administrative Agent and members of the Technical Committee and their Affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any other Person,
without any duty to account therefor to the Banks. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Bookrunner, Lead Arrangers, Co-Arrangers, Syndication Agent and
the Co-Documentation Agents shall not, in such capacities (but not in their
capacities as Banks), have any rights, responsibilities, duties, obligations
(including any fiduciary obligations) or liability hereunder.

         10.9 Amendments; Waivers. Subject to the provisions of this Section
10.9, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or another Credit Document,
the Required Banks (or


                                       114

<PAGE>



Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Banks) and
Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of
adding, modifying or waiving any provisions to the Credit Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Banks or Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Inchoate Default or Event of Default; provided, however, that no such
supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of all of the Banks:

                         (i)    Modify Section 2.1.1(d), 2.1.2(d), 2.7, 2.8,
2.9, 5.1, 5.17, 6.17, 6.22, 7.1 through 7.14, 8.1.10, 10.1, 10.13, 10.14 or
10.17;

                         (ii)   Increase the amount of the Commitment of any
Bank hereunder; or

                         (iii)  Reduce the percentage specified in the
definition of Required Banks; or

                         (iv)   Permit Borrower to assign its rights under this
Agreement except as provided in Section 6.17, or permit a transfer of ownership
of a Portfolio Entity, a Project or a Turbine except as provided in Section
8.1.11, or

                         (v)    Amend this Section 10.9; or

                         (vi)   Release any Collateral from the Lien of any of
the Collateral Documents, except as permitted in Section 6.4, or allow release
of any funds from any Account otherwise than in accordance with the terms
hereof; or

                         (vii)  Extend the maturity of any Loan or any of the
Notes or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or change the
time of payment of interest due on any Loan or any Notes; or

                         (viii) Extend the Loan Maturity Date; or

                         (ix)   Reduce the amount or extend the payment date for
any amount due under Article 2, whether principal, interest, fees or other
amounts; or

                         (x)    Reduce or change the time of payment of any fee
due or payable hereunder; or

                         (xi)   Terminate the Project Completion Guaranty or the
Turbine Purchase Guaranty except in accordance with its terms; or

                         (xii)  Subordinate the Loans to any other Indebtedness.

         10.10 Withholding Tax.

               10.10.1 Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest
payment to any Bank an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If
the forms or other documentation required by Section 2.6 are not delivered to
Administrative Agent, then


                                       115

<PAGE>



Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Bank not
providing such forms or other documentation, an amount equivalent to the
applicable withholding tax.

               10.10.2 If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the
United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Administrative Agent
did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any
Bank (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed,
or because such Bank failed to notify Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by
Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff
costs, and any out of pocket expenses.

               10.10.3 If any Bank sells, assigns, grants participation in, or
otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement, the purchaser, assignee,
participant or transferee, as applicable, shall comply and be bound by the terms
of Sections 2.6.7, 10.10.1 and 10.10.2 as though it were such Bank.

         10.11 General Provisions as to Payments. Administrative Agent shall
promptly distribute to each Bank, subject to the terms of the assignment and
assumption agreement between Administrative Agent and such Bank, its pro rata
share of each payment of principal and interest payable to the Banks on the
Loans and of fees hereunder received by Administrative Agent for the account of
the Banks and of any other amounts owing under the Loans. The payments made for
the account of each Bank shall be made, and distributed to it, for the account
of (a) its domestic lending office in the case of payments of principal of, and
interest on, its Base Rate Loans, (b) its domestic or foreign lending office, as
each Bank may designate in writing to Administrative Agent, in the case of LIBOR
Loans, and (c) its domestic lending office, or such other lending office as it
may designate for the purpose from time to time, in the case of payments of fees
and other amounts payable hereunder. Banks shall have the right to alter
designated domestic lending offices upon notice to Administrative Agent and
Borrower.

         10.12 Substitution of Bank. Should any Bank fail to make a Loan in
violation of its obligations under this Agreement (a "Non-Advancing Bank"),
Administrative Agent shall (a) in its sole discretion fund the Loan on behalf of
the Non-Advancing Bank or (b) cooperate with Borrower or any other Bank to find
another Person that shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent and that shall
be willing to assume the Non-Advancing Bank's obligations under this Agreement
(including the obligation to make the Loan which the Non-Advancing Bank failed
to make but without assuming any liability for damages for failing to have made
such Loan or any previously required Loan). Subject to the provisions of the
next following sentence, such Person shall be substituted for the Non-Advancing
Bank hereunder upon execution and delivery to Administrative Agent of an
agreement acceptable to Administrative Agent by such Person assuming the
Non-Advancing Bank's obligations under this Agreement, and all interest and fees
which would otherwise have been payable to the Non-Advancing Bank shall
thereafter be payable to such Person. Nothing in (and no action taken pursuant
to) this Section 10.12 shall relieve the Non-Advancing Bank from any liability
it might have to Borrower or to the other Banks as a result of its failure to
make any Loan.


                                       116

<PAGE>



         10.13 Participation.

               10.13.1 Nothing herein provided shall prevent any Bank from
selling a participation in one or more of its Commitments (and Loans made and
Letters of Credit issued thereunder); provided that (a) no such sale of a
participation shall alter such Bank's or Borrower's obligations hereunder, (b)
any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant a participation in its rights
with respect to its Commitment (Letters of Credit and Loans) shall provide that,
with respect to such Commitment (Letters of Credit and Loans), subject to the
following proviso, such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to
exercise the rights of such Bank, and enforce the obligations of Borrower
relating to such Commitment (Letters of Credit and Loans), including the right
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Bank Document and the right to take action to have the
Notes declared due and payable pursuant to Article 8; provided, however, that
such agreement may provide that the participant may have rights to approve or
disapprove decreases in Commitments, interest rates or fees, lengthening of
maturity of any Loans, extend the payment date for any amount due under Article
2 hereof or release of any material Collateral. No recipient of a participation
in any Commitment or Loans of any Bank shall have any rights under this
Agreement or shall be entitled to any reimbursement for Taxes, Other Taxes
increased costs or reserve requirements under Sections 2.6 or 2.8 or any other
indemnity or payment rights against Borrower (but shall be permitted to receive
from the Bank granting such participation a proportionate amount which would
have been payable to the Bank from whom such Person acquired its participation).

               10.13.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding
vehicle (a "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the
Granting Bank to Administrative Agent and Borrower, the option to provide to
Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be
obligated to make to Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all
or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan
pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such
Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no
SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Bank). In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is
one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or
join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the
laws of the United States or any state thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.13, any SPC may (i) with
notice to, but without the prior written consent of, Borrower and Administrative
Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of
its interests in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any financial institutions
(consented to by Borrower and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or
credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or
maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its Loans to any rating agency,


                                       117

<PAGE>



commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or
liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This section may not be amended without the
written consent of the SPC.

         10.14 Transfer of Commitment. Notwithstanding anything else herein to
the contrary, any Bank, after receiving Borrower's prior written consent as to
the identity of the assignee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed (provided if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such
consent shall not be required), may from time to time, at its option, sell,
assign, transfer, negotiate or otherwise dispose of a portion of one or more of
its Commitments (and Loans made and Letters of Credit issued thereunder)
(including the Bank's interest in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents)
to any bank or other lending institution which in such assigning Bank's judgment
is reasonably capable of performing the obligations of a Bank hereunder and
reasonably experienced in project financing; provided, however, that no Bank
(including any assignee of any Bank) may assign any portion of its Commitment
(including Loans and Letters of Credit) of less than $10,000,000 (unless to
another Bank or in the event such assignment is an assignment of the entire
remaining Commitment of such Bank) and provided, further, that assignments of
any rights or obligations under any Letter of Credit shall require the consent
of the LC Bank; provided, further, that any Bank may assign all or any portion
of its Commitments to an Affiliate of such Bank. In the event of any such
assignment, (a) the assigning Bank's Proportionate Share shall be reduced and
its obligations hereunder released by the amount of the Proportionate Share
assigned to the new lender, (b) the parties to such assignment shall execute and
deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement evidencing such sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition substantially in the form of Exhibit L
or otherwise satisfactory to Administrative Agent together with an assignment
fee payable to Administrative Agent of $3,500 (provided such assignment fee
shall not be required with respect to the initial syndication of the Lead
Arrangers' and Co-Arrangers' Commitments) and any other related documentation
reasonably requested by Administrative Agent, including without limitation such
withholding tax certificates as may be appropriate pursuant to Section 2.6.7,
(c) at the assigning Bank's option, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
new lender new Notes in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit B in a principal
amount equal to such new lender's Commitment, and Borrower shall execute and
exchange with the assigning Bank a replacement note for any Note in an amount
equal to the Commitment retained by the Bank, if any and (d) Administrative
Agent may amend Exhibit H attached hereto to reflect the Proportionate Shares of
the Banks following such assignment. Thereafter, such new lender shall be deemed
to be a Bank and shall have all of the rights and duties of a Bank (except as
otherwise provided in this Article 10), in accordance with its Proportionate
Share, under each of the Credit Documents.

         10.15 Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article
10, no sale, assignment, transfer, negotiation or other disposition of the
interests of any Bank hereunder or under the other Credit Documents shall be
allowed if it would require registration under the federal Securities Act of
1933, as then amended, any other federal securities laws or regulations or the
securities laws or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. Borrower shall,
from time to time at the request and expense of Administrative Agent, execute
and deliver to Administrative Agent, or to such party or parties as
Administrative Agent may designate, any and all further instruments as may in
the opinion of Administrative Agent be reasonably necessary or advisable to give
full force and effect to such disposition.

         10.16 Assignability to Federal Reserve Bank. Notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document to the
contrary, any Bank may assign all or any portion of the Loans or Notes held by
it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral
security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank,
provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Loans or Notes made by
Borrower to or for the account of the assigning and/or pledging Bank in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy Borrower's obligations
hereunder in respect of such assigned Loans or Notes to the extent of such
payment. No such assignment shall release the assigning Bank from its
obligations hereunder.

         10.17 Technical Committee. Each Bank hereby appoints and authorizes
each of CIBC World Markets Corp., Credit Suisse First Boston, TD Securities
(USA) Inc. and The Bank of Nova Scotia to act as its technical committee
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (the "Technical Committee") with
such powers as are expressly delegated to the Technical Committee by the terms
of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Technical Committee shall not
have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this
Agreement or in any other Credit Document, or be a trustee or a fiduciary for
any Bank. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein the
Technical Committee shall not be required to take any action which is contrary
to this Agreement or any other Credit Documents or any Legal Requirement or
exposes the Technical Committee to any liability. All decisions and
determinations to be made by the Technical Committee hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents shall be made by unanimous consent of its members.
Borrower and each Bank hereby agrees that the protective provisions set forth in
Section 5.11 and Sections 10.1 through 10.5 shall apply to and protect, mutatis
mutandis, each member of the Technical Committee and all determinations,
decisions, actions or inactions taken or omitted to be taken by the Technical
Committee. In the event that any member of the Technical Committee at any time
reduces its Commitment to less than $10,000,000, ceases to be a Bank hereunder
or otherwise resigns from the Technical Committee, the remaining members of the
Technical Committee shall appoint a Bank as a successor member to the Technical
Committee; provided (i) such Bank shall be a Bank with one of the five largest
Commitments at such time among the Banks who are not then members of the
Technical Committee and (ii) Borrower does not reasonably disapprove of such
Bank within two Banking Days of receipt of notice of such Bank's appointment to
the Technical Committee.

         10.18 Notices to Technical Committee and Banks. Administrative Agent
promptly shall deliver all material documents, instruments and notices that it
receives hereunder and under the other Operative Documents to the Technical
Committee and to each Bank that is not a member of the Technical Committee.

                                   ARTICLE 11.
                             INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS

         11.1 Removal and Fees. Administrative Agent, in its reasonable
discretion, may remove from time to time, any one or more of the Independent
Consultants and, after consulting with Borrower as to an appropriate Person,
appoint replacements as Administrative Agent may choose. Notice of any
replacement Independent Consultant shall be given by Administrative


                                       119

<PAGE>



Agent to Borrower, the Banks and to the Independent Consultant being replaced.
All reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Consultants (whether the
original ones or replacements) shall be paid by Borrower.

         11.2 Duties. Each Independent Consultant shall be contractually
obligated to Administrative Agent to carry out the activities required of it in
this Agreement and as otherwise requested by Administrative Agent and shall be
responsible solely to Administrative Agent. Borrower acknowledges that it will
not have any cause of action or claim against any Independent Consultant
resulting from any decision made or not made, any action taken or not taken or
any advice given by such Independent Consultant in the due performance in good
faith of its duties to Administrative Agent, except to the extent arising from
such Independent Consultant's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         11.3 Independent Consultants' Certificates.

              11.3.1 Until the receipt by Administrative Agent of certificates
satisfactory to Administrative Agent from each Independent Consultant whom
Administrative Agent considers necessary or appropriate certifying Final
Completion, Borrower shall provide such documents and information to the
Independent Consultants as any of the Independent Consultants may reasonably
consider necessary in order for the Independent Consultants to deliver to
Administrative Agent the following certificates:

                     (a) all certificates to be delivered pursuant to Article 3,
if any, or, if no Loan has taken place in any month, certificates delivered at
the end of the month as to the matters required by Exhibit C-11; and

                     (b) monthly after the Closing Date, a full report and
status of the progress of each Funded Project to that date, a complete
assessment of Project Costs to Final Completion of such Projects and such other
information and certification as Administrative Agent may reasonably require
from time to time.

              11.3.2 Following Final Completion of each Project, Borrower shall
provide such documents and information to the Independent Consultants (subject
to the execution by such Independent Consultants of confidentiality agreements
reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and Borrower) as they may
reasonably consider necessary in order for the Independent Consultants to
deliver annually to Administrative Agent a certificate setting forth a full
report on the status of such Project and such other information and
certification as Administrative Agent may reasonably require from time to time.

         11.4 Certification of Dates. Administrative Agent will request that the
Independent Consultants act diligently in the issuance of all certificates
required to be delivered by the Independent Consultants hereunder, if their
issuance is appropriate. Borrower shall provide the Independent Consultants with
reasonable notice of the expected occurrence of any such dates or events.

given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be considered as properly given
(a) if delivered in person, (b) if sent by overnight delivery service (including
Federal Express, UPS, ETA, Emery, DHL, AirBorne and other similar overnight

available, if mailed by first class United States Mail, postage prepaid,
registered or certified with return receipt requested or (d) if sent by prepaid
telegram, or by telecopy or other electronic means (including electronic mail)
confirmed by telephone. Notice so given shall be effective upon receipt by the
addressee, except that communication or notice so transmitted by telecopy or
other direct electronic means shall be deemed to have been validly and
effectively given on the day (if a Banking Day and, if not, on the next
following Banking Day) on which it is transmitted if transmitted before 4:00
p.m., recipient's time, and if transmitted after that time, on the next
following Banking Day; provided, however, that if any notice is tendered to an

shall be effective upon such tender. Any party shall have the right to change
its address for notice hereunder to any other location within the continental
United States by giving of 30 days' notice to the other parties in the manner

         12.2 Additional Security; Right to Set-Off. Any deposits or other sums
at any time credited or due from Banks and any Project Revenues, securities or
other property of Borrower in the possession of Administrative Agent may at all
times be treated as collateral security for the payment of the Loans and the
Notes and all other obligations of Borrower to Banks under this Agreement and
the other Credit Documents, and Borrower hereby pledges to Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Banks and grants Administrative Agent a security interest
in and to all such deposits, sums, securities or other property. Regardless of
the adequacy of any other collateral, Administrative Agent and only
Administrative Agent, may execute or realize on the Banks' security interest in
any such deposits or other sums credited by or due from Banks to Borrower, may
apply any such deposits or other sums to or set them off against Borrower's
obligations to Banks under the Notes and this Agreement at any time after the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default.

         12.3 Delay and Waiver. No delay or omission to exercise any right,
power or remedy accruing to the Banks upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default or Inchoate Default or any breach or default of the Portfolio Entities
under this Agreement or any other Credit Document


                                       122

<PAGE>



shall impair any such right, power or remedy of the Banks, nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring, nor
shall any waiver of any single Event of Default, Inchoate Default or other
breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other Event of Default, Inchoate
Default or other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any
waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of
Administrative Agent and/or the Banks of any Event of Default, Inchoate Default
or other breach or default under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or
any waiver on the part of Administrative Agent and/or the Banks of any provision
or condition of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, must be in writing
and shall be effective only to the extent in such writing specifically set
forth. All remedies, either under this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
by law or otherwise afforded to Administrative Agent, LC Bank and the Banks,
shall be cumulative and not alternative.

         12.4 Costs, Expenses and Attorneys' Fees; Syndication.

              12.4.1 Borrower will pay to Administrative Agent, Lead Arrangers,
Co-Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents all of its
reasonable costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
closing and administering this Agreement and the documents contemplated hereby
and any participation or syndication of the Loans or this Agreement, including
the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of Latham & Watkins and other
associated local attorneys retained by such Persons in connection with the
preparation of such documents and any amendments hereof or thereof, or the
preparation, negotiation, closing, administration, enforcement, participation or
syndication of the Loans or this Agreement, the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of the Independent Consultants and any other engineering,
insurance and construction consultants to Administrative Agent, Lead Arrangers,
Co-Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the Loans subsequent to the Closing Date, and
the travel and out-of-pocket costs incurred by such Persons following the
Closing Date, and Borrower further agrees to pay Administrative Agent, Lead
Arrangers, Co-Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents the
out-of-pocket costs and travel costs incurred by such Persons in connection with
syndication of the Loans or this Agreement; provided, however, Borrower shall
not be required to pay advertising costs of any of the Banks or the fees of the
Banks' attorneys, other than Latham & Watkins and associated local counsel or
the fees and costs of any engineers or consultants other than the Independent
Engineer and the Independent Consultant engaged by Administrative Agent.
Borrower will reimburse Administrative Agent, Lead Arrangers, Co-Arrangers,
Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents for all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, expended or incurred by such Persons in
enforcing this Agreement or the other Credit Documents in connection with an
Event of Default or Inchoate Default, in actions for declaratory relief in any
way related to this Agreement or in collecting any sum which becomes due such

Information Memorandum and all updates or supplements thereto, upon terms
acceptable to such Persons.

         12.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and any agreement, document or
instrument attached hereto or referred to herein integrate all the terms and
conditions mentioned herein or incidental hereto and supersede all oral
negotiations and prior writings in respect to the subject matter hereof. In the
event of any conflict between the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement and any such agreement, document or instrument, the terms, conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall prevail. This Agreement and the other
Credit Documents may only be amended or modified by an instrument in writing
signed by Borrower, Administrative Agent and any other parties to such
agreements.

         12.6 Governing Law. This Agreement, and any instrument or agreement
required hereunder (to the extent not otherwise expressly provided for therein),
shall be governed by, and construed under, the laws of the State of New York,
without reference to conflicts of laws (other than Section 5-1401 of the New
York General Obligations Law).

         12.7 Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

         12.8 Headings. Paragraph headings have been inserted in this Agreement
as a matter of convenience for reference only and it is agreed that such
paragraph headings are not a part of this Agreement and shall not be used in the
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

         12.9 Accounting Terms. All accounting terms not specifically defined
herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP and practices consistent with
those applied in the preparation of the financial statements submitted by
Borrower to Administrative Agent, and all financial data submitted pursuant to
this Agreement shall be prepared in accordance with such principles and
practices.

         12.10 Additional Financing. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
Banks have made no agreement or commitment to provide any financing except as
set forth herein.

         12.11 No Partnership, Etc. The Banks and Borrower intend that the
relationship between them shall be solely that of creditor and debtor. Nothing
contained in this Agreement, the Notes or in any of the other Credit Documents
shall be deemed or construed to create a partnership, tenancy-in-common, joint
tenancy, joint venture or co-ownership by or between the Banks, Borrower or any
other Person. The Banks shall not be in any way responsible or liable for the
debts, losses, obligations or duties of the Portfolio Entities or any other
Person with respect to any Project, Turbine or otherwise. All obligations to pay
real property or other taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and all other
fees and charges arising from the ownership, operation or occupancy of any
Project or Turbine and to perform all obligations and other agreements and
contracts relating to any Project or Turbine shall be the sole responsibility of
the Portfolio Entities.

         12.12 Deed of Trust/Collateral Documents. The Loans are or will be
secured in part by the Deeds of Trust encumbering certain properties associated
with the Projects in such Projects'


                                       124

respective states. Reference is hereby made to the Deeds of Trust and the other
Collateral Documents for the provisions, among others, relating to the nature
and extent of the security provided thereunder, the rights, duties and
obligations of the Portfolio Entities and the rights of Administrative Agent and
the Banks with respect to such security.

         12.13 Limitation on Liability. No claim shall be made by any Portfolio
Entity, either Partner, Calpine or any of their Affiliates, against the Banks or
any of their Affiliates, directors, employees, attorneys or agents for any
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any breach or
wrongful conduct (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort
or duty imposed by law), in connection with, arising out of or in any way
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Operative Documents or any act or omission or event occurring in connection
therewith except to the extent that any such claims are caused by the willful
misconduct of the Banks; and Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to
sue upon any such claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether
or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

         12.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE BANKS AND BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY, AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OR
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN), OR ACTIONS
OF THE BANKS OR BORROWER. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE BANKS
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

         12.15 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Banks and Borrower agree that any
legal action or proceeding by or against Borrower or with respect to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Notes, or any other Credit Document may be brought in
or removed to the courts of the State of New York, in and for the County of New
York, or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York,
as Administrative Agent may elect. By execution and delivery of the Agreement,
the Banks and Borrower accept, for themselves and in respect of their property,
generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The
Banks and Borrower irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of
the aforementioned courts in any manner permitted by law. Nothing herein shall
affect the right of Administrative Agent to bring legal action or proceedings in
any other competent jurisdiction, including judicial or non-judicial foreclosure
of the Deed of Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, service of process shall
not be deemed served or mailed to Administrative Agent or the Banks until a copy
of all matters to be served have be mailed to Latham & Watkins, 701 B Street,
Suite 2100, San Diego, California 92101, Attn: Andrew Singer or such other
Person as Administrative Agent or the Banks may hereafter designate by notice
given pursuant to Section 12.1. The Banks and Borrower further agree that the
aforesaid courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America
shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any claim or counterclaim of
Borrower based upon the assertion that the rate of interest charged by the Banks
on or under this Agreement, the Loans and/or the other Credit Documents is
usurious. The Banks and Borrower hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any
action or proceeding under or in connection with any or all of any Project,
Turbine, this Agreement or any other Credit Document brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of forum non-conveniens.


                                       125

         12.16 Usury. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Notes shall be
deemed to require the payment of interest or other charges by Borrower or any
other Person in excess of the amount which the holders of the Notes may lawfully
charge under any applicable usury laws. In the event that the holders of the
Notes shall collect moneys which are deemed to constitute interest which would
increase the effective interest rate to a rate in excess of that permitted to be
charged by applicable law, all such sums deemed to constitute interest in excess
of the legal rate shall, upon such determination, at the option of the holder of
the Notes, be returned to Borrower or credited against the principal balance of
the Notes then outstanding.

         12.17 Knowledge and Attribution. References in this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents to the "knowledge," "best knowledge" or facts and
circumstances "known to" Borrower, and all like references, mean facts or
circumstances of which a Responsible Officer of a Portfolio Entity or a Partner
has actual knowledge after due inquiry.

         12.18 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights under this Agreement except as provided in Section 6.17, and the Banks
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights under this Agreement
except as provided in Article 10.

         12.19 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
duplicate counterparts and when signed by all of the parties listed below shall
constitute a single binding agreement.

         12.20 Amendment and Restatement. This Agreement amends and restates the
Original Credit Agreement in its entirety and all loans, letters of credit,
liens or other obligations outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement shall
continue as Loans, Letters of Credit, Liens and Obligations outstanding
hereunder. Neither the foregoing nor Section 12.5 hereof withstanding, (i) any
breach or default under the representations and warranties contained in the
Original Credit Agreement, to the extent such representations and warranties
were made by Borrower prior to the Effective Date, shall (to the extent not
cured or otherwise waived in writing by Administrative Agent) survive and be
effective until the Obligations are paid and performed in full and (ii) any
other breaches or defaults under the Original Credit Agreement occurring prior
to the Effective Date (to the extent not cured or otherwise waived in writing by
the Administrative Agent) shall continue as a breach or default hereunder. If
the context requires, references to agreements, documents, instruments or other
deliverables in respect to the Initial Projects or the Lost Pines Project shall
be deemed references to such agreements, documents, instruments or other
deliverables as provided to Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers and/or the
Technical Committee, as applicable, pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement.

                  generally accepted consulting practices consisting of a
                  walk-through of such Site conducted on ____________, _____,
                  observation of installed equipment and material, observation
                  of work procedures, review of "QA" and "QC" reports as made
                  available by the Contractors with respect to the Project and
                  attendance of the construction monthly progress review meeting
                  with respect to the Project. We have reviewed paragraphs 4.1
                  through 4.7, 4.9, 4.11 through 4.13 and 4.15 of the
                  Construction Drawdown Certificate with respect to the Project
                  (the "Current Construction Drawdown Certificate"), dated
                  ________________ (the "Drawdown Date"), and we have previously
                  reviewed the corresponding paragraphs of all previous
                  Construction Drawdown Certificates with respect to the
                  Project. We have also reviewed the materials attached to the
                  Current Construction Drawdown Certificate as Attachment A,
                  including each monthly progress report submitted pursuant to
                  each Construction Contract with respect to the Project (the
                  "Current Contractor Certificates"), and we have reviewed the
                  contractor certificates submitted with all previous
                  Construction Drawdown Certificates with respect to the
                  Project. We have also reviewed the following additional
                  material:__.

         4.       To the extent practical, we have periodically reviewed the
                  progress of engineering, procurement and construction for the
                  Project and in the course of this review we have not
                  discovered any errors or omissions in the claims for materials
                  that have been procured and work performed under this and all
                  previous Borrowings.

         5.       Based on our review of the aforementioned information, and of

                        Appointment of Depositary Agent;
                            Establishment of Accounts

            Section 2.1 Appointment of Depositary Agent. Depositary Agent is
hereby appointed by Borrower and by Administrative Agent as depositary agent
hereunder, and Depositary Agent hereby agrees to act as such and to accept all
cash, payments, other amounts and Permitted Investments to be delivered to or
held by Depositary Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Depositary
Agent shall hold and safeguard the Accounts (and the cash, instruments and
securities on deposit therein) during the term of this Agreement and shall treat
the cash, instruments, and securities in the Accounts as funds, instruments and
securities pledged by Borrower to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit
of the Banks, to be held by Depositary Agent, as agent of Administrative Agent,
in trust in accordance with the provisions hereof.

            Section 2.2 Security Interest; Control. In order to secure the
performance by Borrower of all of its covenants, agreements and obligations
under the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the payment and
performance by Borrower of all Obligations, this Agreement is intended to

Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, a security interest in and to, the
Accounts, all cash, cash equivalents, instruments, investments and other
securities at any time on deposit in the Accounts, and all proceeds of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the "Collateral"). All moneys, cash equivalents,
instruments, investments and securities at any time on deposit in any of the
Accounts shall constitute collateral security for the payment and performance by
Borrower of the Obligations, and shall at all times be subject to the control of
Administrative Agent, acting through Depositary Agent in respect of the Accounts
and shall be held in the custody of Depositary Agent in trust for the purposes
of, and on the terms set forth in, this Agreement.

            Section 2.3 Accounts Maintained as UCC "Securities Accounts."
Depositary Agent hereby agrees and confirms that it has established the Accounts
as set forth and defined in this Agreement. Each of Depositary Agent and
Borrower agrees that (i) Depositary Agent is acting as "securities intermediary"
(within the meaning of Section 8-102(14) of the UCC) with respect to the
Accounts and the "financial assets" (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9)
of the UCC, the "Financial Assets") credited to the Accounts; (ii) each such
Account established by Depositary Agent is and will be maintained as a
"securities account" (within the meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC); (iii)
Borrower is an "entitlement holder" (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(7)
of the UCC) in respect of the Financial Assets credited to such Accounts and
with respect to such Accounts and Depositary Agent shall so note in its records
pertaining to


                                        3

<PAGE>



such Financial Assets and Accounts; and (iv) all Financial Assets in registered
form or payable to or to order of and credited to any such Account shall be
registered in the name of, payable to or to the order of, or specially endorsed
to, Depositary Agent or in blank, or credited to another securities account
maintained in the name of Depositary Agent, and in no case will any Financial
Asset credited to any such Account be registered in the name of, payable to or
to the order of, or endorsed to, Borrower except to the extent the foregoing
have been subsequently endorsed by Borrower to Depositary Agent or in blank.
Each item of property (including a security, security entitlement, investment
property, instrument or obligation, share, participation, interest or other
property whatsoever) credited to any Account shall be treated as a Financial
Asset. Until this Agreement shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof,
Administrative Agent shall have "control" (within the meaning of Section
8-106(d)(2) of the UCC) of Borrower's "security entitlements" (within the
meaning of Section 8-102(a)(17) of the UCC, "Security Entitlements") with
respect to the Accounts and the Financial Assets credited to the Accounts. All
property delivered to Depositary Agent pursuant to this Agreement will be
promptly credited to the Accounts and shall be treated as Financial Assets. If
at any time Depositary Agent shall receive from Administrative Agent any
"entitlement order" (within the meaning of Section 8-102(8) of the UCC, an
"Entitlement Order") relating to the Accounts or Financial Assets credited to
the Accounts, Depositary Agent shall comply with such Entitlement Order without
further consent by Borrower or any other Person. In the event that Depositary
Agent receives conflicting Entitlement Orders relating to the Accounts or
Financial Assets credited to the Accounts from Administrative Agent and any
other Person (including, without limitation, Borrower), Depositary Agent shall
comply with the Entitlement Orders originated by Administrative Agent. Each of
Borrower and Depositary Agent agrees that it has not and will not execute and
deliver, or otherwise become bound by, any agreement under which it agrees with
any Person other than Administrative Agent to comply with Entitlement Orders
originated by such Person relating to the Accounts or Financial Assets credited
to the Accounts. Except for the claims and interests of Administrative Agent and
Borrower in the Accounts and the Financial Assets credited to the Accounts,
neither Depositary Agent nor Borrower knows of any claim to, or interest in, any
Account or Financial Assets credited to the Accounts. If either Depositary Agent
or Borrower obtains knowledge that any Person has asserted a lien, encumbrance
or adverse claim against any or the Accounts or Financial Assets credited to the
Accounts, such party will promptly notify Administrative Agent thereof. In the
event that the Depositary Agent has or subsequently obtains by agreement,
operation of law or otherwise a Lien or security interest in any Account, any
Security Entitlement carried therein or credited thereto or any Financial Asset
that is the subject of any such Security Entitlement, Depositary Agent agrees
that such Lien or security interest shall be subordinate to the Lien and
security interest of the Administrative Agent. The Financial Assets standing to
the credit of the Accounts will not be subject to deduction, set-off, banker's
lien or any other right, and Depositary Agent shall not grant, permit or consent
to any other right or interest in such Financial Assets, in favor of any Person
(including the Depositary Agent) other than Administrative Agent.

            Section 2.4 Borrower's Rights. Borrower shall not have any rights or
powers with respect to any amounts in the Accounts or any part thereof except
(i) as provided in Article 5 hereof and (ii) the right to have such amounts
applied in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Credit Agreement.

money held in any Account in such Permitted Investments as directed in writing
by Borrower from time to time (or, if Administrative Agent shall have notified
Depositary Agent that Administrative Agent is exercising its power of attorney

Depositary Agent shall be under no obligation to invest any such money. Any

                  (f)   Depositary Agent may execute or perform any duties under
this Agreement either directly or through agents or attorneys;

obligations of such Persons as freely as if it were not Depositary Agent
hereunder; and

                  (h) Depositary Agent shall not be obligated to take any action
which in its reasonable judgment would involve it in expense or liability unless
it has been furnished with reasonable indemnity.

            Section 6.2 Resignation or Removal.

                  (a) Depositary Agent may at any time resign by giving notice

                                    ARTICLE 7

                                 Determinations

            Section 7.1 Sales of Permitted Investments. Depositary Agent will
use its best efforts to sell Permitted Investments so that actual money is
available, on each date on which a distribution is to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, for Depositary Agent to make such distribution in money on such date.

            Section 7.2 Available Cash. In determining the amount of deposit or
available money in any Account at any time, in addition to any money then on
deposit in such Account, Depositary Agent shall treat as on deposit or as
available money the net amount which, in the reasonable opinion of Depositary
Agent, would have been received by Depositary Agent on such day if Depositary
Agent had liquidated all the Permitted Investments (at then prevailing market
prices) then on deposit in such Account.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                                  Miscellaneous

indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless Depositary Agent, Administrative
Agent, each Bank and their respective successors, assigns, agents and servants
from and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, all reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel to Depositary Agent, Administrative Agent or any
Bank, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, at any time,
Depositary Agent, Administrative Agent or any Bank, and in any way relating to
or arising out of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
establishment of the Accounts, the acceptance of deposits, the purchase or sale
of Permitted Investments, the retention of money and Permitted Investments or
the proceeds thereof and any payment, transfer or other application of money or
Permitted Investments by Depositary Agent, Administrative Agent or any Bank in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of
any act, omission or error of Depositary Agent made in good faith in the conduct
of its duties. Borrower shall not, however, be required to indemnify, protect,
save and keep harmless Depositary Agent, Administrative Agent or any Bank
against its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The indemnities
contained in this Section 8.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
All payments made by Borrower hereunder shall be made without setoff or
counterclaim.

with respect to all of its existing and future claims against Borrower or any

this Agreement shall terminate on the date on which all Obligations shall have
been paid in full and the Credit Documents have terminated in accordance with
their terms. The termination of this Agreement shall have been deemed to have
occurred upon receipt by Depositary Agent of a certificate to such effect
executed by Administrative Agent. Promptly after receipt of such certificate by
Depositary Agent, Depositary Agent shall distribute all amounts contained in the
Accounts to the Borrower and shall be discharged of all obligations hereunder.

            Section 8.4 Severability. If any one or more of the covenants or
agreements provided in this Agreement on the part of the parties to this
Agreement to be performed should be determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such covenant or agreement shall be deemed
and construed to be severable from the remaining covenants and agreements of
this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining
provisions.

            Section 8.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

without the prior written consent of each of the parties to this Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth
above and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and as an inducement to Project Owner to enter
into the Relevant Documents with the Affiliated Parties, Guarantor hereby
consents and agrees as follows:

         1. Guaranty.

                  (a) The undersigned Guarantor, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Project Owner
payment and performance when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of any
and all obligations and liabilities of each of the Affiliated Parties under the
Relevant Documents, together with all expenses incurred by Project Owner in
enforcing any of such obligations and liabilities or the terms hereof,
including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel
(collectively, the "Obligations"), and agrees that if for any reason any of the
Affiliated Parties shall fail to pay or perform when due any of such
Obligations, Guarantor will pay or perform the same forthwith (it being
understood that Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be subject to the same
limitations of liability as the Affiliated Parties' liability under the Relevant
Documents). Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and of any
obligation to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof, and waives
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, notice of dishonor or non-payment,
protest, notice of protest, of any such obligations, suit or taking other action
by Project Owner against, and giving any notice of default or other notice to,
or making any demand on, any party liable thereon (including Guarantor).

                  (b) This Guaranty is a primary obligation of the Guarantor and
is an absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty of payment
and performance and not of collectibility and is in no way conditioned on or
contingent upon any attempt to enforce in whole or in part any of the Affiliated
Parties' liabilities and obligations to Project Owner. If any of the Affiliated
Parties shall fail to pay or perform any of the Obligations to Project Owner as
and when they are due, Guarantor shall forthwith pay or perform, as applicable,
such Obligations. Any and all payments by Guarantor hereunder shall be in
immediately available funds. Each failure by any of the Affiliated Parties to
pay or perform any Obligations shall give rise to a separate cause of action
herewith, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action
arises.

                  (c) Project Owner may, at any time and from time to time
(whether or not after revocation or termination of this Guaranty) without the
consent of or notice to Guarantor, except such notice as may be required by the
Relevant Documents or applicable law

                                        2

which cannot be waived, without incurring responsibility to Guarantor, without
impairing or releasing the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, upon or without
any terms or conditions and in whole or in part, (i) change the manner, place
and terms of payment or performance or change or extend the time of payment of,
renew, or alter any Obligation, or any obligations and liabilities (including
any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or
hereof or in any manner modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Relevant
Documents, any documents, instruments or agreements executed in connection
therewith, in each case with the consent of the relevant Affiliated Parties, if
required by the Relevant Documents, and the guaranty herein made shall apply to
the Obligations, changed, extended, renewed, modified, amended, supplemented or
altered in any manner; (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against any of the Affiliated Parties or others (including Guarantor) or
otherwise act or refrain from acting; (iii) add or release any other guarantor
from its obligations without affecting or impairing the obligations of Guarantor
hereunder; (iv) settle or compromise any Obligations and/or any obligations and
liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly
in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part
thereof to the payment of any obligations and liabilities which may be due to
Project Owner or others; (v) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or
otherwise deal with in any manner or in any order any property by whomsoever
pledged or mortgaged to secure or howsoever securing the Obligations or any
liabilities or obligations (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly
or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof and/or any offset thereagainst; (vi)
apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligations and
liabilities of any of the Affiliated Parties to Project Owner under the Relevant
Documents in the manner provided therein regardless of what obligations and
liabilities remain unpaid; (vii) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act,
omission or default under, the Relevant Documents or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement (with the consent of the relevant Affiliated Parties, if required by
the Relevant Documents) the Relevant Documents or any of such other instruments
or agreements; and/or (viii) act or fail to act in any manner referred to in
this Guaranty which may deprive Guarantor of its right to subrogation against
any of the Affiliated Parties to recover full indemnity for any payments made
pursuant to this Guaranty or of its right of contribution against any other
party.

                  (d) No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the
obligations or liabilities hereby guaranteed shall affect, impair, or be a
defense to this Guaranty, which is a primary obligation of Guarantor.

                  (e) This is a continuing Guaranty and all obligations to which
it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. In the event that, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 1(a) hereof, this Guaranty shall be deemed revocable in
accordance with applicable law, then any such revocation shall become effective
only upon receipt by Project Owner of written notice of revocation signed by
Guarantor. No revocation or termination hereof shall affect in any manner rights
arising under this Guaranty with respect to Obligations (i) arising prior to
receipt by Project Owner of written notice of such revocation or termination and
the sole effect of revocation and termination hereof shall be to exclude from
this Guaranty Obligations thereafter arising which are unconnected with
Obligations theretofore arising or transactions theretofore entered into or

                                        3

<PAGE>



(ii) arising as a result of a default under the Relevant Documents occurring by
reason of the revocation or termination of this Guaranty.

                  (f) (i) Except as otherwise required by law, each payment
required to be made by Guarantor to Project Owner hereunder shall be made
without deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxes. If such deduction
or withholding is so required, Guarantor shall, upon notice thereof from Project
Owner, (A) pay the amount required to be deducted or withheld to the appropriate
authorities before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon, (B) on
or before the 60th day after payment of such amount, forward to Project Owner an
official receipt evidencing such payment (or a certified copy thereof), and (C)
in the case of any such deduction or withholding, forthwith pay to Project Owner
such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
actually received by Project Owner is free and clear of such Taxes, including
any Taxes on such additional amount, is equal to the amount that Project Owner
would have received had there been no such deduction or withholding.

                      (ii) As used herein, the term "Tax" means any present or
future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any nature
(including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by any
government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under this
Guaranty other than any income, franchise or similar tax imposed upon the gross
or net income of Project Owner by the United States or any State or any
jurisdiction where Project Owner is organized and/or the jurisdiction in which
is located.

         2. Representations and Warranties. Guarantor makes the representations
and warranties set forth below to Project Owner as of the date hereof:

                  (a) Guarantor is duly formed, validly existing and in good

or any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to or binding
on Guarantor or any of its Affiliates or properties; (ii) do not and will not

not already been obtained.

                  (f) There is no pending or, to the best of Guarantor's
knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting Guarantor before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator, which might reasonably be expected to

obligations under this Guaranty.

                  (g) Guarantor possesses all franchises, certificates,

under this Guaranty.

                  (h) Guarantor is not an investment company or a company

                      (i) Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining
financial and other information pertaining to the businesses, operations and
condition (financial and otherwise) of each of the Affiliated Parties and their
respective properties on a continuing basis, and Guarantor now is and hereafter

(financial and otherwise) of each of the Affiliated Parties and their respective
properties.

                  (j) (i) Guarantor is not, and will not as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty, be rendered insolvent, (ii) Guarantor
does not intend to incur, or believe it is incurring, obligations beyond its

performance of this Guaranty will not constitute unreasonably small capital.

         3. Covenants. So long as any Obligations are outstanding, Guarantor
agrees that:

                  (a) It will maintain in full force and effect all consents of

respect to this Guaranty and will obtain any that may become necessary in the
future;

                  (b) It will comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply
would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this
Guaranty;

                                        5

<PAGE>



                  (c) Promptly, and in any event within 30 Banking Days after
the General Counsel of Guarantor obtains knowledge thereof, Guarantor will give
to Project Owner notice of the occurrence of any event or of any litigation or
governmental proceeding pending (i) against Guarantor or any of its Affiliates
which could affect the business, operations, property, assets or condition
(financial or otherwise) of Guarantor so as to materially and adversely affect
the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder or (ii) with
respect to this Guaranty, which event or pending proceeding is likely to
materially and adversely affect the business, operations, property, assets or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor and its Affiliates taken as a
whole;

                  (d) It will deliver such other documents and other information
reasonably requested by Project Owner; and

                  (e) It will comply in all material respects with its
certificate of incorporation.

         4. Waiver. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and
remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to
assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including without
limitation (a) any right to require Project Owner to proceed against any of the
Affiliated Parties or any other person or to proceed against or exhaust any
security held by Project Owner at any time or to pursue any other remedy in
Project Owner's power before proceeding against Guarantor, (b) any defense that
may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of power or authority, death,
dissolution, merger, termination or disability of any of the Affiliated Parties
or any other Person or the failure of Project Owner to file or enforce a claim
against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of
any of the Affiliated Parties or any other Person, (c) demand, presentment,
protest and notice of any kind, including without limitation notice of the
existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or
obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of any of the Affiliated
Parties, Project Owner, any endorser or creditor of any of the Affiliated
Parties or Guarantor or on the part of any other person under this or any other
instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by
Project Owner as collateral or in connection with any Obligations, (d) any
defense based upon an election of remedies by Project Owner, including without
limitation an election to proceed by non-judicial rather than judicial
foreclosure, which destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of
Guarantor, the right of Guarantor to proceed against any of the Affiliated
Parties for reimbursement, or both, (e) any defense based on any offset against
any amounts which may be owed by any Person to Guarantor for any reason
whatsoever, (f) any defense based on any act, failure to act, delay or omission
whatsoever on the part of any of the Affiliated Parties or the failure by any of
the Affiliated Parties to do any act or thing or to observe or perform any
covenant, condition or agreement to be observed or performed by it under the
Relevant Documents, (g) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which
provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in
other respects more burdensome than that of the principal provided, that, upon
payment in full of the Obligations, this Guaranty shall no longer be of any
force or effect, (h) any defense, setoff or counterclaim which may at any time
be available to or asserted by any of the

                                        6

<PAGE>



Affiliated Parties against Project Owner or any other Person under the Relevant
Documents, (i) any duty on the part of Project Owner to disclose to Guarantor
any facts Project Owner may now or hereafter know about any of the Affiliated
Parties, regardless of whether Project Owner have reason to believe that any
such facts materially increase the risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to
assume, or have reason to believe that such facts are unknown to Guarantor, or
have a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Guarantor, since
Guarantor acknowledges that Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of any of the Affiliated Parties and of all
circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment of any obligations and
liabilities hereby guaranteed, (j) the fact that Guarantor may at any time in
the future dispose of all or part of its direct or indirect interest in any of
the Affiliated Parties, (k) any defense based on any change in the time, manner
or place of any payment under, or in any other term of, the Relevant Documents
or any other amendment, renewal, extension, acceleration, compromise or waiver
of or any consent or departure from the terms of the Relevant Documents, (l) any
defense arising because of Project Owner's election, in any proceeding
instituted under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section
1111(b)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, and (m) any defense based upon any
borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code.

                  5. Subordination. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Guaranty, all existing and future indebtedness of any of the Affiliated
Parties to Guarantor (except to the extent such indebtedness is incurred in the
ordinary course of business and relates to costs of materials or services
provided pursuant to or consistent with the Relevant Documents) and the right of
Guarantor to withdraw any capital invested by Guarantor in any of the Affiliated
Parties, is hereby subordinated to all obligations and liabilities hereby
guaranteed. Without the prior written consent of Project Owner or Administrative
Agent, such subordinated indebtedness shall not be paid or withdrawn in whole or
in part, nor shall Guarantor accept any payment of or on account of any such
indebtedness or as a withdrawal of capital while this Guaranty is in effect. Any
payment by any of the Affiliated Parties in violation of this Guaranty shall be
received by Guarantor in trust for Project Owner, and Guarantor shall cause the
same to be paid to Project Owner immediately upon demand by Project Owner on
account of the relevant Affiliated Parties' obligations and liabilities hereby
guaranteed. Guarantor shall not assign all or any portion of such indebtedness
while this Guaranty remains in effect except upon prior written notice to
Project Owner by which the assignee of any such indebtedness agrees that the
assignment is made subject to the terms of this Guaranty, and that any attempted
assignment of such indebtedness in violation of the provisions hereof shall be
void.

                  6. Subrogation. Until the Obligations have been paid in full,
(a) Guarantor shall not have any right of subrogation and waives all rights to
enforce any remedy which Project Owner now have or may hereafter have against
any of the Affiliated Parties, and waives the benefit of, and all rights to
participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Project Owner from any of
the Affiliated Parties and (b) Guarantor waives any claim, right or remedy which
Guarantor now has or hereafter acquires against any of the Affiliated Parties
that arises hereunder and/or from the performance by the Guarantor hereunder
including, without limitation, any claim, remedy or right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, or participation in
any claim, right or remedy of Project Owner against any of

                                        7

<PAGE>



the Affiliated Parties, or any security which Project Owner now have or
hereafter acquire, whether or not such claim, right or remedy arises in equity,
under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise.

         7. Bankruptcy.

                  (a) So long as any of the Obligations are owed to Project
Owner, Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Project Owner,
commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, or insolvency proceeding against any of the Affiliated Parties.
The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered, limited
or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement
of any of the Affiliated Parties, or by any defense which any of the Affiliated
Parties may have by reason of any order, decree or decision of any court or
administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

                  (b) So long as any Obligations are owed to Project Owner, to
the extent of such Obligations, Guarantor shall file, in any bankruptcy or other
proceeding in which the filing of claims is required or permitted by law, all
claims which Guarantor may have against any of the Affiliated Parties relating
to any indebtedness of any of the Affiliated Parties to Guarantor, and hereby
assigns to Project Owner all rights of Guarantor thereunder. If Guarantor does
not file any such claim, Project Owner, is hereby authorized to do so in the
name of Guarantor or, in Project Owner's discretion, to assign the claim to a
nominee and to cause proofs of claim to be filed in the name of Project Owner's
nominee. The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and cannot
be revoked. Project Owner or its nominee shall have the sole right to accept or
reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any other action
which a party filing a claim is entitled to take. In all such cases, whether in
administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person authorized to pay such a
claim shall pay the same to Project Owner to the extent of any Obligations which
then remain unpaid, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose,
Guarantor hereby assigns to Project Owner all of Guarantor's rights to all such
payments or distributions to which Guarantor would otherwise be entitled;
provided, however, that Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not be satisfied
except to the extent that Project Owner receives cash by reason of any such
payment or distribution. If Project Owner receives anything hereunder other than
cash, the same shall be held as collateral for amounts due under this Guaranty.

         8. Successions or Assignments.

                  (a) This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the successors
or assigns of Project Owner who shall have, to the extent of its interest, the
rights of Project Owner hereunder.

                  (b) This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor and its successors
and assigns. Guarantor is not entitled to assign its obligations hereunder to
any other person without

                                        8

<PAGE>



the written consent of Project Owner and Administrative Agent, and any purported
assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

         9. Waivers.

                  (a) No delay on the part of Project Owner in exercising any of
their rights (including those hereunder) and no partial or single exercise
thereof and no action or non-action by Project Owner, with or without notice to
Guarantor or anyone else, shall constitute a waiver of any rights or shall
affect or impair this Guaranty.

                  (b) GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY OR RELATING
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS GUARANTY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUARANTOR
AND PROJECT OWNER THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS
WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT
PROJECT OWNER HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS GUARANTY,
AND THAT PROJECT OWNER WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED
FUTURE DEALINGS. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED
THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

         10. Interpretation. The section headings in this Guaranty are for the
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or construction
of any provision hereof.

         11. Notices. All notices in connection with this Guaranty shall be
given by telex or cable or by notice in writing hand-delivered or sent by
facsimile transmission or by certified mail return-receipt requested (airmail,
if overseas), postage prepaid. All such notices shall be sent to the appropriate
telex or telecopier number or address, as the case may be, set forth in Section
15 below or to such other number or address as shall have been subsequently
specified by written notice to the other party, and shall be sent with copies,
if any, as indicated below. All such notices shall be effective upon receipt,
and confirmation by answerback of any such notice so sent by telex shall be
sufficient evidence of receipt thereof.

         12. Amendments. This Guaranty may be amended only with the written
consent of the parties hereto.

         13. Jurisdiction; Governing Law.

                  (a) Any action or proceeding relating in any way to this
Guaranty may be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or
of the United States for the Southern District of New York. Any such process or
summons in connection with any such

                                        9

<PAGE>



action or proceeding may be served by mailing a copy thereof by certified or
registered mail, or any substantially similar form of mail, addressed to
Guarantor as provided for notices hereunder.

                  (b) This Guaranty and the rights and obligations of Project
Owner and of the Guarantor shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the law of the State of New York without reference to principles of conflicts of
laws (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law).

<PAGE>



                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth
above and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and as an inducement to Administrative Agent and
the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement with Borrower, Guarantor hereby
consents and agrees as follows:

         1. Guaranty.

                  (a) The undersigned Guarantor, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Banks (i)
the performance, when due, of the obligations of Borrower under Section 5.14 of
the Credit Agreement to achieve Completion of each of the Funded Projects
(including with respect to any partially owned Projects), (ii) the payment, when
due, of the obligations of Borrower under Section 5.17.1, 5.17.2 and 5.17.3(x)
of the Credit Agreement and (iii) if Borrower is unable to obtain a disbursement
of Loan proceeds under the Credit Agreement for any Project for which the
requirements of Section 5.14 of the Credit Agreement have not been waived in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement for a period of 60 consecutive
days after a request for the same pursuant to a Construction Drawdown
Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Credit Agreement, the
prompt payment, when due, of the Project Costs for which funds were requested in
such Construction Drawdown Certificate, in each case together with the payment
of all expenses incurred by Administrative Agent or the Banks in enforcing any
of such obligations and liabilities or the terms hereof, including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel (collectively, the
"Obligations"), and agrees that if for any reason Borrower shall fail to pay or
perform, as the case may be, when due any of such Obligations, Guarantor will
pay or perform, as the case may be, the same forthwith; provided, however, if
the default giving rise to the potential exercise of remedies is susceptible of
cure and the failure to so exercise remedies could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Banks
shall not exercise any remedies in the nature of foreclosure on or sale of any
Collateral, appointment of a receiver, entry into possession of any Project or
other remedies under the Credit Documents intended to or having the effect of
depriving Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity of the use, possession or
enjoyment of any of the Projects as a result of an Event of Default thereunder
for 90 days so long as Guarantor is diligently pursuing performance of the
Obligations and/or diligently attempting to refinance all outstanding Loans
under the Credit Agreement; provided, further, that if the Obligations under
clause (ii) above have been performed, Guarantor's liability with respect to the
Obligations under clause (i) above shall be limited to the excess of the cost of
achieving Completion of the applicable Projects over the amounts deposited or
contributed pursuant to Section 5.17.3 of the Credit Agreement. Guarantor waives
notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and of any obligation to which it applies
or may apply under the terms hereof, and waives diligence, presentment, demand
of payment or performance, notice of dishonor or non-payment or non-performance,
protest, notice of protest, of any such obligations, suit or taking other action
by the Banks against, and giving any notice of default or other notice to, or
making any demand on, any party liable thereon (including Guarantor).

                  (b) This Guaranty is a primary obligation of Guarantor and is
an absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty of payment and
performance, as the case may be, of the Obligations and not of collectibility,
and is in no way conditioned on or contingent upon any attempt to enforce in
whole or in part Borrower's or any other Portfolio Entity's liabilities and
obligations to the Banks. If Borrower shall fail to pay or perform, as the case
may be, any of the Obligations to the Banks as and when they are due, Guarantor
shall forthwith pay or perform, as the case may be, such Obligations immediately
(in the case of payment obligations, in immediately available funds). Each
failure by Borrower to pay or perform, as the case may be, any Obligations shall
give rise to a separate cause of action herewith, and separate suits may be
brought hereunder as each cause of action arises.

                                        2

                  (c) The Banks may, at any time and from time to time (whether
or not after revocation or termination of this Guaranty) without the consent of
or notice to Guarantor, except such notice as may be required by the Credit
Documents or applicable law which cannot be waived, without incurring
responsibility to Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in
part, (i) change the manner, place and terms of payment or performance or change
or extend the time of payment or performance of, or renew or alter, any
Obligation, or any obligations and liabilities (including any of those
hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof or in
any manner modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Credit Documents
(including provisions with respect to the Completion of the Projects), any
documents, instruments or agreements executed in connection therewith, in each
case with the consent of Borrower or such other relevant Portfolio Entity, if
required by the Credit Documents, and the guaranty herein made shall apply to
the Obligations changed, extended, renewed, modified, amended, supplemented or
altered in any manner; (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or others (including Guarantor) or
otherwise act or refrain from acting; (iii) add or release any other guarantor
from its obligations without affecting or impairing the obligations of Guarantor
hereunder; (iv) settle or compromise any Obligations and/or any obligations and
liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly
in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment or performance of
all or any part thereof to the payment or performance of any obligations and
liabilities which may be due to the Banks or others; (v) sell, exchange,
release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner or in any
order any property by whomsoever pledged or mortgaged to secure or howsoever
securing the Obligations or any liabilities or obligations (including any of
those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof
and/or any offset thereagainst; (vi) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or
howsoever realized to any obligations and liabilities of Borrower or any other
Portfolio Entity to the Banks under the Credit Documents in the manner provided
therein regardless of what obligations and liabilities remain unpaid; (vii)
consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, the
Credit Documents (including provisions with respect to the Completion of the
Projects) or otherwise amend, modify or supplement (with the consent of Borrower
or such other relevant Portfolio Entity, if required by the Credit Documents)
the Credit Documents (including provisions with respect to the Completion of the
Projects) or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or (viii) act or
fail to act in any manner referred to in this Guaranty which may deprive
Guarantor of its right to subrogation against Borrower to recover full indemnity
for any payments or performances made pursuant to this Guaranty or of its right
of contribution against any other party.

                  (d) No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the
obligations or liabilities hereby guaranteed shall affect, impair or be a
defense to this Guaranty, which is a primary obligation of Guarantor.

                  (e) This is a continuing Guaranty and all obligations to which
it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. In the event that, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 1(a) hereof, this Guaranty shall be deemed revocable in
accordance with applicable law, then any such revocation shall become effective
only upon receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of revocation signed
by Guarantor. No revocation or termination hereof shall affect in any manner
rights arising under this Guaranty with respect to Obligations arising prior to
receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of such revocation or
termination.

                  (f) (i) Except as otherwise required by law, each payment
required to be made by Guarantor to the Banks hereunder shall be made without
deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxes. If such deduction or
withholding is so required, Guarantor shall, upon notice thereof

                                        3

<PAGE>



from Administrative Agent, (A) pay the amount required to be deducted or
withheld to the appropriate authorities before penalties attach thereto or
interest accrues thereon, (B) on or before the 60th day after payment of such
amount, forward to the Banks an official receipt evidencing such payment (or a
certified copy thereof), and (C) in the case of any such deduction or
withholding, forthwith pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks
such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
actually received by the Banks is free and clear of such Taxes, including any
Taxes on such additional amount, is equal to the amount that the Banks would
have received had there been no such deduction or withholding.

                            (ii) As used herein, the term "Tax" means any
present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any
nature (including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by
any government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under this
Guaranty other than (A) any income, franchise or similar tax imposed upon the
gross or net income of Administrative Agent or any Bank by the United States,
New York State, any jurisdiction where Administrative Agent or any Bank is
organized and/or the jurisdiction in which is located any office from or at
which Administrative Agent or any Bank is making or maintaining any Loans or
receiving any payments under any of the Credit Documents and (B) any stamp,
registration, documentation or similar tax.

                  (g) In fulfilling its obligations hereunder with respect to
the Obligations set forth in Section 1(a)(i) hereof, but subject to the
provisions of Section 5.14 of the Credit Agreement, Guarantor hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally guarantees, promises and agrees to perform and comply with
Section 5.14 of the Credit Agreement. The words "perform and comply with" are
used in their most comprehensive sense and include without limitation (i) the
payment of all costs and expenses with respect to the construction of the Funded
Projects and the construction of such Projects within the time and in the manner
set forth in Section 5.14 of the Credit Agreement, (ii) the payment,
satisfaction or discharge of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens other than
the Liens described in clause (c) of the definition of "Permitted Liens")
arising out of or relating to the construction and Completion of, and that are
or may be imposed upon or asserted against, the Funded Projects and (iii) the
defense and indemnification of the Banks against all such Liens, whether arising
from the furnishing of labor, materials, supplies or equipment, from taxes,
assessments, fees or other charges, from injuries or damage to persons or
property, or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Guarantor agrees (A) to cause any and all costs of achieving Completion of each
of the Funded Projects, including without limitation the costs of all labor,
materials, supplies and equipment related thereto and any and all costs and cost
overruns prior to such Completion, to be funded, paid and satisfied from
Guarantor's own resources as the same shall become due and (B) to cause the
Completion of each of the Funded Projects, using Guarantor's own resources, in a
timely, good and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Documents; provided, however, that Guarantor shall not be required to pay any
performance and/or other liquidated damages due and owing from a Contractor
(other than a Contractor that is an Affiliate of Guarantor) under a Construction
Contract; provided, further, Guarantor's liability with respect to such
liquidated damages shall be limited to the amount specified in clause (vi)(B) of
the definition of "Completion" less the amount of any such liquidated damages
determined to be due and owing from any applicable Contractors.

         2. Representations and Warranties. Guarantor makes the representations
and warranties set forth below to Administrative Agent and the Banks as of the
date hereof:

<PAGE>

covenants set forth in this Section 3(f).

Capitalized terms used in this Section 3(f) and defined in Appendix A attached
hereto shall have the meanings given therein.

         4. Waiver. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and
remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to
assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including without
limitation (a) any right to require Administrative Agent or the Banks to proceed
against Borrower or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any
security held by Administrative Agent or the Banks at any time or to pursue any
other remedy in Administrative Agent's or the Banks' power before proceeding
against Guarantor, (b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity,
lack of power or authority, death, dissolution, merger, termination or
disability of Borrower or any other Person or the failure of Administrative
Agent or the Banks to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in
administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of Borrower or any other
Person, (c) demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind except as
provided herein, including without limitation notice of the existence, creation
or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any
action or non-action on the part of Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Banks,
any endorser or creditor of Borrower or Guarantor or on the part of any other
Person under this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or
evidence of indebtedness held by Administrative Agent or the Banks as collateral
or in connection with any Obligations, (d) any defense based upon an election of
remedies by Administrative Agent or the Banks, including without limitation an
election to proceed by non-judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which
destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of Guarantor, the right of
Guarantor to proceed against Borrower for reimbursement, or both, (e) any
defense based on any offset against any amounts which may be owed by any Person
to Guarantor for any reason whatsoever, (f) any defense based on any act,
failure to act, delay or omission whatsoever on the part of Borrower or any
other Portfolio Entity of the failure by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
to do any act or thing or to observe or perform any covenant, condition or
agreement to be observed or performed by it under the Credit Documents, (g) any
defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation
of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more
burdensome than that of the principal provided, that, upon payment or
performance in full of the Obligations, this Guaranty shall no longer be of any
force or effect, (h) any defense, setoff or counterclaim which may at any time
be available to or asserted by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity against
Administrative Agent, the Banks or any other Person under the Credit Documents,
(i) any duty on the part of Administrative Agent or the Banks to disclose to
Guarantor any facts Administrative Agent or the Banks may now or hereafter know
about Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, regardless of whether
Administrative Agent or the Banks have reason to believe that any such facts
materially increase the risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to assume, or
have reason to believe that such facts are unknown to Guarantor, or have a
reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Guarantor, since Guarantor
acknowledges that Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping informed
of the financial condition of Borrower and the other Portfolio Entities and of
all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment or non-performance of any
obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed, (j) the fact that Guarantor may
at any time in the future dispose of all or part of its direct or indirect
interest in Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, (k) any defense based on any
change in the time, manner or place of any payment or performance under, or in
any other term of, the Credit Documents (including provisions with respect to
the Completion of the Projects) or any other amendment, renewal, extension,
acceleration, compromise or waiver of or any consent or departure from the terms
of the Credit Documents (including provisions with respect to the Completion of
the Projects), (l) any defense arising because of Administrative Agent's or the
Banks' election, in any proceeding instituted under the Federal Bankruptcy Code,
of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, and (m)
any

                                        7

<PAGE>



defense based upon any borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section
364 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

         5. Subordination. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Guaranty, all existing and future indebtedness of Borrower or any other
Portfolio Entity to Guarantor (except to the extent such indebtedness consists
of approved operating expenses or other O&M Costs with respect to materials or
services provided consistent with an applicable Annual Operating Budget) and the
right of Guarantor to withdraw any capital invested by Guarantor in Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity, is hereby subordinated to all obligations and
liabilities hereby guaranteed. Without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent, such subordinated indebtedness shall not be paid or
withdrawn in whole or in part, nor shall Guarantor accept any payment of or on
account of any such indebtedness or as a withdrawal of capital while the Credit
Agreement is in effect except from distributions permitted under Waterfall Level
8 and 10 of Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement or as permitted under Section
3.10(b) of the Credit Agreement. Any payment by Borrower in violation of this
Guaranty shall be received by Guarantor in trust for Administrative Agent and
the Banks, and Guarantor shall cause the same to be paid to Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Banks immediately upon demand by Administrative Agent on
account of Borrower's obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed. Guarantor
shall not assign all or any portion of such indebtedness while the Credit
Agreement remains in effect except upon prior written notice to Administrative
Agent by which the assignee of any such indebtedness agrees that the assignment
is made subject to the terms of this Guaranty, and that any attempted assignment
of such indebtedness in violation of the provisions hereof shall be void.

         6. Subrogation. So long as the Credit Agreement remains in effect, (a)
Guarantor shall not have any right of subrogation and waives all rights to
enforce any remedy which the Banks now have or may hereafter have against
Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, and waives the benefit of, and all
rights to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Administrative
Agent or the Banks from Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity and (b) Guarantor
waives any claim, right or remedy which Guarantor may now have or hereafter
acquire against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity that arises hereunder
and/or from the performance by Guarantor hereunder including, without
limitation, any claim, remedy or right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution, indemnification, or participation in any claim, right
or remedy of the Banks against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or any
security which the Banks now have or hereafter acquire, whether or not such
claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under
common law or otherwise.

         7. Bankruptcy.

                  (a) So long as the Credit Agreement remains in effect,
Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent,
commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, or insolvency proceeding against Borrower or any other Portfolio
Entity. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered,
limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement
of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or by any defense which Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity may have by reason of any order, decree or decision
of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

                  (b) So long as the Credit Agreement remains in effect, to the
extent of any Obligations, Guarantor shall file, in any bankruptcy or other
proceeding in which the filing of claims is required or permitted by law, all
claims which Guarantor may have against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
relating to any indebtedness of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity to
Guarantor, and hereby assigns to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks all
rights of Guarantor thereunder. If

                                        8

<PAGE>



Guarantor does not file any such claim, Administrative Agent, as
attorney-in-fact for Guarantor, is hereby authorized to do so in the name of
Guarantor or, in Administrative Agent's discretion, to assign the claim to a
nominee and to cause proofs of claim to be filed in the name of Administrative
Agent's nominee. The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and
cannot be revoked. Administrative Agent or its nominee shall have the sole right
to accept or reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any
other action which a party filing a claim is entitled to take. In all such
cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person authorized
to pay such a claim shall pay the same to Administrative Agent to the extent of
any Obligations which then remain unpaid, and, to the full extent necessary for
that purpose, Guarantor hereby assigns to Administrative Agent all of
Guarantor's rights to all such payments or distributions to which Guarantor
would otherwise be entitled; provided, however, that Guarantor's obligations
hereunder shall not be satisfied except to the extent that Administrative Agent
receives cash by reason of any such payment or distribution. If Administrative
Agent receives anything hereunder other than cash, the same shall be held as
collateral for amounts due under this Guaranty.

         8. Successions or Assignments.

                  (a) This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the successors
or assigns of the Banks who shall have, to the extent of their interest, the
rights of the Banks hereunder; provided, however, that the rights of the Banks
hereunder, if any be retained by them, shall have priority over and be senior to
the rights of its successors or assigns unless Administrative Agent shall
otherwise elect.

                  (b) This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor and its successors
and assigns. Guarantor is not entitled to assign its obligations hereunder to
any other person without the written consent of Administrative Agent, and any
purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

         9. Waivers.

                  (a) No delay on the part of Administrative Agent or the Banks
in exercising any of their rights (including those hereunder) and no partial or
single exercise thereof and no action or non-action by Administrative Agent or
the Banks, with or without notice to Guarantor or anyone else, shall constitute
a waiver of any rights or shall affect or impair this Guaranty.

                  (b) GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY OR RELATING
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS GUARANTY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUARANTOR
AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS
GUARANTY, AND THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN
THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT
HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL.

         10. Interpretation. The section headings in this Guaranty are for the
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or construction
of any provision hereof.

<PAGE>



         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged and as an inducement to Administrative Agent and the Banks
to enter into the Credit Agreement with Borrower, Guarantor hereby consents and
agrees as follows:

         1. Guaranty.

                  (a) The undersigned Guarantor, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Banks (i)
the payment, when due, of the obligations of Borrower under Section 6.4.2(h) of
the Credit Agreement, (ii) without duplication of amounts paid pursuant to
clause (i) above, the payment, when due, of the obligations of Borrower under
Section 5.17.3(y) of the Credit Agreement and (iii) if Borrower is unable to
obtain a disbursement of Loan proceeds under the Credit Agreement for any Funded
Turbine for a period of 60 consecutive days after a request for the same
pursuant to a Turbine Purchase Drawdown Certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 3.6 of the Credit Agreement, the prompt payment, when due, of the
Turbine Costs for which funds were requested in such Turbine Purchase Drawdown
Certificate, in each case together with the payment of all expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent or the Banks in enforcing any of such obligations and
liabilities or the terms hereof, including, without limitation, reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel (collectively, the "Obligations"), and agrees that
if for any reason Borrower shall fail to pay when due any of such Obligations,
Guarantor will pay the same forthwith. Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of
this Guaranty and of any obligation to which it applies or may apply under the
terms hereof, and waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment or
performance, notice of dishonor or non-payment or non-performance, protest,
notice of protest, of any such obligations, suit or taking other action by the
Banks against, and giving any notice of default or other notice to, or making
any demand on, any party liable thereon (including Guarantor).

                  (b) This Guaranty is a primary obligation of Guarantor and is
an absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty of payment of
the Obligations and not of collectibility, and is in no way conditioned on or
contingent upon any attempt to enforce in whole or in part Borrower's or any
other Portfolio Entity's liabilities and obligations to the Banks. If Borrower
shall fail to pay any of the Obligations to the Banks as and when they are due,
Guarantor shall forthwith pay such Obligations immediately (in the case of
payment obligations, in immediately available funds). Each failure by Borrower
to pay any Obligations shall give rise to a separate cause of action herewith,
and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises.

                  (c) The Banks may, at any time and from time to time (whether
or not after revocation or termination of this Guaranty) without the consent of
or notice to Guarantor, except such notice as may be required by the Credit
Documents or applicable law which cannot be waived, without incurring
responsibility to Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in
part, (i) change the manner, place and terms of payment or change or extend the
time of payment of, or renew or alter, any Obligation, or any obligations and
liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly
in respect thereof or hereof or in any manner modify,

                                        2

<PAGE>



amend or supplement the terms of the Credit Documents, any documents,
instruments or agreements executed in connection therewith, in each case with
the consent of Borrower or such other relevant Portfolio Entity, if required by
the Credit Documents, and the guaranty herein made shall apply to the
Obligations changed, extended, renewed, modified, amended, supplemented or
altered in any manner; (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or others (including Guarantor) or
otherwise act or refrain from acting; (iii) add or release any other guarantor
from its obligations without affecting or impairing the obligations of Guarantor
hereunder; (iv) settle or compromise any Obligations and/or any obligations and
liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly
in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment or performance of
all or any part thereof to the payment or performance of any obligations and
liabilities which may be due to the Banks or others; (v) sell, exchange,
release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner or in any
order any property by whomsoever pledged or mortgaged to secure or howsoever
securing the Obligations or any liabilities or obligations (including any of
those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof
and/or any offset thereagainst; (vi) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or
howsoever realized to any obligations and liabilities of Borrower or any other
Portfolio Entity to the Banks under the Credit Documents in the manner provided
therein regardless of what obligations and liabilities remain unpaid; (vii)
consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, the
Credit Documents or otherwise amend, modify or supplement (with the consent of
Borrower or such other relevant Portfolio Entity, if required by the Credit
Documents) the Credit Documents or any of such other instruments or agreements;
and/or (viii) act or fail to act in any manner referred to in this Guaranty
which may deprive Guarantor of its right to subrogation against Borrower to
recover full indemnity for any payments or performances made pursuant to this
Guaranty or of its right of contribution against any other party.

                  (d) No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the
obligations or liabilities hereby guaranteed shall affect, impair or be a
defense to this Guaranty, which is a primary obligation of Guarantor.

                  (e) This is a continuing Guaranty and all obligations to which
it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. In the event that, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 1(a) hereof, this Guaranty shall be deemed revocable in
accordance with applicable law, then any such revocation shall become effective
only upon receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of revocation signed
by Guarantor. No revocation or termination hereof shall affect in any manner
rights arising under this Guaranty with respect to Obligations arising prior to
receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of such revocation or
termination.

                  (f) (i) Except as otherwise required by law, each payment
required to be made by Guarantor to the Banks hereunder shall be made without
deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxes. If such deduction or
withholding is so required, Guarantor shall, upon notice thereof from
Administrative Agent, (A) pay the amount required to be deducted or withheld to
the appropriate authorities before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues
thereon, (B) on or before the 60th day after payment of such amount, forward to
the Banks an official

                                        3

<PAGE>



receipt evidencing such payment (or a certified copy thereof), and (C) in the
case of any such deduction or withholding, forthwith pay to Administrative Agent
for the account of the Banks such additional amount as may be necessary to
ensure that the net amount actually received by the Banks is free and clear of
such Taxes, including any Taxes on such additional amount, is equal to the
amount that the Banks would have received had there been no such deduction or
withholding.

                            (ii) As used herein, the term "Tax" means any
present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any
nature (including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by
any government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under this
Guaranty other than (A) any income, franchise or similar tax imposed upon the
gross or net income of Administrative Agent or any Bank by the United States,
New York State, any jurisdiction where Administrative Agent or any Bank is
organized and/or the jurisdiction in which is located any office from or at
which Administrative Agent or any Bank is making or maintaining any Loans or
receiving any payments under any of the Credit Documents and (B) any stamp,
registration, documentation or similar tax.

<PAGE>



                  (b) It will comply in all material respects with all

         4. Waiver. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and
remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to
assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including without
limitation (a) any right to require Administrative Agent or the Banks to proceed
against Borrower or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any
security held by Administrative Agent or the Banks at any time or to pursue any
other remedy in Administrative Agent's or the Banks' power before proceeding
against Guarantor, (b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity,
lack of power or authority, death, dissolution, merger, termination or
disability of Borrower or any other Person or the failure of Administrative
Agent or the Banks to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in
administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of Borrower or any other
Person, (c) demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind except as
provided herein, including without limitation notice of the existence, creation
or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any
action or non-action on the part of Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Banks,
any endorser or creditor of Borrower or Guarantor or on the part of any other
Person under this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or
evidence of indebtedness held by Administrative Agent or the Banks as collateral
or in connection with any Obligations, (d) any defense based upon an election of
remedies by Administrative Agent or the Banks, including without limitation an
election to proceed by non-judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which
destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of Guarantor, the right of
Guarantor to proceed against Borrower for reimbursement, or both, (e) any
defense based on any offset against any amounts which may be owed by any Person
to Guarantor for any reason whatsoever, (f) any defense based on any act,
failure to act, delay or omission whatsoever on the part of Borrower or any
other Portfolio Entity of the failure by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
to do any act or thing or to observe or perform any covenant, condition or
agreement to be observed or performed by it under the Credit Documents, (g) any
defense based upon any statute

                                        6

<PAGE>



or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither
larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal provided, that, upon payment in full of the Obligations, this Guaranty
shall no longer be of any force or effect, (h) any defense, setoff or
counterclaim which may at any time be available to or asserted by Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity against Administrative Agent, the Banks or any other
Person under the Credit Documents, (i) any duty on the part of Administrative
Agent or the Banks to disclose to Guarantor any facts Administrative Agent or
the Banks may now or hereafter know about Borrower or any other Portfolio
Entity, regardless of whether Administrative Agent or the Banks have reason to
believe that any such facts materially increase the risk beyond that which
Guarantor intends to assume, or have reason to believe that such facts are
unknown to Guarantor, or have a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts
to Guarantor, since Guarantor acknowledges that Guarantor is fully responsible
for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Borrower and the
other Portfolio Entities and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of
non-payment of any obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed, (j) the fact
that Guarantor may at any time in the future dispose of all or part of its
direct or indirect interest in Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, (k) any
defense based on any change in the time, manner or place of any payment under,
or in any other term of, the Credit Documents or any other amendment, renewal,
extension, acceleration, compromise or waiver of or any consent or departure
from the terms of the Credit Documents, (l) any defense arising because of
Administrative Agent's or the Banks' election, in any proceeding instituted
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code, and (m) any defense based upon any borrowing or
grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

         5. Subordination. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Guaranty, all existing and future indebtedness of Borrower or any other
Portfolio Entity to Guarantor (except to the extent such indebtedness consists
of approved operating expenses or other O&M Costs with respect to materials or
services provided consistent with an applicable Annual Operating Budget) and the
right of Guarantor to withdraw any capital invested by Guarantor in Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity, is hereby subordinated to all obligations and
liabilities hereby guaranteed. Without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent, such subordinated indebtedness shall not be paid or
withdrawn in whole or in part, nor shall Guarantor accept any payment of or on
account of any such indebtedness or as a withdrawal of capital while the Credit
Agreement is in effect except from distributions permitted under Waterfall Level
8 and 10 of Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement or as permitted under Section
3.10(b) of the Credit Agreement. Any payment by Borrower in violation of this
Guaranty shall be received by Guarantor in trust for Administrative Agent and
the Banks, and Guarantor shall cause the same to be paid to Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Banks immediately upon demand by Administrative Agent on
account of Borrower's obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed. Guarantor
shall not assign all or any portion of such indebtedness while the Credit
Agreement remains in effect except upon prior written notice to Administrative
Agent by which the assignee of any such indebtedness agrees that the assignment
is made subject to the terms of this Guaranty, and that any attempted assignment
of such indebtedness in violation of the provisions hereof shall be void.

                                        7

<PAGE>



         6. Subrogation. So long as the Credit Agreement remains in effect, (a)
Guarantor shall not have any right of subrogation and waives all rights to
enforce any remedy which the Banks now have or may hereafter have against
Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, and waives the benefit of, and all
rights to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Administrative
Agent or the Banks from Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity and (b) Guarantor
waives any claim, right or remedy which Guarantor may now have or hereafter
acquire against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity that arises hereunder
and/or from the performance by Guarantor hereunder including, without
limitation, any claim, remedy or right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution, indemnification, or participation in any claim, right
or remedy of the Banks against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or any
security which the Banks now have or hereafter acquire, whether or not such
claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under
common law or otherwise.

         7. Bankruptcy.

                  (a) So long as the Credit Agreement remains in effect,
Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent,
commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, or insolvency proceeding against Borrower or any other Portfolio
Entity. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered,
limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement
of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or by any defense which Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity may have by reason of any order, decree or decision
of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

                  (b) So long as the Credit Agreement remains in effect, to the
extent of any Obligations, Guarantor shall file, in any bankruptcy or other
proceeding in which the filing of claims is required or permitted by law, all
claims which Guarantor may have against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
relating to any indebtedness of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity to
Guarantor, and hereby assigns to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks all
rights of Guarantor thereunder. If Guarantor does not file any such claim,
Administrative Agent, as attorney-in-fact for Guarantor, is hereby authorized to
do so in the name of Guarantor or, in Administrative Agent's discretion, to
assign the claim to a nominee and to cause proofs of claim to be filed in the
name of Administrative Agent's nominee. The foregoing power of attorney is
coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. Administrative Agent or its
nominee shall have the sole right to accept or reject any plan proposed in any
such proceeding and to take any other action which a party filing a claim is
entitled to take. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or
otherwise, the person authorized to pay such a claim shall pay the same to
Administrative Agent to the extent of any Obligations which then remain unpaid,
and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, Guarantor hereby assigns to
Administrative Agent all of Guarantor's rights to all such payments or
distributions to which Guarantor would otherwise be entitled; provided, however,
that Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not be satisfied except to the
extent that Administrative Agent receives cash by reason of any such payment or
distribution. If Administrative Agent receives anything hereunder other than
cash, the same shall be held as collateral for amounts due under this Guaranty.

         8. Successions or Assignments.

                  (a) This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the successors
or assigns of the Banks who shall have, to the extent of their interest, the
rights of the Banks hereunder; provided, however, that the rights of the Banks
hereunder, if any be retained by them, shall have priority over and be senior to
the rights of its successors or assigns unless Administrative Agent shall
otherwise elect.

                  (b) This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor and its successors
and assigns. Guarantor is not entitled to assign its obligations hereunder to
any other person without the written consent of Administrative Agent, and any
purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

         9. Waivers.

                  (a) No delay on the part of Administrative Agent or the Banks
in exercising any of their rights (including those hereunder) and no partial or
single exercise thereof and no action or non-action by Administrative Agent or
the Banks, with or without notice to Guarantor or anyone else, shall constitute
a waiver of any rights or shall affect or impair this Guaranty.

                  (b) GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY OR RELATING
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS GUARANTY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUARANTOR
AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS
GUARANTY, AND THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN
THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT
HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL.

         10. Interpretation. The section headings in this Guaranty are for the

which are hereby acknowledged and as an inducement to Administrative Agent and
the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement with Borrower and the other Credit

<PAGE>



         1. Guaranty.

                  (a) The undersigned Guarantor, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Banks the
punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise of all of the Obligations of the Portfolio Entities under the Credit
Documents, including without limitation the Obligations of Borrower under the
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, in each case together with the
payment of all expenses incurred by Administrative Agent or the Banks in
enforcing any of such obligations and liabilities or the terms hereof,
including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel,
but expressly excluding any Obligations (including expenses of enforcement and
the fees and expenses of legal counsel related thereto) arising out of or
attributable to Projects which have achieved Operation prior to the effective
date of this Guaranty (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and agrees
that if for any reason Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity shall fail to pay
when due any of such Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor will pay the same
forthwith. Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and of any
obligation to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof, and waives
diligence, presentment, demand of payment or performance, notice of dishonor or
non-payment or non-performance, protest, notice of protest, of any such
obligations, suit or taking other action by the Banks against, and giving any
notice of default or other notice to, or making any demand on, any party liable
thereon (including Guarantor).

                  (b) This Guaranty is a primary obligation of Guarantor and is
an absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty of payment of
the Guaranteed Obligations and not of collectibility, and is in no way
conditioned on or contingent upon any attempt to enforce in whole or in part
Borrower's or any other Portfolio Entity's liabilities and obligations to the
Banks. If Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity shall fail to pay any of the
Guaranteed Obligations to the Banks as and when they are due, Guarantor shall
forthwith pay such Guaranteed Obligations immediately (in immediately available
funds). Each failure by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity to pay any
Guaranteed Obligations shall give rise to a separate cause of action herewith,
and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises.

                  (c) The Banks may, at any time and from time to time (whether
or not after revocation or termination of this Guaranty) without the consent of
or notice to Guarantor, except such notice as may be required by the Credit
Documents or applicable law which cannot be waived, without incurring
responsibility to Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in
part, (i) change the manner, place and terms of payment or performance or change
or extend the time of payment or performance of, or renew or alter, any
Obligation, or any obligations and liabilities (including any of those
hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof or in
any manner modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Credit Documents, any
documents, instruments or agreements executed in connection therewith, in each
case with the consent of Borrower or such other relevant Portfolio Entity, if
required by the Credit Documents, and the guaranty herein made shall apply to
the Guaranteed Obligations changed, extended, renewed, modified, amended,
supplemented or altered in any manner; (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising
any rights against Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or others (including
Guarantor) or otherwise act or refrain from acting; (iii) add or release any
other guarantor from its obligations without affecting or impairing the
obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (iv) settle or compromise any Guaranteed
Obligations and/or any obligations and liabilities (including any of those
hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may
subordinate the payment or performance of all or any part thereof to the payment
or performance of any obligations and liabilities which may be due to the Banks
or others; (v) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise

                                        2

<PAGE>



deal with in any manner or in any order any property by whomsoever pledged or
mortgaged to secure or howsoever securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any
liabilities or obligations (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly
or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof and/or any offset thereagainst; (vi)
apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligations and
liabilities of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity to the Banks under the
Credit Documents in the manner provided therein regardless of what obligations
and liabilities remain unpaid; (vii) consent to or waive any breach of, or any
act, omission or default under, the Credit Documents or otherwise amend, modify
or supplement (with the consent of Borrower or such other relevant Portfolio
Entity, if required by the Credit Documents) the Credit Documents or any of such
other instruments or agreements; and/or (viii) act or fail to act in any manner
referred to in this Guaranty which may deprive Guarantor of its right to
subrogation against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity to recover full
indemnity for any payments or performances made pursuant to this Guaranty or of
its right of contribution against any other party.

                  (d) No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the
obligations or liabilities hereby guaranteed shall affect, impair or be a
defense to this Guaranty, which is a primary obligation of Guarantor.

                  (e) This is a continuing Guaranty and all obligations to which
it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. In the event that, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 1(a) hereof, this Guaranty shall be deemed revocable in
accordance with applicable law, then any such revocation shall become effective
only upon receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of revocation signed
by Guarantor. No revocation or termination hereof shall affect in any manner
rights arising under this Guaranty with respect to Guaranteed Obligations
arising prior to receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of such
revocation or termination.

                  (f) (i) Except as otherwise required by law, each payment
required to be made by Guarantor to the Banks hereunder shall be made without
deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxes. If such deduction or
withholding is so required, Guarantor shall, upon notice thereof from
Administrative Agent, (A) pay the amount required to be deducted or withheld to
the appropriate authorities before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues
thereon, (B) on or before the 60th day after payment of such amount, forward to
the Banks an official receipt evidencing such payment (or a certified copy
thereof), and (C) in the case of any such deduction or withholding, forthwith
pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks such additional amount
as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Banks
is free and clear of such Taxes, including any Taxes on such additional amount,
is equal to the amount that the Banks would have received had there been no such
deduction or withholding.

                      (ii) As used herein, the term "Tax" means any present or
future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any nature
(including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by any
government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under this
Guaranty other than (A) any income, franchise or similar tax imposed upon the
gross or net income of Administrative Agent or any Bank by the United States,
New York State, any jurisdiction where Administrative Agent or any Bank is
organized and/or the jurisdiction in which is located any office from or at
which Administrative Agent or any Bank is making or maintaining any Loans or
receiving any payments under any of the Credit Documents and (B) any stamp,
registration, documentation or similar tax.

         2. Representations and Warranties. Guarantor makes the representations
and warranties set forth below to Administrative Agent and the Banks as of the
date hereof:

                  (a) Guarantor is duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the power and authority
to execute and deliver this Guaranty and to perform its obligations hereunder.

                  (b) Guarantor has taken all necessary action to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of its obligations
hereunder.

                  (c) All governmental authorizations and actions necessary in
connection with the execution and delivery by Guarantor of this Guaranty and the
performance of its obligations hereunder have been obtained or performed and
remain valid and in full force and effect.

                  (d) This Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by
Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor,
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally.

                  (e) The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty
(i) do not and will not contravene any provisions of Guarantor's constituent
documents, or any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to
or binding on Guarantor or any of its Affiliates or properties; (ii) do not and
will not contravene, or result in any breach of or constitute any default under,
any agreement or instrument to which Guarantor is a party or by which Guarantor
or any of its properties may be bound or affected; and (iii) do not and will not
require the consent of any Person under any existing law or agreement which has
not already been obtained.

                  (f) There is no pending or, to the best of Guarantor's
knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting Guarantor before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator, which might reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of Guarantor or the ability of Guarantor to perform its
obligations under this Guaranty.

                  (g) All of Guarantor's quarterly and annual financial
statements heretofore delivered by Borrower to Administrative Agent are true,
correct and complete, do not fail to disclose any material liabilities, whether
direct or contingent, fairly present the financial condition of Guarantor as of
the date delivered and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied.

                  (h) Guarantor possesses all franchises, certificates,
licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations and approvals necessary
for it to own its properties, conduct its businesses and perform its obligations
under this Guaranty.

                  (i) Guarantor is not an investment company or a company
controlled by an investment company, within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, and is not subject to, or is exempt from, regulation under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the Federal Power Act.

                                        4

<PAGE>



                  (j) Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining
financial and other information pertaining to the businesses, operations and
condition (financial and otherwise) of Borrower and the other Portfolio Entities
and their respective properties on a continuing basis, and Guarantor now is and
hereafter will be completely familiar with the businesses, operations and
condition (financial and otherwise) of Borrower and the other Portfolio Entities
and their respective properties.

                  (k) (i) Guarantor is not, and will not as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty, be rendered insolvent, (ii) Guarantor
does not intend to incur, or believe it is incurring, obligations beyond its
ability to pay or perform and (iii) Guarantor's property remaining after the
delivery and performance of this Guaranty will not constitute unreasonably small
capital. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, enforcement of the liability of
Guarantor under this Guaranty for the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations
would be an unlawful or voidable transfer under any applicable fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or any comparable law, then the liability
of Guarantor hereunder shall be reduced to the highest amount for which such
liability may then be enforced without giving rise to an unlawful or voidable
transfer under any such law.

                  (l) Guarantor is not in default under any material agreement
relating to the incurrence of debt to which it is a party.

         3. Covenants. So long as any Guaranteed Obligations are outstanding,
Guarantor agrees that:

                  (a) It will maintain in full force and effect all consents of
any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with
respect to this Guaranty and will obtain any that may become necessary in the
future;

                  (b) It will comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply
would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this
Guaranty;

                  (c) Promptly, and in any event within 30 Banking Days after
the General Counsel of Guarantor obtains knowledge thereof, Guarantor will give
to Administrative Agent notice of the occurrence of any event or of any
litigation or governmental proceeding pending (i) against Guarantor or any of
its Affiliates which could affect the business, operations, property, assets or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor so as to materially and
adversely affect the ability of Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder
or (ii) with respect to this Guaranty, which event or pending proceeding is
likely to materially and adversely affect the business, operations, property,
assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Guarantor;

                  (d) It will deliver such other documents and other information
reasonably requested by Administrative Agent;

                  (e) It will comply in all material respects with its
constituent documents;

                  (f) It will perform, or cause Borrower to perform, each of the
covenants and other agreements contained in Articles 5 and 6 of the Credit
Agreement as if such covenants and other agreements were fully set forth in this
Guaranty, such agreements and other covenants being incorporated into this
Guaranty by reference; provided, however, that performance of such covenants by
Borrower or another Portfolio Entity will satisfy Guarantor's obligations
hereunder with respect to such covenants.

                                        5

<PAGE>



         4. Waiver. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and
remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to
assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including without
limitation (a) any right to require Administrative Agent or the Banks to proceed
against Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or any other Person or to proceed
against or exhaust any security held by Administrative Agent or the Banks at any
time or to pursue any other remedy in Administrative Agent's or the Banks' power
before proceeding against Guarantor, (b) any defense that may arise by reason of
the incapacity, lack of power or authority, death, dissolution, merger,
termination or disability of Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or any other
Person or the failure of Administrative Agent or the Banks to file or enforce a
claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding)
of Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or any other Person, (c) demand,
presentment, protest and notice of any kind except as provided herein, including
without limitation notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or
additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part
of Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity, Administrative Agent, the Banks, any
endorser or creditor of Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or Guarantor or on
the part of any other Person under this or any other instrument in connection
with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by Administrative Agent or
the Banks as collateral or in connection with any Guaranteed Obligations, (d)
any defense based upon an election of remedies by Administrative Agent or the
Banks, including without limitation an election to proceed by non-judicial
rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or otherwise impairs the
subrogation rights of Guarantor, the right of Guarantor to proceed against
Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity for reimbursement, or both, (e) any
defense based on any offset against any amounts which may be owed by any Person
to Guarantor for any reason whatsoever, (f) any defense based on any act,
failure to act, delay or omission whatsoever on the part of Borrower or any
other Portfolio Entity of the failure by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
to do any act or thing or to observe or perform any covenant, condition or
agreement to be observed or performed by it under the Credit Documents, (g) any
defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation
of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more
burdensome than that of the principal provided, that, upon payment or
performance in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, this Guaranty shall no longer
be of any force or effect, (h) any defense, setoff or counterclaim which may at
any time be available to or asserted by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
against Administrative Agent, the Banks or any other Person under the Credit
Documents, (i) any duty on the part of Administrative Agent or the Banks to
disclose to Guarantor any facts Administrative Agent or the Banks may now or
hereafter know about Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, regardless of
whether Administrative Agent or the Banks have reason to believe that any such
facts materially increase the risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to
assume, or have reason to believe that such facts are unknown to Guarantor, or
have a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Guarantor, since
Guarantor acknowledges that Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of Borrower and the other Portfolio Entities
and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment or non-performance
of any obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed, (j) the fact that
Guarantor may at any time in the future dispose of all or part of its direct or
indirect interest in Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, (k) any defense
based on any change in the time, manner or place of any payment or performance
under, or in any other term of, the Credit Documents or any other amendment,
renewal, extension, acceleration, compromise or waiver of or any consent or
departure from the terms of the Credit Documents, (l) any defense arising
because of Administrative Agent's or the Banks' election, in any proceeding
instituted under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section
1111(b)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, and (m) any defense based upon any
borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code.

         5. Subordination. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Guaranty, all existing and future indebtedness of Borrower or any other
Portfolio Entity to Guarantor (except to the extent such indebtedness consists
of approved operating expenses or other O&M Costs with respect to materials or
services provided consistent with an applicable Annual Operating Budget) and the
right of Guarantor to withdraw any capital invested by Guarantor in Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity, is hereby subordinated to all obligations and
liabilities hereby guaranteed. Without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent, such subordinated indebtedness shall not be paid or
withdrawn in whole or in part, nor shall Guarantor accept any payment of or on
account of any such indebtedness or as a withdrawal of capital while the Credit
Documents are in effect. Any payment by Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity
in violation of this Guaranty shall be received by Guarantor in trust for
Administrative Agent and the Banks, and Guarantor shall cause the same to be
paid to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks immediately upon
demand by Administrative Agent on account of Borrower's and the other Portfolio
Entities' obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed. Guarantor shall not
assign all or any portion of such indebtedness while the Credit Documents remain
in effect except upon prior written notice to Administrative Agent by which the
assignee of any such indebtedness agrees that the assignment is made subject to
the terms of this Guaranty, and that any attempted assignment of such
indebtedness in violation of the provisions hereof shall be void.

         6. Subrogation. So long as the Credit Documents remain in effect, (a)
Guarantor shall not have any right of subrogation and waives all rights to
enforce any remedy which the Banks now have or may hereafter have against
Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, and waives the benefit of, and all
rights to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Administrative
Agent or the Banks from Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity and (b) Guarantor
waives any claim, right or remedy which Guarantor may now have or hereafter
acquire against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity that arises hereunder
and/or from the performance by Guarantor hereunder including, without
limitation, any claim, remedy or right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution, indemnification, or participation in any claim, right
or remedy of the Banks against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or any
security which the Banks now have or hereafter acquire, whether or not such
claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under
common law or otherwise.

         7. Bankruptcy.

                  (a) So long as the Credit Documents remain in effect,
Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent,
commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, or insolvency proceeding against Borrower or any other Portfolio
Entity. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered,
limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement
of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or by any defense which Borrower or
any other Portfolio Entity may have by reason of any order, decree or decision
of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

                  (b) So long as the Credit Documents remain in effect, to the
extent of any Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor shall file, in any bankruptcy or
other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required or permitted by law,
all claims which Guarantor may have against Borrower or any other Portfolio
Entity relating to any indebtedness of Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity to
Guarantor, and hereby assigns to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks all
rights of Guarantor thereunder. If Guarantor does not file any such claim,
Administrative Agent, as attorney-in-fact for Guarantor, is hereby authorized to
do so in the name of Guarantor or, in Administrative Agent's discretion, to
assign the claim to a nominee and to cause proofs of claim to be filed in the
name of Administrative Agent's nominee. The

                                        7

<PAGE>



foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Administrative Agent or its nominee shall have the sole right to accept or
reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any other action
which a party filing a claim is entitled to take. In all such cases, whether in
administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person authorized to pay such a
claim shall pay the same to Administrative Agent to the extent of any Guaranteed
Obligations which then remain unpaid, and, to the full extent necessary for that
purpose, Guarantor hereby assigns to Administrative Agent all of Guarantor's
rights to all such payments or distributions to which Guarantor would otherwise
be entitled; provided, however, that Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not
be satisfied except to the extent that Administrative Agent receives cash by
reason of any such payment or distribution. If Administrative Agent receives
anything hereunder other than cash, the same shall be held as collateral for
amounts due under this Guaranty.

         8. Successions or Assignments.

                  (a) This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the successors
or assigns of the Banks who shall have, to the extent of their interest, the
rights of the Banks hereunder; provided, however, that the rights of the Banks
hereunder, if any be retained by them, shall have priority over and be senior to
the rights of its successors or assigns unless Administrative Agent shall
otherwise elect.

                  (b) This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor and its successors
and assigns. Guarantor is not entitled to assign its obligations hereunder to
any other person without the written consent of Administrative Agent, and any
purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

         9. Waivers.

                  (a) No delay on the part of Administrative Agent or the Banks
in exercising any of their rights (including those hereunder) and no partial or
single exercise thereof and no action or non-action by Administrative Agent or
the Banks, with or without notice to Guarantor or anyone else, shall constitute
a waiver of any rights or shall affect or impair this Guaranty.

                  (b) GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY OR RELATING
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS GUARANTY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUARANTOR
AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS
GUARANTY, AND THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN
THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT
HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL.

         10. Interpretation. The section headings in this Guaranty are for the
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or construction
of any provision hereof.

         11. Notices. All notices or other communications required or permitted
to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be considered as properly
given (a) if delivered in person, (b) if

if transmitted before 4:00 p.m., recipient's time, and if transmitted after that
time, on the next following Banking Day; provided, however, that if any notice
is tendered to an addressee and the delivery thereof is refused by such

similar form of mail, addressed to Guarantor as provided for notices hereunder.

                  (b) This Guaranty and the rights and obligations of
Administrative Agent and of Guarantor shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of New York without reference to principles
of conflicts of laws (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General
Obligations Law).

all other payments of any kind under any leases now existing or hereafter

assignment as security for the performance of the obligations under the Credit
Documents, or any other indebtedness. Subject to the provisions of herein below,
Beneficiary shall have the right, power and authority to: notify any person that
the Leases have been assigned to Beneficiary and


                                        6

whether or not Beneficiary has commenced or completed foreclosure or taken
possession of the Premises; settle compromise, release, extend the time of

obligations under the Leases; enforce payment of rents and other rights under
the Leases, prosecute any action or proceeding , and defend against any claim

the obligation, to use and apply all rents received hereunder in such order and
such manner as Beneficiary may determine in accordance with the Credit
Agreement. Notwithstanding that this is an absolute assignment of the rents and
Leases and not merely the collateral assignment of, or the grant of a lien or
security interest in the rents and Leases, Beneficiary grants to Trustor a
revocable license to collect and receive the rents and to retain, use and enjoy
such rents. Such license may be revoked by Beneficiary only upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default. Trustor shall apply any rents which it receives to the
payment due under the Secured Obligations, taxes, assessments, water charges,
sewer rents and other governmental charges levied, assessed or imposed against
the Premises, insurance premiums, and other obligations of lessor under the
Leases before using such proceeds for any other purpose. [UNLESS APPLICABLE (IN

or act on the part of Trustor or Beneficiary, become and be subject to the lien
and security interest of this Deed of Trust as fully and completely as though
specifically described herein, but nothing contained in this Section 2.10 shall
be deemed to modify or change the obligations of Trustor under Section 2.8
hereof. If and whenever from time to time Trustor shall hereafter acquire any
real property or interest therein which constitutes or is intended to constitute
part of the Trust Estate hereunder, Trustor shall promptly give notice thereof
to Beneficiary and Trustor shall forthwith execute, acknowledge and deliver to
Beneficiary a supplement to this Deed of Trust in form and substance reasonably

         TRUSTOR A PETITION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY LAW, AND TRUSTOR, AS LESSEE
         UNDER THE GROUND LEASE, SHALL DETERMINE TO REJECT THE GROUND LEASE
         PURSUANT TO SECTION 365(a) OF THE BANKRUPTCY LAW, THEN TRUSTOR SHALL

         DEFAULT EVEN THOUGH THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH DEFAULT OR THE NATURE THEREOF
         SHALL BE QUESTIONED OR DENIED BY TRUSTOR OR BY ANY PERSON ON ITS
         BEHALF.]

         2.12 Power of Attorney. Trustor does hereby irrevocably constitute and
appoint Beneficiary, its true and lawful attorney (which appointment is coupled
with an interest), with full power of substitution, for Trustor and in the name,
place and stead of Trustor or in Beneficiary's own name, for so long as any of
the Secured Obligations are outstanding, to ask, demand, collect, receive,
receipt for and sue for any and all rents, income and other sums which are
assigned hereunder with full power to endorse the name of Trustor on all
instruments given in payment or in part payment thereof, to settle, adjust or
compromise any claims thereunder as fully as Trustor itself could do and in its
discretion file any claim or take any action or proceeding, either in its own
name or in the name of Trustor or otherwise, which Beneficiary may deem
necessary or appropriate to protect and preserve the right, title and interest
of Beneficiary in and to such rents, income and


                                       11

<PAGE>



other sums and the security intended to be afforded hereby; provided that
Beneficiary shall not exercise such rights unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

         2.13 Covenant to Pay. If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and such Event of Default could reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect Beneficiary's interest hereunder in the Trust Estate or
result in personal injury, then Beneficiary, among its other rights and
remedies, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay, observe or
perform the same, in whole or in part, and with such modifications as
Beneficiary reasonably shall deem advisable. To the extent provided in the
Credit Documents, all sums, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys
fees, so expended or incurred by Beneficiary by reason of the default of
Trustor, or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Trustor, as well as,
without limitation, sums expended or incurred to sustain the lien or estate of
this Deed of Trust or its priority, or to protect or enforce any rights of
Beneficiary hereunder, or to recover any of the Secured Obligations, or to
complete construction of the Project for which the Credit Documents are intended
as financing, or for repairs, maintenance, alterations, replacements or
improvements thereto or for the protection thereof, or for real estate taxes or
other governmental assessments or charges against any part of the Trust Estate,
or premiums for insurance of the Trust Estate, shall be entitled to the benefit
of the lien on the Trust Estate as of the date of the recording of this Deed of
Trust, shall be deemed to be added to and be part of the Secured Obligations
secured hereby, whether or not the result thereof causes the total amount of the
Secured Obligations to exceed the stated amount set forth in the second
introductory paragraph of this Deed of Trust, and shall be repaid by Trustor as
provided in the Credit Documents.

         2.14 Security Agreement.

                  2.14.1 This Deed of Trust shall also be a security agreement
between Trustor and Beneficiary covering the Deed of Trust Property constituting
personal property or fixtures (hereinafter collectively called "UCC Collateral")
governed by the [RELEVANT STATE] Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") as the same may
be more specifically set forth in any financing statement delivered in
connection with this Deed of Trust, and as further security for the payment and
performance of the Secured Obligations, Trustor hereby grants to Beneficiary a
security interest in such portion of the Site to the full extent that the Site
may be subject to the UCC. In addition to Beneficiary's other rights hereunder,
Beneficiary shall have all rights of a secured party under the UCC. Trustor
shall execute and deliver to Beneficiary all financing statements and such
further assurances that may be reasonably required by Beneficiary to establish,
create, perfect (to the extent the same can be achieved by the filing of a
financing statement) and maintain the validity and priority of Beneficiary's
security interests, and Trustor shall bear all reasonable costs thereof,
including all UCC searches. Except as otherwise provided in the Credit
Documents, if Beneficiary should dispose of any of the Site comprising the UCC
Collateral pursuant to the UCC, ten (10) days' prior written notice by
Beneficiary to Trustor shall be deemed to be reasonable notice; provided,
however, Beneficiary may dispose of such property in accordance with the
foreclosure procedures of this Deed of Trust in lieu of proceeding under the
UCC. Beneficiary may from time to time execute and deliver at Trustor's expense,
all continuation statements, termination statements, amendments, partial
releases, or other instruments relating to all financing statements by and
between Trustor and Beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided in the Credit
Documents, if an Event of Default shall occur and is continuing, (a)
Beneficiary, in addition to any other rights


                                       12

<PAGE>



and remedies which it may have, may exercise immediately and without demand to
the extent permitted by law, any and all rights and remedies granted to a
secured party under the UCC including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the right to take possession of the UCC Collateral or any part
thereof, and to take such other measures as Beneficiary may deem necessary for
the care, protection and preservation of such collateral and (b) upon request or
demand of Beneficiary, Trustor shall at its expense, assemble the UCC Collateral
and make it available to Beneficiary at a convenient place acceptable to
Beneficiary. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary on demand, any and all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred or paid by
Beneficiary in protecting the interest in the UCC Collateral and in enforcing
the rights hereunder with respect to such UCC Collateral.

                  2.14.2 Trustor and the Beneficiary agree, to the extent
permitted by law, that: (i) this Deed of Trust upon recording or registration in
the real estate records of the proper office shall constitute a financing
statement filed as a "fixture filing" within the meaning of [SECTIONS 9-313 AND
9-402 OF THE UCC]; (ii) all or a part of the Trust Estate are or are to become
fixtures; and (iii) the addresses of Trustor and Beneficiary are as set forth on
the first page of this Deed of Trust.

                              ARTICLE 3 - REMEDIES

         3.1 Acceleration of Maturity. If an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, Beneficiary may (except that such acceleration shall be automatic if
the Event of Default is caused by a Bankruptcy Event of Trustor), declare the
Secured Obligations to be due and payable immediately, and upon such declaration
such principal and interest and other sums shall immediately become due and
payable without demand, presentment, notice or other requirements of any kind
(all of which Trustor waives).

         3.2 Protective Advances If an Event of Default shall have occurred and
is continuing, then without thereby limiting Beneficiary's other rights or
remedies, waiving or releasing any of Trustor's obligations, or imposing any
obligation on Beneficiary, Beneficiary may either advance any amount owing or
perform any or all actions that Beneficiary considers necessary or appropriate
to cure such default. All such advances shall constitute "Protective Advances."
No sums advanced or performance rendered by Beneficiary shall cure, or be deemed
a waiver of any Event of Default.

         3.3 Institution of Equity Proceedings. If an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, Beneficiary may institute an action, suit or proceeding in
equity for specific performance of this Deed of Trust, the Guaranty or any other
Credit Document, all of which shall be specifically enforceable by injunction or
other equitable remedy.

         3.4 Beneficiary's Power of Enforcement.

                  (a) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
Beneficiary shall be entitled, at its option and in its sole and absolute
discretion, to prepare and record on its own behalf, or to deliver to Trustee
for recording, if appropriate, written declaration of default and demand for
sale and written Notice of Breach and Election to Sell (or other statutory
notice) to cause the Trust Estate to be sold to satisfy the obligations hereof,
and in the case of delivery to Trustee, Trustee shall cause said notice to be
filed for record.


                                       13

<PAGE>



                  (b) After the lapse of such time as may then be required by
law following the recordation of said Notice of Breach and Election to Sell, and
notice of sale having been given as then required by law, Trustee without demand
on Trustor, shall sell the Trust Estate or any portion thereof at the time and
place fixed by it in said notice, either as a whole or in separate parcels, and
in such order as it may determine, at public auction to the highest bidder, of
cash in lawful money of the United States payable at the time of sale. Trustee
may, for any cause it deems expedient, postpone the sale of all or any portion
of said property until it shall be completed and, in every case, notice of
postponement shall be given by public announcement thereof at the time and place
last appointed for the sale and from time to time thereafter Trustee may
postpone such sale by public announcement at the time fixed by the preceding
postponement; provided that Trustee shall give Trustor notice of such
postponement to the extent required by law. Trustee shall execute and deliver to
the purchaser its Deed, Bill of Sale, or other instrument conveying said
property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or implied. The
recitals in such instrument of conveyance of any matters or facts shall be
conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person, including Beneficiary,
may bid at the sale.

                  (c) After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Trustee
and of this Deed of Trust, including, without limitation, costs of evidence of
title and reasonable attorneys' fees of Trustee or Beneficiary in connection
with a sale, Trustee shall apply the proceeds of such sale to payment of all
sums expended under the terms hereof not then repaid, with accrued interest at
the interest rate on the Notes then to the payment of all other sums then
secured hereby and the remainder, if any, to the person or persons legally
entitled thereto.

                  (d) If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
Beneficiary may, either with or without entry or taking possession of the Trust
Estate, and without regard to whether or not the indebtedness and other sums
secured hereby shall be due and without prejudice to the right of Beneficiary
thereafter to bring an action or proceeding to foreclose or any other action for
any default existing at the time such earlier action was commenced, proceed by
any appropriate action or proceeding: (1) to enforce payment of the Secured
Obligations, to the extent permitted by law, or the performance of any term
hereof or any other right; (2) to foreclose this Deed of Trust in any manner
provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages or deeds of trust on real
property and to sell, as an entirety or in separate lots or parcels, the Trust
Estate or any portion thereof pursuant to the laws of the [RELEVANT STATE] or
under the judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction, and
Beneficiary shall be entitled to recover in any such proceeding all costs and
expenses incident thereto, including reasonable attorneys' fees in such amount
as shall be awarded by the court; (3) to exercise any or all of the rights and
remedies available to it under the Credit Documents; and (4) to pursue any other
remedy available to it. Beneficiary shall take action either by such proceedings
or by the exercise of its powers with respect to entry or taking possession, or
both, as Beneficiary may determine.

                  (e) The remedies described in this Section 3.4 may be
exercised with respect to all or any portion of the Tangible Collateral, either
simultaneously with the sale of any real


                                       14

<PAGE>



property encumbered hereby or independent thereof. Beneficiary shall at any time
be permitted to proceed with respect to all or any portion of the Tangible
Collateral in any manner permitted by the UCC. Trustor agrees that Beneficiary's
inclusion of all or any portion of the Tangible Collateral in a sale or other
remedy exercised with respect to the real property encumbered hereby, as
permitted by the UCC, is a commercially reasonable disposition of such property.

         3.5 Beneficiary's Right to Enter and Take Possession, Operate and
Apply Income.

                  (a) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, Trustor,
upon demand of Beneficiary, shall forthwith surrender to Beneficiary the actual
possession and, if and to the extent permitted by law, Beneficiary itself, or by
such officers or agents as it may appoint, may enter and take possession of all
the Trust Estate including the Tangible Collateral, without liability for
trespass, damages or otherwise, and may exclude Trustor and its agents and
employees wholly therefrom and may have joint access with Trustor to the books,
papers and accounts of Trustor.

                  (b) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
Trustor shall for any reason fail to surrender or deliver the Trust Estate, the
Tangible Collateral or any part thereof after Beneficiary's demand, Beneficiary
may obtain a judgment or decree conferring on Beneficiary or Trustee the right
to immediate possession or requiring Trustor to deliver immediate possession of
all or part of such property to Beneficiary or Trustee and Trustor hereby
specifically consents to the entry of such judgment or decree. Trustor shall pay
to Beneficiary or Trustee, upon demand, all costs and expenses of obtaining such
judgment or decree and reasonable compensation to Beneficiary or Trustee, their
attorneys and agents, and all such costs, expenses and compensation shall, until
paid, be secured by the lien of this Deed of Trust.

                  (c) Upon every such entering upon or taking of possession,
Beneficiary or Trustee may hold, store, use, operate, manage and control the
Trust Estate and conduct the business thereof, and, from time to time in its
sole and absolute discretion and without being under any duty to so act:

                           (1) make all necessary and proper maintenance,
repairs, renewals and replacements thereto and thereon, and all necessary
additions, betterments and improvements thereto and thereon and purchase or
otherwise acquire fixtures, personalty and other property in connection
therewith;

                           (2) insure or keep the Trust Estate insured;

                           (3) manage and operate the Trust Estate and exercise
all the rights and powers of Trustor in their name or otherwise with respect to
the same;

                           (4) enter into agreements with others to exercise the
powers herein granted Beneficiary or Trustee, all as Beneficiary or Trustee from
time to time may determine; and shall apply the monies so received by
Beneficiary or Trustee in such priority as provided by the Credit Documents to
(1) the payment of interest and principal due and payable to the Beneficiary,
(2) the


                                       15

<PAGE>



deposits for taxes and assessments and insurance premiums due, (3) the cost of
insurance, taxes, assessments and other proper charges upon the Trust Estate or
any part thereof; (4) the compensation, expenses and disbursements of the
agents, attorneys and other representatives of Beneficiary or Trustee as allowed
under this Deed of Trust; and (5) any other charges or costs required to be paid
by Trustor under the terms of the Credit Documents.

                           (5) rent or sublet the Trust Estate or any portion
thereof for any purpose permitted by this Deed of Trust.

                  Beneficiary or Trustee shall surrender possession of the Trust
Estate and the Tangible Collateral to Trustor (i) as may be required by law or
court order, or (ii) when all amounts under any of the terms of the Credit
Documents, including this Deed of Trust, shall have been paid current and all
Events of Default have been cured or waived. The same right of taking
possession, however, shall exist if any subsequent Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing.

         3.6 Separate Sales. To the extent permitted by law or Governmental
Rule, the Trust Estate may be sold in one or more parcels and in such manner and
order as Trustee, in his sole discretion, may elect, it being expressly
understood and agreed that the right of sale arising out of any Event of Default
shall not be exhausted by any one or more sales.

         3.7 Waiver of Appraisement, Valuation, Stay, Extension and Redemption
Laws. Trustor agrees to the full extent permitted by law that if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, neither Trustor nor anyone claiming through or
under it shall or will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any
appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption laws now or hereafter in
force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Deed
of Trust or the absolute sale of the Trust Estate or any portion thereof or the
final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale,
of the purchasers thereof, and Trustor for itself and all who may at any time
claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may
lawfully so do, the benefit of all such laws, and any and all right to have the
assets comprising the Trust Estate marshalled upon any foreclosure of the lien
hereof and agrees that Trustee or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose
such lien may sell the Trust Estate in part or as an entirety.

         3.8 Receiver. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law, and without regard to the value,
adequacy or occupancy of the security for the indebtedness and other sums
secured hereby, shall be entitled as a matter of right if it so elects to the
appointment of a receiver to enter upon and take possession of the Trust Estate
and to collect all earnings, revenues and receipts and apply the same as the
court may direct, and such receiver may be appointed by any court of competent
jurisdiction upon application by Beneficiary. To the extent permitted by law or
Governmental Rule, Beneficiary may have a receiver appointed without notice to
Trustor or any third party, and Beneficiary may waive any requirement that the
receiver post a bond. To the extent permitted by law or Governmental Rule,
Beneficiary shall have the power to designate and select the Person who shall
serve as the receiver and to negotiate all terms and conditions under which such
receiver shall serve. To the extent permitted by law or Governmental Rule, any
receiver appointed on Beneficiary's behalf may be an Affiliate of Beneficiary.
The reasonable expenses, including receiver's fees, reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs and agent's


                                       16

<PAGE>



compensation, incurred pursuant to the powers herein contained shall be secured
by this Deed of Trust. The right to enter and take possession of and to manage
and operate the Trust Estate and to collect all earnings, revenues and receipts,
whether by a receiver or otherwise, shall be cumulative to any other right or
remedy available to Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust, the other Credit
Documents or otherwise available to Beneficiary and may be exercised
concurrently therewith or independently thereof, but such rights shall be
exercised in a manner which is otherwise in accordance with and consistent with
the Credit Documents. Beneficiary shall be liable to account only for such
earnings, revenues and receipts (including, without limitation, security
deposits) actually received by Beneficiary, whether received pursuant to this
section or any other provision hereof. Notwithstanding the appointment of any
receiver or other custodian, Beneficiary shall be entitled as pledgee to the
possession and control of any cash, deposits, or instruments at the time held
by, or payable or deliverable under the terms of this Deed of Trust to,
Beneficiary.

         3.9 Suits to Protect the Trust Estate. Beneficiary shall have the power
and authority to institute and maintain any suits and proceedings as
Beneficiary, in its sole and absolute discretion, may deem advisable (a) to
prevent any impairment of the Trust Estate by any acts which may be unlawful or
in violation of this Deed of Trust, (b) to preserve or protect its interest in
the Trust Estate, or (c) to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any
legislation or other Legal Requirement that may be unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid, if the enforcement of or compliance with such enactment, rule or order
might impair the security hereunder or be prejudicial to Beneficiary's interest.

         3.10 Proofs of Claim. In the case of any receivership, insolvency,
Bankruptcy Event, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceedings affecting Trustor, any Affiliate or any guarantor, co-maker
or endorser of any of Trustor's obligations, its creditors or its property,
Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to file such
proofs of claim or other documents as it may deem be necessary or advisable in
order to have its claims allowed in such proceedings for the entire amount due
and payable by Trustor under the Credit Documents, at the date of the
institution of such proceedings, and for any additional amounts which may become
due and payable by Trustor after such date.

         3.11 Trustor to Pay Amounts Secured Hereby on Any Default in Payment;
Application of Monies by Beneficiary.

                  (a) In case of a foreclosure sale of all or any part of the
Trust Estate and of the application of the proceeds of sale to the payment of
the sums secured hereby, to the extent permitted by law, Beneficiary shall be
entitled to enforce payment from Trustor of any additional amounts then
remaining due and unpaid and to recover judgment against Trustor for any portion
thereof remaining unpaid , with interest at the interest rate on the Notes.

                  (b) Trustor hereby agrees to the extent permitted by law, that
no recovery of any such judgment by Beneficiary or other action by Beneficiary
and no attachment or levy of any execution upon any of the Trust Estate or any
other property shall in any way affect the Lien and security interest of this
Deed of Trust upon the Trust Estate or any part thereof or any Lien, rights,
powers or remedies of Beneficiary hereunder, but such Lien, rights, powers and
remedies shall continue unimpaired as before.


                                       17

<PAGE>



                  (c) Any monies collected or received by Beneficiary under this
Section 3.11 shall be first applied to the payment of compensation, expenses and
disbursements of the agents, attorneys and other representatives of Beneficiary,
and the balance remaining shall be applied to the payment of amounts due and
unpaid under the Credit Documents.

         3.12 Delay or Omission; No Waiver. No delay or omission of Beneficiary
or the Banks to exercise any right, power or remedy upon any Event of Default
shall exhaust or impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to
waive any such Event of Default or to constitute acquiescence therein. Every
right, power and remedy given to Beneficiary whether contained herein or in the
other Credit Documents or otherwise available to Beneficiary may be exercised
from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by Beneficiary.

         3.13 No Waiver of One Default to Affect Another. No waiver of any Event
of Default hereunder shall extend to or affect any subsequent or any other Event
of Default then existing, or impair any rights, powers or remedies consequent
thereon. If Beneficiary (a) grants forbearance or an extension of time for the
payment of any sums secured hereby; (b) takes other or additional security for
the payment thereof; (c) waives or does not exercise any right granted in this
Deed of Trust or any other Credit Document; (d) releases any part of the Trust
Estate from the lien or security interest of this Deed of Trust or any other
instrument securing the Secured Obligations; (e) consents to the filing of any
map, plat or replat of the [LEASED] Premises; (f) consents to the granting of
any easement on the [LEASED] Premises; or (g) makes or consents to any agreement
changing the terms of this Deed of Trust or any other Credit Document
subordinating the lien or any charge hereof, no such act or omission shall
release, discharge, modify, change or affect the liability under this Deed of
Trust or any other Credit Document or otherwise of Trustor, or any subsequent
purchaser of the Trust Estate or any part thereof or any maker, co-signer,
surety or guarantor with respect to any other matters not addressed by such act
or omission. No such act or omission shall preclude Beneficiary from exercising
any right, power or privilege herein granted or intended to be granted in case
of any Event of Default then existing or of any subsequent Event of Default,
nor, except as otherwise expressly provided in an instrument or instruments
executed by Beneficiary, shall the lien or security interest of this Deed of
Trust be altered thereby, except to the extent expressly provided in such acts
or omissions. In the event of the sale or transfer by operation of law or
otherwise of all or any part of the Trust Estate, Beneficiary, without notice to
any person, firm or corporation, is hereby authorized and empowered to deal with
any such vendee or transferee with reference to the Trust Estate or the
indebtedness secured hereby, or with reference to any of the terms or conditions
hereof, as fully and to the same extent as it might deal with the original
parties hereto and without in any way releasing or discharging any of the
liabilities or undertakings hereunder, or waiving its right to declare such sale
or transfer an Event of Default as provided herein. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Deed of Trust or any other Credit Document, (i)
in the case of any non-monetary Event of Default, Beneficiary may continue to
accept payments due hereunder without thereby waiving the existence of such or
any other Event of Default and (ii) in the case of any monetary Event of
Default, Beneficiary may accept partial payments of any sums due hereunder
without thereby waiving the existence of such Event of Default if the partial
payment is not sufficient to completely cure such Event of Default.

         3.14 Discontinuance of Proceedings; Position of Parties Restored. If
Beneficiary shall have proceeded to enforce any right or remedy under this Deed
of Trust by foreclosure, entry of judgement or otherwise and such proceedings
shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or such proceedings
shall have resulted in a final determination adverse to Beneficiary, then and in
every such case Trustor and Beneficiary shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, powers and remedies of
Beneficiary shall continue as if no such proceedings had occurred or had been
taken.

         3.15 Remedies Cumulative. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.15
hereof, no right, power or remedy, including without limitation remedies with
respect to any security for the Secured Obligations, conferred upon or reserved
to Beneficiary by this Deed of Trust or any other Credit Document is exclusive
of any other right, power or remedy, but each and every such right, power and
remedy shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to any other
right, power and remedy given hereunder or under any other Credit Document, now
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and Beneficiary shall be
entitled to resort to such rights, powers, remedies or security as Beneficiary
shall in its sole and absolute discretion deem advisable.

         3.16 Interest After Event of Default. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing, all sums outstanding and unpaid under the Credit
Documents, including this Deed of Trust, shall, at Beneficiary's option, bear
interest at the interest rate on the Notes until such Event of Default has been
cured. Trustor's obligation to pay such interest shall be secured by this Deed
of Trust.

         3.17 Foreclosure; Expenses of Litigation. If Trustee forecloses,
reasonable attorneys' fees for services in the supervision of said foreclosure
proceeding shall be allowed to the Trustee and Beneficiary as part of the
foreclosure costs. In the event of foreclosure of the lien hereof, there shall
be allowed and included as additional indebtedness all reasonable expenditures
and expenses which may be paid or incurred by or on behalf of Beneficiary for
attorneys' fees, appraiser's fees, outlays for documentary and expert evidence,
stenographers' charges, publication costs, and costs (which may be estimated as
to items to be expended after foreclosure sale or entry of the decree) of
procuring all such abstracts of title, title searches and examinations, title
insurance policies and guarantees, and similar data and assurances with respect
to title as Beneficiary may deem reasonably necessary either to prosecute such
suit or to evidence to a bidder at any sale which may be had pursuant to such
decree the true condition of the title to or the value of the Trust Estate or
any portion thereof. All expenditures and expenses of the nature in this section
mentioned, and such expenses and fees as may be incurred in the protection of
the Trust Estate and the maintenance of the lien and security interest of this
Deed of Trust, including the reasonable fees of any attorney employed by
Beneficiary in any litigation or proceeding affecting this Deed of Trust or any
other Credit Document, the Trust Estate or any portion thereof, including,
without limitation, civil, probate, appellate and bankruptcy proceedings, or in
preparation for the commencement or defense of any proceeding or threatened suit
or proceeding, shall be immediately due and payable by Trustor, with interest
thereon at the interest rate on the Notes, and shall be secured by this Deed of
Trust. Trustee waives its right to any statutory fee in connection with any
judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of the lien hereof and agrees to accept a
reasonable fee for such services.

         3.18 Deficiency Judgments Recourse against Trustor, the other Portfolio
Entities, any Partner and their respective Affiliates, members, partners,
stockholders, officers, directors and employees under this Deed of Trust shall
be limited to the extent provided in Article 9 of the Credit Agreement. Subject
to Article 9 of the Credit Agreement, if after foreclosure of this Deed of Trust
or Trustee's sale hereunder, there shall remain any deficiency with respect to
any amounts payable under the Credit Documents, including hereunder, or any
amounts secured hereby, and Beneficiary shall institute any proceedings to
recover such deficiency or deficiencies, all such amounts shall continue to bear
interest at the interest rate on the Notes. Subject to Article 9 of the Credit
Agreement, Trustor waives any defense to Beneficiary's recovery against Trustor
of any deficiency after any foreclosure sale of the Trust Estate. Subject to
Article 9 of the Credit Agreement, to the extent permitted by law, Trustor
expressly waives any defense or benefits that may be derived from any statute
granting Trustor any defense to any such recovery by Beneficiary. Subject to
Article 9 of the Credit Agreement, in addition, Beneficiary and Trustee shall be
entitled to recovery of all of their reasonable costs and expenditures
(including without limitation any court imposed costs) in connection with such
proceedings, including their reasonable attorneys' fees, appraisal fees and the
other costs, fees and expenditures referred to in Section 3.17 above. This
provision shall survive any foreclosure or sale of the Trust Estate, any portion
thereof and/or the extinguishment of the lien hereof.

         3.19 Waiver of Jury Trial. Beneficiary and Trustor each waive any right
to have a jury participate in resolving any dispute whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise arising out of, connected with, related to or
incidental to the relationship established between them in connection with this
Deed of Trust, the Guaranty or any other Credit Document. Any such disputes
shall be resolved in a bench trial without a jury.

         3.20 Exculpation of Beneficiary. The acceptance by Beneficiary of the
assignment contained herein with all of the rights, powers, privileges and
authority created hereby shall not, prior to entry upon and taking possession of
the Trust Estate by Beneficiary, be deemed or construed to make Beneficiary a
"mortgagee in possession"; nor thereafter or at any time or in any event
obligate Beneficiary to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to
the Trust Estate, nor shall Beneficiary, prior to such entry and taking, be
liable in any way for any injury or damage to person or property sustained by
any Person in or about the Trust Estate.

              ARTICLE 4 - RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF TRUSTEE;
                      OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO TRUSTEE

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Deed of Trust, Trustor
and Beneficiary agree as follows.

         4.1 Exercise of Remedies by Trustee To the extent that this Deed of
Trust or applicable law authorizes or empowers Beneficiary to exercise any
remedies set forth in Article Three hereof or otherwise, or perform any acts in
connection therewith, Trustee (but not to the exclusion of Beneficiary unless so
required under the law of the State of [RELEVANT STATE]) shall have the power to
exercise any or all such remedies, and to perform any acts provided for in this
Deed of Trust in connection therewith, all for the benefit of Beneficiary and on
Beneficiary's behalf in accordance with applicable law of the State of [RELEVANT
STATE]. In connection therewith,


                                       20

<PAGE>



Trustee: (a) shall not exercise, or waive the exercise of, any Beneficiary's
Remedies (other than any rights or Trustee to any indemnity or reimbursement),
except at Beneficiary's request, and (b) shall exercise, or waive the exercise
of, any or all of Beneficiary's remedies at Beneficiary's request, and in
accordance with Beneficiary's directions as to the manner of such exercise or
waiver. Trustee may, however, decline to follow Beneficiary's request or
direction if Trustee shall be advised by counsel that the action or proceeding,
or manner thereof, so directed may not lawfully be taken or waived.

         4.2 Rights and Privileges of Trustee. To the extent that this Deed of
Trust requires Trustor to reimburse Beneficiary for any expenditures Beneficiary
may incur, Trustee shall be entitled to the same rights to reimbursement of
expenses as Beneficiary, subject to such limitations and conditions as would
apply in the case of Beneficiary. To the extent that this Deed of Trust negates
or limits Beneficiary's liability as to any matter, Trustee shall be entitled to
the same negation or limitation of liability. To the extent that Trustor,
pursuant to this Deed of Trust, appoints Beneficiary as Trustor's attorney in
fact for any purpose, Beneficiary or (when so instructed by Beneficiary) Trustee
shall be entitled to act on Trustor's behalf without joinder or confirmation by
the other.

         4.3 Resignation or Replacement of Trustee Trustee may resign by an
instrument in writing addressed to Beneficiary, and Trustee may be removed at
any time with or without cause (i.e., in Beneficiary's sole and absolute
discretion) by an instrument in writing executed by Beneficiary. In case of the
death, resignation, removal or disqualification of Trustee or if for any reason
Beneficiary shall deem it desirable to appoint a substitute, successor or
replacement Trustee to act instead of Trustee originally named (or in place of
any substitute, successor or replacement Trustee), then Beneficiary shall have
the right and is hereby authorized and empowered to appoint a successor,
substitute or replacement Trustee, and, if preferred, several substitute
trustees in succession, without any formality other than appointment and
designation in writing executed by Beneficiary, which instrument shall be
recorded if required by the law of the State of [RELEVANT STATE]. The law of the
State of [RELEVANT STATE] shall govern the qualifications of any Trustee. The
authority conferred upon Trustee by this Deed of Trust shall automatically
extend to any and all other successor, substitute and replacement Trustee(s)
successively until the Secured Obligations have been paid in full or the Trust
Estate has been sold hereunder or released in accordance with the provisions of
the Credit Documents. Beneficiary's written appointment and designation of any
Trustee shall be full evidence of Beneficiary's right and authority to make the
same and of all facts therein recited. No confirmation, authorization, approval
or other action by Trustor shall be required in connection with any resignation
or other replacement of Trustee.

         4.4 Authority of Beneficiary. If Beneficiary is a banking corporation,
state banking corporation or a national banking association and the instrument
of appointment of any successor or replacement Trustee is executed on
Beneficiary's behalf by an officer of such corporation, state banking
corporation or national banking association, then such appointment may be
executed by any authorized officer or agent of Beneficiary and such appointment
shall be conclusively presumed to be executed with authority and shall be valid
and sufficient without proof of any action by the board of directors or any
superior officer of Beneficiary.


                                       21

<PAGE>



         4.5 Effect of Appointment of Successor Trustee. Upon the appointment
and designation of any successor, substitute or replacement Trustee, Trustee's
entire estate and title in the Trust Estate shall vest in the designated
successor, substitute or replacement Trustee. Such successor, substitute or
replacement Trustee shall thereupon succeed to and shall hold, possess and
execute all the rights, powers, privileges, immunities and duties herein
conferred upon Trustee. All references herein to Trustee shall be deemed to
refer to Trustee (including any successor or substitute appointed and designated
as herein provided) from time to time acting hereunder.

         4.6 Confirmation of Transfer and Succession. Any new Trustee appointed
pursuant to any of the provisions hereof shall, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, become vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers and
trusts of his predecessor in the rights hereunder with like effect as if
originally named as Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written request
of Beneficiary or of any successor, substitute or replacement Trustee, any
former Trustee ceasing to act shall execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to such successor, substitute or replacement Trustee all of the
right, title, estate and interest in the Trust Estate of Trustee so ceasing to
act, together with all the rights, powers, privileges, immunities and duties
herein conferred upon Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all
properties and moneys held by said Trustee hereunder to said successor,
substitute or replacement Trustee.

         4.7 Exculpation. Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment
or act done by Trustee in good faith, or otherwise be responsible or accountable
under any circumstances whatsoever, except for Trustee's gross negligence,
willful misconduct or knowing violation of law. Trustee shall not be personally
liable in case of entry by him, or anyone entering by virtue of the powers
herein granted him, upon the Trust Estate for debts contracted or liability or
damages incurred in the management or operation of the Trust Estate. Trustee
shall have the right to rely on any instrument, document or signature
authorizing or supporting any action taken or proposed to be taken by it
hereunder, believed by it in good faith to be genuine. All moneys received by
Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for
the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated in any
manner from any other moneys (except to the extent required by law). Trustee
shall be under no liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder.

         4.8 Endorsement and Execution of Documents. Upon Beneficiary's written
request, Trustee shall, without liability or notice to Trustor, execute, consent
to, or join in any instrument or agreement in connection with or necessary to
effectuate the purposes of the Credit Documents. Trustor hereby irrevocably
designates Trustee as its attorney in fact to execute, acknowledge and deliver,
on Trustor's behalf and in Trustor's name, all instruments or agreements
necessary to implement any provision(s) of this Deed of Trust or to further
perfect the lien created by this Deed of Trust on the Trust Estate. This power
of attorney shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and shall survive any
disability of Trustor.

         4.9 Multiple Trustees. If Beneficiary appoints multiple trustees, then
any Trustee, individually, may exercise all powers granted to Trustee under this
instrument, without the need for action by any other Trustee(s).


                                       22

<PAGE>



         4.10 No Required Action. Trustee shall not be required to take any
action under this Deed of Trust or to institute, appear in or defend any action,
suit or other proceeding in connection therewith where in his opinion such
action will be likely to involve him in expense or liability, unless requested
so to do by a written instrument signed by Beneficiary and, if Trustee so
requests, unless Trustee is tendered security and indemnity satisfactory to him
against any and all costs, expense and liabilities arising therefrom. Trustee
shall not be responsible for the execution, acknowledgment or validity of the
Credit Documents, or for the proper authorization thereof, or for the
sufficiency of the lien and security interest purported to be created hereby,
and makes no representation in respect thereof or in respect of the rights,
remedies and recourses of Beneficiary.

         4.11 Terms of Trustee's Acceptance. Trustee accepts the trust created
by this Deed of Trust upon the following terms and conditions:

                  (a) DELEGATION. Trustee may exercise any of its powers through
appointment of attorney(s) in fact or agents.

                  (b) SECURITY. Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any
action upon any Event of Default unless furnished security or indemnity, in form
satisfactory to Trustee, against costs, expenses, and liabilities that Trustee
may incur.

                  (c) COSTS AND EXPENSES. Trustor shall reimburse Trustee, as
part of the Secured Obligations secured hereunder, for all reasonable
disbursements and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by reason of or arising from an Event of Default and as provided for in
this Deed of Trust, including any of the foregoing incurred in Trustee's
administering and executing the trust created by this Deed of Trust and
performing Trustee's duties and exercising Trustee's powers under this Deed of
Trust.

                  (d) RELEASE. Upon payment of the Secured Obligations secured
hereunder, Beneficiary shall request Trustee to release this Deed of Trust and
shall surrender all the Secured Obligations secured hereunder to Trustee.
Trustee shall release this Deed of Trust without charge to Trustor. Trustor
shall pay all costs of recordation, if any.

                               ARTICLE 5 - GENERAL

         5.1 Discharge. When all of the Secured Obligations shall have been paid
in full, then this Deed of Trust and the lien and security interest created
hereby shall be of no further force and effect, Trustor shall be released from
the covenants, agreements and obligations of Trustor contained in this Deed of
Trust and all right, title and interest in and to the Trust Estate shall revert
to Trustor. Beneficiary and Trustee, at the request and the expense of Trustor,
shall promptly execute a deed of reconveyance and such other documents as may be
reasonably requested by Trustor to evidence the discharge and satisfaction of
this Deed of Trust and the release of Trustor from its obligations hereunder.

         5.2 No Waiver. The exercise of the privileges granted in this Deed of
Trust to perform Trustor's obligations under the agreements which constitute the
Trust Estate shall in no event be considered or constitute a waiver of any right
which Beneficiary may have at any time, after an


                                       23

<PAGE>



Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to declare the Secured
Obligations to be immediately due and payable. No delay or omission to exercise
any right, remedy or power accruing upon any default shall impair any such
right, remedy or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default
or acquiescence therein; and every such right, remedy and power may be exercised
from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

         5.3 Extension, Rearrangement or Renewal of Secured Obligations. It is
expressly agreed that any of the Secured Obligations at any time secured hereby
may be from time to time extended for any period, or with the consent of Trustor
rearranged or renewed, and that any part of the security herein described, or
any other security for the Secured Obligations, may be waived or released,
without altering, varying or diminishing the force, effect or lien or security
interest of this Deed of Trust; and the lien and security interest granted by
this Deed of Trust shall continue as a prior lien and security interest on all
of the Trust Estate not expressly so released, until the Secured Obligations are
fully paid and this Deed of Trust is terminated in accordance with the
provisions hereof; and no other security now existing or hereafter taken to
secure the payment of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof or the
performance of any obligation or liability of Trustor whatever shall in any
manner impair or affect the security given by this Deed of Trust; and all
security for the payment of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof and the
performance of any obligation or liability shall be taken, considered and held
as cumulative.

         5.4 Forcible Detainer. Trustor agrees for itself and all Persons
claiming by, through or under it, that subsequent to foreclosure hereunder in
accordance with this Deed of Trust and applicable law if Trustor shall hold
possession of the Trust Estate or any part thereof, Trustor or the Persons so
holding possession shall be guilty of trespass; and any such tenant failing or
refusing to surrender possession upon demand shall be guilty of forcible
detainer and shall be liable to such purchasers for reasonable rental on said
premises, and shall be subject to eviction and removal in accordance with law.

         5.5 Waiver of Stay or Extension. To the extent permitted to be waived
by law, Trustor shall not at any time insist upon or plead or in any manner
whatever claim the benefit or advantage of any stay, extension or moratorium law
now or at any time hereafter in force in any locality where the Trust Estate or
any part thereof may or shall be situated, nor shall Trustor claim any benefit
or advantage from any law now or hereafter in force providing for the valuation
or appraisement of the Trust Estate or any part thereof prior to any sale
thereof to be made pursuant to any provision of this Deed of Trust or to a
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, nor after any such sale shall
Trustor claim or exercise any right conferred by any law now or at any time
hereafter in force to redeem the Trust Estate so sold or any part thereof; and
Trustor hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law or laws
and the appraisement of the Trust Estate or any part thereof, and covenants that
Trustor shall not hinder or delay the execution of any power herein granted and
delegated to Beneficiary but that Trustor shall permit the execution of every
such power as though no such law had been made.

         5.6 Notices. Except where certified or registered mail notice is
required by applicable law, any notice to Trustor or Beneficiary required or
permitted hereunder shall be deemed to be given when given in the manner
prescribed in Section 12.1 of the Credit Agreement. All notices to


                                       24

<PAGE>



Trustee required or permitted hereunder shall be deemed given when given in the
manner prescribed in Section 12.1 of the Credit Agreement to the following
address:

                                [TRUSTEE ADDRESS]


         5.7 Severability. All rights, powers and remedies provided herein may
be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any
applicable law, and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that
they will not render this Deed of Trust invalid, unenforceable or not entitled
to be recorded, registered or filed under any applicable law. In the event any
term or provision contained in this Deed of Trust is in conflict, or may
hereafter be held to be in conflict, with the laws of [RELEVANT STATE] or of the
United States of America, this Deed of Trust shall be affected only as to such
particular term or provision, and shall in all other respects remain in full
force and effect.

         5.8 Application of Payments. In the event that any part of the Secured
Obligations cannot lawfully be secured hereby, or in the event that the lien and
security interest hereof cannot be lawfully enforced to pay any part of the
Secured Obligations, or in the event that the lien or security interest created
by this Deed of Trust shall be invalid or unenforceable as to any part of the
Secured Obligations, then all payments on the Secured Obligations shall be
deemed to have been first applied to the complete payment and liquidation of
that part of the Secured Obligations which is not secured by this Deed of Trust
and the unsecured portion of the Secured Obligations shall be completely paid
and liquidated prior to the payment and liquidation of the remaining secured
portion of the Secured Obligations.

         5.9 Governing Law

                  THIS DEED OF TRUST IS GOVERNED BY AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN

with the land and bind each of Trustor and Beneficiary and their respective

hereof on any part of the Trust Estate; provided that nothing in this Section
5.13 shall grant Beneficiary the right to alter or modify the Deed of Trust
without the consent of the Trustor unless otherwise specifically permitted in
this Deed of Trust.

         5.14 Future Advances. This Deed of Trust is executed and delivered to
secure, among other things, [ADD IF PROJECT OWNER IS NOT BORROWER: TRUSTOR'S

TRUSTOR'S GUARANTY OF] present and future advances made pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and that the lien of such future advances shall relate to the date of
this Deed of Trust. The advances are being used by Trustor to pay for all or
part of the cost of completing erection, acquisition, construction, alteration
or repair of any part of the Project, the financing of which, in whole or in
part, this Deed of Trust was given to secure.

         5.16 [SEVERABILITY AND COMPLIANCE WITH USURY LAW. THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS
ARE INTENDED TO BE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY, ALL APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL RULES AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. IF ANY
PROVISION OF ANY OF THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE APPLICATION THEREOF TO ANY
PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL, FOR ANY REASON AND TO ANY EXTENT, BE INVALID OR
UNENFORCEABLE, NEITHER THE REMAINDER OF THE INSTRUMENT IN WHICH SUCH PROVISION
IS CONTAINED, NOR THE APPLICATION OF SUCH PROVISION TO OTHER PERSONS OR
CIRCUMSTANCES, NOR THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS REFERRED TO HEREINABOVE, SHALL BE
AFFECTED THEREBY, BUT RATHER SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW. IT IS EXPRESSLY STIPULATED AND AGREED TO BE THE INTENT OF
TRUSTOR AND BENEFICIARY AT ALL TIMES TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE [RELEVANT
STATE] LAW GOVERNING THE MAXIMUM RATE OR AMOUNT OF INTEREST PAYABLE ON OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS (OR APPLICABLE UNITED STATES FEDERAL LAW
TO THE EXTENT THAT IT PERMITS BENEFICIARY TO CONTRACT FOR, CHARGE, TAKE, RESERVE
OR RECEIVE A GREATER AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAN UNDER [RELEVANT STATE] LAW). IF THE
APPLICABLE LAW IS EVER JUDICIALLY INTERPRETED SO AS TO RENDER USURIOUS ANY
AMOUNT CALLED FOR UNDER THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS, OR CONTRACTED FOR, CHARGED, TAKEN,

RESPECT TO THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT EVIDENCED BY THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR IF
ACCELERATION OF THE MATURITY OF THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS OR IF ANY PREPAYMENT BY
TRUSTOR RESULTS IN TRUSTOR HAVING PAID ANY INTEREST IN EXCESS OF THAT PERMITTED
BY LAW, THEN IT IS TRUSTOR'S AND BENEFICIARY'S EXPRESS INTENT THAT ALL EXCESS
AMOUNTS THERETOFORE COLLECTED BY BENEFICIARY BE CREDITED ON THE PRINCIPAL
BALANCE DUE UNDER THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS (OR, IF THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN OR
WOULD THEREBY BE PAID IN FULL, REFUNDED TO TRUSTOR), AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE
CREDIT DOCUMENTS IMMEDIATELY BE DEEMED REFORMED AND THE AMOUNTS THEREAFTER
COLLECTIBLE THEREUNDER REDUCED, WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF THE EXECUTION OF ANY
NEW DOCUMENT, SO AS TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE LAW, BUT SO AS TO PERMIT THE
RECOVERY OF THE FULLEST AMOUNT OTHERWISE CALLED FOR HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER.
THE RIGHT TO ACCELERATE MATURITY OF SECURED OBLIGATIONS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE
RIGHT TO ACCELERATE ANY INTEREST WHICH HAS NOT OTHERWISE ACCRUED ON THE DATE OF
SUCH ACCELERATION, AND BENEFICIARY DOES NOT INTEND TO COLLECT ANY UNEARNED
INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF ACCELERATION. ALL SUMS PAID OR AGREED TO BE PAID TO
BENEFICIARY FOR THE USE, FORBEARANCE OR DETENTION OF THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS
SHALL, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BE AMORTIZED, PRORATED,
ALLOCATED AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE FULL TERM OF THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS UNTIL
PAYMENT IN FULL SO THAT THE RATE OR AMOUNT OF INTEREST ON ACCOUNT OF THE SECURED
OBLIGATIONS DOES NOT EXCEED THE APPLICABLE USURY CEILING.]

TRUSTEE ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS DEED OF TRUST IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS OF THE GROUND LEASE. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS
OF THIS DEED OF TRUST AND THE GROUND LEASE, THE TERMS OF THE GROUND LEASE SHALL
SUPERSEDE AND CONTROL.]

         5.18 Release of Collateral.

                  (a) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, The
Trust Estate or any part thereof shall be released from the security interest
created by this Deed of Trust at any time or from time to time upon the request
of the Trustor; provided that the requirements of the Credit Documents have been
satisfied. Upon satisfaction of such requirements, a Responsible Officer of the
Beneficiary shall instruct the Trustee to promptly execute, deliver and
acknowledge any necessary or proper instruments of termination, satisfaction or
release to evidence the release of any Trust Estate permitted to be released

delivered, or concurrently with the delivery hereof, is delivering to
Administrative Agent an executed counterpart or certified copy of each of the

                                        8

<PAGE>



and to the parties to the Assigned Agreement or Assigned Agreements for which
Administrative Agent intends to remedy the default. After giving such notice of
its intent to cure such default and upon the commencement thereof,
Administrative Agent will proceed diligently to cure such default. Any cure by
Administrative Agent of Borrower's default under any of the Assigned Agreements
shall not be construed as an assumption by Administrative Agent or any of the
Banks of any obligations, covenants or agreements of Borrower under such
Assigned Agreement, and neither Administrative Agent nor any of the Banks shall
be liable to Borrower or any other Person as a result of any actions undertaken
by Administrative Agent in curing or attempting to cure any such default, except
as set forth in Section 12.13 of the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall not
be deemed to release or to affect in any way the obligations of Borrower under
the Assigned Agreements.

            2.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the
Collateral described in Section 2.1 shall not include, and the Lien granted
hereunder shall not extend to, any such Collateral relating to the Project

Project.

      3 OBLIGATIONS SECURED Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
this Agreement and all of the Collateral secure the payment and performance when
due of all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and the Banks (the "Obligations").

      4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BORROWER Borrower represents and
warrants as of the date hereof as follows:

            4.1 Borrower has not assigned any of its rights under the Assigned
Agreements except as provided in the Credit Documents.

            4.2 Borrower has not executed and is not aware of any effective
financing statement, security agreement or other instrument similar in effect
covering all or any part of the Collateral, except such as may have been filed
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents or pursuant to the
documents evidencing Permitted Liens.

            4.3 Except as permitted by the Credit Agreement, Borrower is
lawfully possessed of ownership of the Collateral and has full right, title and
interest in and to all rights purported to be granted to it under the Assigned
Agreements, not subject to any mortgages, liens, charges, or encumbrances except
Permitted Liens. Borrower has full power and lawful authority to grant and
assign the Collateral hereunder.

      5 COVENANTS OF BORROWER. Borrower covenants as follows:

            5.1 Any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement or any
Assigned Agreement may be taken by Administrative Agent either in Borrower's
name or in Administrative Agent's name, as Administrative Agent may deem
necessary.


                                        9

<PAGE>



            5.2 Borrower will, so long as any Obligations shall be outstanding,
warrant and defend its title to the Collateral and the interest of
Administrative Agent in the Collateral against any claim or demand of any
persons (other than Permitted Liens) which could reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect Borrower's title to, or Administrative Agent's right
or interest in, such Collateral.

            5.3 Borrower will at all times keep accurate and complete records of
the Collateral. Borrower shall permit representatives of Administrative Agent
upon reasonable prior notice, and in accordance with Section 5.6 of the Credit
Agreement, at any time during normal business hours of Borrower to inspect and
make abstracts from Borrower's books and records pertaining to the Collateral.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, at
Administrative Agent's request, Borrower shall promptly deliver copies of any
and all such records to Administrative Agent.

            5.4 Unless waived in writing by Administrative Agent, Borrower shall
give Administrative Agent at least 45 days' notice before it changes the
location of its principal place of business, chief executive office or state of
organization and shall at the expense of Borrower execute and deliver such
instruments and documents as may reasonably be required by Administrative Agent
to maintain a prior perfected security interest in the Collateral.

      6 EVENTS OF DEFAULT The occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit
Agreement, whatever the reason therefor and whether it shall be voluntary or
involuntary or be effected by operation of law, or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body, shall constitute an event of default
hereunder (an "Event of Default").

      7 REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT.

            7.1 If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Administrative Agent may (1) declare any amounts payable by Borrower under the
Credit Agreement to be due and payable immediately and thereupon the same shall
become immediately due and payable (provided that if such Event of Default
occurs under Section 8.1.4 of the Credit Agreement with respect to Borrower, all
such amounts shall become automatically due and payable); (2) proceed to protect
and enforce the rights vested in it by this Agreement, including but not limited
to, the right to cause all revenues pledged hereby as security and all other
moneys pledged hereunder to be paid directly to it, and to enforce its rights
hereunder to such payments and all other rights hereunder by such appropriate
judicial proceedings as it shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any
of such rights, either at law or in equity or otherwise, whether for specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in any of the Assigned
Agreements, or in aid of the exercise of any power therein or herein granted, or
for any foreclosure hereunder and sale under a judgment or decree in any
judicial proceeding, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in
it by this Agreement or by law; (3) cause any action at law or suit in equity or
other proceeding to be instituted and prosecuted to collect or enforce any
Obligations or rights hereunder or included in the Collateral, or to foreclose
or enforce any other agreement or other instrument by or under or pursuant to
which such Obligations are issued or secured, subject


                                       10

<PAGE>



in each case to the provisions and requirements thereof; (4) sell or otherwise
dispose of any or all of the Collateral or cause the Collateral to be sold or
otherwise disposed of in one or more sales or transactions, at such prices and
in such manner as Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable, and for
cash or on credit or for future delivery, without assumption of any credit risk
at any broker's board or at public or private sale, with or without a warranty
of title, without demand of performance or notice of intention to sell or of
time or place of sale (except such notice as is required by applicable statute
and cannot be waived), it being agreed that Administrative Agent may be a
purchaser on behalf of the Banks or on its own behalf at any such sale and that
Administrative Agent, any Bank, or any other Person who may be a bona fide
purchaser for value and without notice of any claims of any or all of the
Collateral so sold shall thereafter hold the same absolutely free from any claim
or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption, of Borrower,
any such demand, notice or right and equity being hereby expressly waived and
released to the extent permitted by law; (5) incur reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable consultants' fees, and other
costs appropriate to the exercise of any right or power under this Agreement;
(6) perform any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit
Document, and make payments, purchase, contest or compromise any encumbrance,
charge or lien, and pay taxes and expenses without, however, any obligation to
do so; (7) in connection with any acceleration and foreclosure, take possession
of the Collateral and render it usable and repair and renovate the same without,
however, any obligation to do so, and enter upon any Site or any other location
where the same may be located for that purpose, control, manage, operate, rent
and lease the Collateral, either separately or in conjunction with any Project,
collect all rents and income from the Collateral and apply the same to reimburse
the Banks for any cost or expenses incurred hereunder or under any of the Credit
Documents and to the payment or performance of Borrower's obligations hereunder
or under any of the Credit Documents, and apply the balance to the Loans of
Borrower as provided for in the Credit Agreement and any remaining excess
balance to whomsoever is legally entitled thereto; (8) secure the appointment of
a receiver of any Project or any part thereof and/or the Collateral or any part
thereof; or (9) exercise any other or additional rights or remedies granted to a
secured party under the UCC. If pursuant to applicable law prior notice of any
such action is required to be given to Borrower, Borrower hereby acknowledges
that the minimum time required by such applicable law, or if no minimum time is
specified, 10 Banking Days, shall be deemed a reasonable notice period.

            7.2 All reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
with any such suit or proceeding or in connection with the performance by
Administrative Agent of any of Borrower's agreements contained in any of the
Assigned Agreements or any exercise of its rights or remedies hereunder,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with interest thereon (to the
extent permitted by law) computed at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate
from the date on which such costs or expenses are incurred to the date of
payment thereof, shall constitute additional indebtedness secured by this
Agreement and shall be paid by Borrower to Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Banks on demand.

      8 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; DELAY NOT WAIVER.


                                       11

<PAGE>



            8.1 No right, power or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to
Administrative Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy and every such right, power and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder or otherwise shall not
prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or
remedy. Resort to any or all security now or hereafter held by Administrative
Agent may be taken concurrently or successively and in one or several
consolidated or independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
proceedings, or both.

            8.2 No delay or omission of Administrative Agent to exercise any
right or power accruing upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be
construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein; and every power and remedy given by this Agreement may be exercised
from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by Administrative
Agent.

      9 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS Upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of an Event of Default, the proceeds of any sale of or other realization upon,
all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied: first, to all fees, costs
and expenses incurred by and due and owing to Administrative Agent and the Banks
under the Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents or the Collateral
Documents; second, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including
any interest which, but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have
accrued on such amounts); third, to the principal amounts of the Obligations
outstanding; fourth, to any other Obligations of Borrower owing to
Administrative Agent or the Banks; and fifth, to, or as directed by, Borrower.

      10 ATTORNEY-IN-FACT. Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints
Administrative Agent, acting for and on behalf of itself and the Banks and each
successor or assign of Administrative Agent and the Banks, the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of Borrower, with full power and authority in the place and
stead of Borrower and in the name of Borrower, Administrative Agent or otherwise
to enforce all rights, interests and remedies of Borrower with respect to the
Collateral, including, without limitation, the right:

            10.1 to ask, require, demand, receive and give acquittance for any
and all moneys and claims for moneys due and to become due under or arising out
of the Assigned Agreements or any of the other Collateral, including without
limitation, any insurance policies with respect to any Project;

            10.2  to elect remedies thereunder and to endorse any checks or
other instruments or orders in connection therewith;

            10.3 to file any claims or take any action or institute any
proceedings in connection therewith which Administrative Agent may reasonably
deem to be necessary or advisable;


                                       12

<PAGE>



            10.4 to pay, settle or compromise all bills and claims which may be
or become liens or security interests against any or all of the Collateral, or
any part thereof, unless a bond or other security satisfactory to Administrative
Agent has been provided; and

            10.5 upon foreclosure and to the extent provided in the Consents, to
do any and every act which Borrower may do on its behalf with respect to the
Collateral or any part thereof and to exercise any or all of Borrower's rights
and remedies under any or all of the Assigned Agreements;

provided, however, that Administrative Agent shall not exercise any such rights
except upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default. This power
of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

      11 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY PERFORM Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, if Borrower fails to perform any agreement
contained herein, Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause performance
of, such agreement, and the reasonable expenses of Administrative Agent incurred
in connection therewith shall be part of the Obligations.

      12 PERFECTION; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

            12.1 Borrower agrees that from time to time, at the expense of
Borrower, Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver all instruments and
documents, and take all action, that may be reasonably necessary, or that
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect the
assignment and security interest granted or intended to be granted hereby or to
enable Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies
hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Borrower shall (i) if any Collateral shall be evidenced by a
promissory note or other instrument in excess of $5,000, deliver and pledge to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks such note duly endorsed
without recourse, and accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or
assignment, all in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent; and
(ii) execute and deliver to Administrative Agent such financing or continuation
statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments, endorsements or
notices, as may be reasonably necessary or desirable or as Administrative Agent
may reasonably request, in order to perfect and preserve the assignments and
security interests granted or purported to be granted hereby.

            12.2 Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to file one or
more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to
all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of Borrower where
permitted by law.

            12.3 Borrower shall pay all filing, registration and recording fees
and all refiling, re-registration and re-recording fees, and all reasonable
expenses incident to the execution and acknowledgment of this Agreement, any
assurance, and all federal, state, county and municipal stamp taxes and other
taxes, duties, imports, assessments and charges arising out of or in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any agreement supplemental
hereto, any financing statements, and any instruments of further assurance.


                                       13

<PAGE>



            12.4 Borrower shall, promptly upon request, provide to
Administrative Agent all information and evidence it may reasonably request
concerning the Collateral to enable Administrative Agent to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement.

      13 PLACE OF BUSINESS; LOCATION OF RECORDS Unless Administrative Agent is
otherwise notified under Section 5.4, the place of business and chief executive
office of Borrower is, and all records of Borrower concerning the Collateral are
and will be, located at the address set forth in Section 4.24 of the Credit
Agreement and Borrower is, and will be, a limited partnership organized under
the laws of the State of Delaware.

      14 CONTINUING ASSIGNMENT AND SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF NOTES This
Agreement shall create a continuing assignment of, and security interest in, the
Collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full
of the Obligations, (b) be binding upon Borrower, its successors and assigns;
provided, however, that the obligations of Borrower, its successors and assigns
hereunder may not be assigned without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent; and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of
Administrative Agent, to the benefit of Administrative Agent, the Banks and
their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing but subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement,
Administrative Agent or any of the Banks may assign or otherwise transfer all or
any part of or interest in the Notes and the other Credit Documents or other
evidence of indebtedness held by them to any other Person to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and such other Person
shall thereupon become vested with all or an appropriate part of the benefits in
respect thereof granted to the Banks herein or otherwise. The release of the
security interest in any or all of the Collateral, the taking or acceptance of
additional security, or the resort by Administrative Agent to any security it
may have in any order it may deem appropriate, shall not affect the liability of
any person on the indebtedness secured hereby. If this Agreement shall be
terminated or revoked by operation of law, Borrower will indemnify and save
Administrative Agent and the Banks harmless from any loss which may be suffered
or incurred by Administrative Agent and the Banks in acting hereunder prior to
the receipt by Administrative Agent, its successors, transferees, or assigns of
notice of such termination or revocation.

      15 TERMINATION OF SECURITY INTEREST Upon the indefeasible payment in full
of the Obligations, the security interest granted hereby shall terminate and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to Borrower. Upon any such termination,
Administrative Agent will, at Borrower's expense, execute and, subject to
Section 21 hereof, deliver to Borrower such documents (including, without
limitation, UCC-3 termination statements) as Borrower shall reasonably request
to evidence such termination.

      16 ATTORNEYS' FEES In the event any legal action or proceeding (including,
without limitation, any of the remedies provided for herein or at law) is
commenced to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any provision thereof,
unless Borrower is the prevailing party, Borrower shall indemnify each of
Administrative Agent and the Banks for their reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses incurred therein, and if a judgment or award is


                                       14

<PAGE>



entered in any such action or proceeding, such reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses may be made a part of such judgment or award.

      17 LIABILITY Recourse against the Borrower, the other Portfolio Entities,
any Partner, and their respective Affiliates, members, partners, stockholders,
officers, directors and employees under this Agreement shall be limited to the
extent provided in Article 9 of the Credit Agreement.

      18 AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; CONSENTS No amendment, modification, termination
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or consent to any departure by
Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written
concurrence of Administrative Agent and the Borrower.

      19 NOTICES All notices required or permitted under the terms and
provisions hereof shall be in writing and any such notice shall be effective if
given in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.1 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices to Borrower may be given at the address of Borrower set forth in such
Section 12.1.

      20 GOVERNING LAW This Agreement, including all matters of construction,
validity, performance and the creation, validity, enforcement or priority of the
lien of, and security interests created by, this Agreement in or upon the
Collateral shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York, without
reference to conflicts of law (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General
Obligations Law), except as required by mandatory provisions of law and except
to the extent that the validity or perfection of the lien and security interest
hereunder, or remedies hereunder, in respect of any particular Collateral are
governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the state of New York.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the validity, perfection and priority of the lien
and security interest created hereunder in respect to the Operating Accounts is
governed by the laws of the State of California.

      21 REINSTATEMENT This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any amount received by
Administrative Agent in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by Administrative Agent upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation of Borrower or any general partner of
Borrower or upon the dissolution of, or appointment of any intervenor or
conservator of, or trustee or similar official for, Borrower or any general
partner of Borrower or any substantial part of Borrower's or any of its general
partners' assets, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

      22 SEVERABILITY The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any
clause or provision shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part
in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only
such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction and shall not in
any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any
other clause or provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.

      23 SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS All agreements, representations and warranties
made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Credit Agreement and


                                       15

upon payment of the Obligations, and the termination of all Commitments and
other obligations of the Banks under the Credit Documents.

      24 HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE The headings in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any
other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

executed in connection herewith, is intended by the parties as a final
expression of their agreement and is intended as a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms and conditions thereof.

      26 TIME Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall
together constitute one and the same agreement.

THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED
UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO

collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it
or to which it may be entitled at any time.

         2.4 If any default by Owner under any of the Assigned Agreements shall

Credit Agreement, be permitted (but shall not be obligated) to remedy any such
default by giving written notice of such intent to Owner and to the parties to
the Assigned Agreement or Assigned Agreements for which Administrative Agent
intends to remedy the default. After giving such notice of its intent to cure
such default and upon the commencement thereof, Administrative Agent will
proceed diligently to cure such default. Any cure by Administrative Agent of
Owner's default under any of the Assigned Agreements shall not be construed as
an assumption by Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of any obligations,
covenants or agreements of Owner under such Assigned Agreement, and neither
Administrative Agent nor any of the Banks shall be liable to Owner or any other
Person as a result of any actions undertaken by Administrative Agent in curing
or attempting to cure any such default, except as set forth in Section 12.13 of
the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed to release or to affect
in any way the obligations of Owner under the Assigned Agreements.

     3. OBLIGATIONS SECURED. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
this Agreement and all of the Collateral secure the payment and performance when
due of the [IF PROJECT OWNER: GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE
GUARANTY) OF OWNER UNDER THE GUARANTY][IF TURBINE OWNER: OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED
IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) OF EACH OF THE PORTFOLIO ENTITIES (INCLUDING OWNER)

AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS TO WHICH BORROWER IS A PARTY] to the
Administrative Agent and the Banks (the "Obligations"); provided, however, the
Obligations as defined in this Section 3 shall not include any Obligations (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) of any Portfolio Entity under the Credit
Documents relating to or arising from Projects (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) that have achieved Operation prior to the effective date of this
Agreement.

     4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF OWNER. Owner represents and warrants
as of the date hereof as follows:

         4.1 Owner has not assigned any of its rights under the Assigned
Agreements except as provided in the Credit Documents.

         4.2 Owner has not executed and is not aware of any effective financing
statement, security agreement or other instrument similar in effect covering all
or any part of the Collateral, except such as may have been filed pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents or pursuant to the documents
evidencing Permitted Liens.

         4.3 Except as permitted by the Credit Agreement, Owner is lawfully
possessed of ownership of the Collateral and has full right, title and interest
in and to all rights purported to

                                        6

<PAGE>



be granted to it under the Assigned Agreements, not subject to any mortgages,
liens, charges, or encumbrances except Permitted Liens. Owner has full power and
lawful authority to grant and assign the Collateral hereunder.

    5. COVENANTS OF OWNER. Owner covenants as follows:

         5.1 Any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement or any Assigned
Agreement may be taken by Administrative Agent either in Owner's name or in
Administrative Agent's name, as Administrative Agent may deem necessary.

         5.2 Owner will, so long as any Obligations shall be outstanding,
warrant and defend its title to the Collateral and the interest of
Administrative Agent in the Collateral against any claim or demand of any
persons (other than Permitted Liens) which could reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect Owner's title to, or Administrative Agent's right or
interest in, such Collateral.

         5.3 Owner will at all times keep accurate and complete records of the
Collateral. Owner shall permit representatives of Administrative Agent upon
reasonable prior notice, and in accordance with Section 5.6 of the Credit
Agreement, at any time during normal business hours of Owner to inspect and make
abstracts from Owner's books and records pertaining to the Collateral. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, at
Administrative Agent's request, Owner shall promptly deliver copies of any and
all such records to Administrative Agent.

         5.4 Unless waived in writing by Administrative Agent, Owner shall give
Administrative Agent at least 45 days' notice before it changes the location of
its principal place of business, chief executive office or state of organization
and shall at the expense of Owner execute and deliver such instruments and
documents as may reasonably be required by Administrative Agent to maintain a
prior perfected security interest in the Collateral.

     6. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of an Event of Default under the
Credit Agreement, whatever the reason therefor and whether it shall be voluntary
or involuntary or be effected by operation of law, or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body, shall constitute an event of default
hereunder (an "Event of Default").

     7. REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         7.1 If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Administrative Agent may (a) proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in
it by this Agreement, including but not limited to, the right to cause all
revenues pledged hereby as security and all other moneys pledged hereunder to be
paid directly to it, and to enforce its rights hereunder to such payments and
all other rights hereunder by such appropriate judicial proceedings as it shall
deem most effective to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or
in equity or otherwise, whether for specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement contained in any of the Assigned

                                        7

<PAGE>



Agreements, or in aid of the exercise of any power therein or herein granted, or
for any foreclosure hereunder and sale under a judgment or decree in any
judicial proceeding, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in
it by this Agreement or by law; (b) cause any action at law or suit in equity or
other proceeding to be instituted and prosecuted to collect or enforce any
Obligations or rights hereunder or included in the Collateral, or to foreclose
or enforce any other agreement or other instrument by or under or pursuant to
which such Obligations are issued or secured, subject in each case to the
provisions and requirements thereof; (c) sell or otherwise dispose of any or all
of the Collateral or cause the Collateral to be sold or otherwise disposed of in
one or more sales or transactions, at such prices and in such manner as
Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable, and for cash or on credit
or for future delivery, without assumption of any credit risk at any broker's
board or at public or private sale, with or without a warranty of title, without
demand of performance or notice of intention to sell or of time or place of sale
(except such notice as is required by applicable statute and cannot be waived),
it being agreed that Administrative Agent may be a purchaser on behalf of the
Banks or on its own behalf at any such sale and that Administrative Agent, any
Bank, or any other Person who may be a bona fide purchaser for value and without
notice of any claims of any or all of the Collateral so sold shall thereafter

law; (d) incur reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,

Credit Documents, and apply the balance to the Loans of Borrower as provided for
in the Credit Agreement and any remaining excess balance to whomsoever is
legally entitled thereto; (g) secure the appointment of a receiver of the

or remedies granted to a secured party under the UCC. If pursuant to applicable
law prior notice of any such action is required to be given to Owner, Owner

no minimum time is specified, 10 Banking Days, shall be deemed a reasonable
notice period.

         7.2 All reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with any such
suit or proceeding or in connection with the performance by Administrative Agent
of any of Owner's agreements contained in any of the Assigned Agreements or any

Agreement, together with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by

                                        8

<PAGE>



law) computed at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate from the date on
which such costs or expenses are incurred to the date of payment thereof, shall
constitute additional indebtedness secured by this Agreement and shall be paid
by Owner to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks on demand.

     8. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; DELAY NOT WAIVER.

         8.1 No right, power or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to
Administrative Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy and every such right, power and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder or otherwise shall not
prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or
remedy. Resort to any or all security now or hereafter held by Administrative
Agent may be taken concurrently or successively and in one or several
consolidated or independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
proceedings, or both.

         8.2 No delay or omission of Administrative Agent to exercise any right
or power accruing upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed
to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and
every power and remedy given by this Agreement may be exercised from time to
time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by Administrative Agent.

     9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of an Event of Default, the proceeds of any sale of or other realization upon,
all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied: first, to all fees, costs
and expenses incurred by and due and owing to Administrative Agent and the Banks
under the Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents or the Collateral
Documents; second, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including
any interest which, but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have
accrued on such amounts); third, to the principal amounts of the Obligations
outstanding; fourth, to any other Obligations of Owner owing to Administrative
Agent or the Banks; and fifth, to, or as directed by, Owner.

     10. ATTORNEY-IN-FACT. Owner hereby constitutes and appoints Administrative
Agent, acting for and on behalf of itself and the Banks and each successor or
assign of Administrative Agent and the Banks, the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of Owner, with full power and authority in the place and stead
of Owner and in the name of Owner, Administrative Agent or otherwise to enforce
all rights, interests and remedies of Owner with respect to the Collateral,
including, without limitation, the right:

         10.1 to ask, require, demand, receive and give acquittance for any and
all moneys and claims for moneys due and to become due under or arising out of
the Assigned Agreements or any of the other Collateral, including without
limitation, any insurance policies;

                                        9

<PAGE>



         10.2 to elect remedies thereunder and to endorse any checks or other
instruments or orders in connection therewith;

         10.3 to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings
in connection therewith which Administrative Agent may reasonably deem to be
necessary or advisable;

         10.4 to pay, settle or compromise all bills and claims which may be or
become liens or security interests against any or all of the Collateral, or any
part thereof, unless a bond or other security satisfactory to Administrative
Agent has been provided; and

         10.5 upon foreclosure and to the extent provided in the Consents, to do
any and every act which Owner may do on its behalf with respect to the
Collateral or any part thereof and to exercise any or all of Owner's rights and
remedies under any or all of the Assigned Agreements;

provided, however, that Administrative Agent shall not exercise any such rights
except upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default. This power
of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

     11. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY PERFORM. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, if Owner fails to perform any agreement
contained herein, Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause performance
of, such agreement, and the reasonable expenses of Administrative Agent incurred
in connection therewith shall be part of the Obligations.

     12. PERFECTION; FURTHER ASSURANCES.


         12.1 Owner agrees that from time to time, at the expense of Owner,
Owner shall promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and take
all action, that may be reasonably necessary, or that Administrative Agent may
reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect the assignment and security
interest granted or intended to be granted hereby or to enable Administrative
Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to
any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Owner shall
(a) if any Collateral shall be evidenced by a promissory note or other
instrument in excess of $5,000, deliver and pledge to Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Banks such note duly endorsed without recourse, and
accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment, all in form
and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent; and (b) execute and deliver
to Administrative Agent such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
thereto, and such other instruments, endorsements or notices, as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable or as Administrative Agent may reasonably
request, in order to perfect and preserve the assignments and security interests
granted or purported to be granted hereby.

                                       10

<PAGE>



         12.2 Owner hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all or
any part of the Collateral without the signature of Owner where permitted by
law.

         12.3 Owner shall pay all filing, registration and recording fees and
all refiling, re-registration and re-recording fees, and all reasonable expenses
incident to the execution and acknowledgment of this Agreement, any assurance,
and all federal, state, county and municipal stamp taxes and other taxes,
duties, imports, assessments and charges arising out of or in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any agreement supplemental hereto,
any financing statements, and any instruments of further assurance.

         12.4 Owner shall, promptly upon request, provide to Administrative
Agent all information and evidence it may reasonably request concerning the
Collateral to enable Administrative Agent to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement.

     13. PLACE OF BUSINESS; LOCATION OF RECORDS. Unless Administrative Agent is
otherwise notified under Section 5.4, the place of business and chief executive
office of Owner is, and all records of Owner concerning the Collateral are and
will be, located at the address set forth in Schedule 4.24 to the Credit
Agreement and Owner is, and will be, a _________ organized under the laws of the
state of ________.

     14. CONTINUING ASSIGNMENT AND SECURITY INTEREST; [FOR PROJECT OWNERS ONLY:
TRANSFER OF GUARANTY]. This Agreement shall create a continuing assignment of,
and security interest in, the Collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and
effect until payment in full of the Obligations, (b) be binding upon Owner, its
successors and assigns; provided, however, that the obligations of Owner, its
successors and assigns hereunder may not be assigned without the prior written
consent of Administrative Agent; and (c) inure, together with the rights and
remedies of Administrative Agent, to the benefit of Administrative Agent, the
Banks and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing but subject to the terms of the Credit
Agreement, Administrative Agent or any of the Banks may assign or otherwise
transfer all or any part of or interest in the Notes and the other Credit
Documents[INSERT IF PROJECT OWNER: , INCLUDING THE GUARANTY,] or other evidence
of indebtedness held by them to any other Person to the extent permitted by and
in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and such other Person shall thereupon
become vested with all or an appropriate part of the benefits in respect thereof
granted to the Banks herein or otherwise. The release of the security interest
in any or all of the Collateral, the taking or acceptance of additional
security, or the resort by Administrative Agent to any security it may have in
any order it may deem appropriate, shall not affect the liability of any person
on the indebtedness secured hereby. If this Agreement shall be terminated or
revoked by operation of law, Owner will indemnify and save Administrative Agent
and the Banks harmless from any loss which may be suffered or incurred by
Administrative Agent and the Banks in acting hereunder prior to the receipt by
Administrative Agent, its successors, transferees, or assigns of notice of such
termination or revocation.

                                       11

of the Obligations, the security interest granted hereby shall terminate and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to Owner. Upon any such termination,
Administrative Agent will, at Owner's expense, execute and, subject to Section
21 hereof, deliver to Owner such documents (including, without limitation, UCC-3
termination statements) as Owner shall reasonably request to evidence such
termination.

     16. ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event any legal action or proceeding
(including, without limitation, any of the remedies provided for herein or at
law) is commenced to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any provision
thereof, unless Owner is the prevailing party, Owner shall indemnify each of
Administrative Agent and the Banks for their reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses incurred therein, and if a judgment or award is entered
in any such action or proceeding, such reasonable attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses may be made a part of such judgment or award.

                  2.1.4 the proceeds of all of the foregoing (all of the
collateral described in clauses 2.1.1 through 2.1.4, being herein collectively
referred to as the "Collateral"), including without limitation, (a) all rights

collected, exchanged or otherwise disposed of, whether voluntarily or

              2.2 In order to effectuate the foregoing, Owner has heretofore
delivered, or concurrently with the delivery hereof, is delivering to

supplements to the foregoing, included in the Collateral, as they are entered
into by Owner promptly upon the execution thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, no such future lease, construction agreement,
operation agreement or other material agreement may be entered into by Owner
except as permitted under the Credit Documents.

              2.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Owner shall remain liable under each of the Assigned Agreements to perform all
of the obligations undertaken by it thereunder, all in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms and provisions thereof, and Administrative Agent shall

of or arising out of this Agreement, nor shall Administrative Agent be required
or obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any obligations of Owner
thereunder or to make any payment or inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of
any payment

                                        3

<PAGE>

enforce the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to
which it may be entitled at any time.

              2.4 If any default by Owner under any of the Assigned Agreements
shall occur and be continuing, then Administrative Agent shall, at its option
and after the expiration of the applicable cure periods under Section 8.1.7 of
the Credit Agreement, be permitted (but shall not be obligated) to remedy any
such default by giving written notice of such intent to Owner and to the parties
to the Assigned Agreement or Assigned Agreements for which Administrative Agent
intends to remedy the default. After giving such notice of its intent to cure
such default and upon the commencement thereof, Administrative Agent will
proceed diligently to cure such default. Any cure by Administrative Agent of
Owner's default under any of the Assigned Agreements shall not be construed as
an assumption by Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of any obligations,
covenants or agreements of Owner under such Assigned Agreement, and neither
Administrative Agent nor any of the Banks shall be liable to Owner or any other
Person as a result of any actions undertaken by Administrative Agent in curing
or attempting to cure any such default, except as set forth in Section 12.13 of
the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed to release or to affect
in any way the obligations of Owner under the Assigned Agreements.

         3. OBLIGATIONS SECURED. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, this Agreement and all of the Collateral secure the payment and
performance when due of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of
each of the Portfolio Entities (including Owner) under the Credit Documents,
including Borrower's Obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents to which Borrower is a party to the Administrative Agent and the Banks
(the "Obligations"); provided, however, the Obligations as defined in this
Section 3 shall not include any Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
of any Portfolio Entity under the Credit Documents relating to or arising from
Projects (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that have achieved Operation prior
to the effective date of this Agreement.

         4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF OWNER. Owner represents and
warrants as of the date hereof as follows:

              4.1 Owner has not assigned any of its rights under the Assigned
Agreements except as provided in the Credit Documents.

              4.2 Owner has not executed and is not aware of any effective
financing statement, security agreement or other instrument similar in effect
covering all or any part of the Collateral, except such as may have been filed
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents or pursuant to the
documents evidencing Permitted Liens.

              4.3 Except as permitted by the Credit Agreement, Owner is lawfully
possessed of ownership of the Collateral and has full right, title and interest
in and to all rights purported to be granted to it under the Assigned
Agreements, not subject to any mortgages, liens, charges, or encumbrances except
Permitted Liens. Owner has full power and lawful authority to grant and assign
the Collateral hereunder.


                                        4

<PAGE>



         5. COVENANTS OF OWNER. Owner covenants as follows:

              5.1 Any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement or any
Assigned Agreement may be taken by Administrative Agent either in Owner's name
or in Administrative Agent's name, as Administrative Agent may deem necessary.

              5.2 Owner will, so long as any Obligations shall be outstanding,
warrant and defend its title to the Collateral and the interest of
Administrative Agent in the Collateral against any claim or demand of any
persons (other than Permitted Liens) which could reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect Owner's title to, or Administrative Agent's right or
interest in, such Collateral.

              5.3 Owner will at all times keep accurate and complete records of
the Collateral. Owner shall permit representatives of Administrative Agent upon
reasonable prior notice, and in accordance with Section 5.6 of the Credit
Agreement, at any time during normal business hours of Owner to inspect and make
abstracts from Owner's books and records pertaining to the Collateral. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, at
Administrative Agent's request, Owner shall promptly deliver copies of any and
all such records to Administrative Agent.

              5.4 Unless waived in writing by Administrative Agent, Owner shall
give Administrative Agent at least 45 days' notice before it changes the
location of its principal place of business, chief executive office or state of
organization and shall at the expense of Owner execute and deliver such
instruments and documents as may reasonably be required by Administrative Agent
to maintain a prior perfected security interest in the Collateral.

         6. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of an Event of Default under the
Credit Agreement, whatever the reason therefor and whether it shall be voluntary
or involuntary or be effected by operation of law, or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body, shall constitute an event of default
hereunder (an "Event of Default").

         7. REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT.

              7.1 If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Administrative Agent may (a) proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in
it by this Agreement, including but not limited to, the right to cause all
revenues pledged hereby as security and all other moneys pledged hereunder to be
paid directly to it, and to enforce its rights hereunder to such payments and
all other rights hereunder by such appropriate judicial proceedings as it shall
deem most effective to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or
in equity or otherwise, whether for specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement contained in any of the Assigned Agreements, or in aid of the exercise
of any power therein or herein granted, or for any foreclosure hereunder and
sale under a judgment or decree in any judicial proceeding, or to enforce any
other legal or equitable right vested in it by this Agreement or by law; (b)
cause any action at law or suit in equity or other proceeding to be instituted
and prosecuted to collect or

                                        5

<PAGE>



enforce any Obligations or rights hereunder or included in the Collateral, or to
foreclose or enforce any other agreement or other instrument by or under or
pursuant to which such Obligations are issued or secured, subject in each case
to the provisions and requirements thereof; (c) sell or otherwise dispose of any
or all of the Collateral or cause the Collateral to be sold or otherwise
disposed of in one or more sales or transactions, at such prices and in such
manner as Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable, and for cash or
on credit or for future delivery, without assumption of any credit risk at any
broker's board or at public or private sale, with or without a warranty of
title, without demand of performance or notice of intention to sell or of time
or place of sale (except such notice as is required by applicable statute and
cannot be waived), it being agreed that Administrative Agent may be a purchaser
on behalf of the Banks or on its own behalf at any such sale and that
Administrative Agent, any Bank, or any other Person who may be a bona fide
purchaser for value and without notice of any claims of any or all of the
Collateral so sold shall thereafter hold the same absolutely free from any claim
or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption, of Owner, any
such demand, notice or right and equity being hereby expressly waived and
released to the extent permitted by law; (d) incur reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable consultants' fees, and other
costs appropriate to the exercise of any right or power under this Agreement;
(e) perform any obligation of Owner hereunder or under any other Credit
Document, and make payments, purchase, contest or compromise any encumbrance,
charge or lien, and pay taxes and expenses without, however, any obligation to
do so; (f) in connection with any acceleration and foreclosure, take possession
of the Collateral and render it usable and repair and renovate the same without,
however, any obligation to do so, and enter upon any Site or any other location
where the same may be located for that purpose, control, manage, operate, rent
and lease the Collateral, collect all rents and income from the Collateral and
apply the same to reimburse the Banks for any cost or expenses incurred
hereunder or under any of the Credit Documents and to the payment or performance
of Owner's obligations hereunder or under any of the Credit Documents, and apply
the balance to the Loans of Borrower as provided for in the Credit Agreement and
any remaining excess balance to whomsoever is legally entitled thereto; (g)
secure the appointment of a receiver of the Collateral or any part thereof; or
(h) exercise any other or additional rights or remedies granted to a secured
party under the UCC. If pursuant to applicable law prior notice of any such
action is required to be given to Owner, Owner hereby acknowledges that the
minimum time required by such applicable law, or if no minimum time is
specified, 10 Banking Days, shall be deemed a reasonable notice period.

              7.2 All reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
with any such suit or proceeding or in connection with the performance by
Administrative Agent of any of Owner's agreements contained in any of the
Assigned Agreements or any exercise of its rights or remedies hereunder,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with interest thereon (to the
extent permitted by law) computed at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate
from the date on which such costs or expenses are incurred to the date of
payment thereof, shall constitute additional indebtedness secured by this
Agreement and shall be paid by Owner to Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Banks on demand.

         8. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; DELAY NOT WAIVER.

                                        6

<PAGE>



              8.1 No right, power or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to
Administrative Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy and every such right, power and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder or otherwise shall not
prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or
remedy. Resort to any or all security now or hereafter held by Administrative
Agent may be taken concurrently or successively and in one or several
consolidated or independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
proceedings, or both.

              8.2 No delay or omission of Administrative Agent to exercise any
right or power accruing upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be
construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein; and every power and remedy given by this Agreement may be exercised
from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by Administrative
Agent.

         9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, the proceeds of any sale of or other
realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied: first, to
all fees, costs and expenses incurred by and due and owing to Administrative
Agent and the Banks under the Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents or
the Collateral Documents; second, to accrued and unpaid interest on the
Obligations (including any interest which, but for the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts); third, to the principal
amounts of the Obligations outstanding; fourth, to any other Obligations of
Owner owing to Administrative Agent or the Banks; and fifth, to, or as directed
by, Owner.

         10. ATTORNEY-IN-FACT. Owner hereby constitutes and appoints
Administrative Agent, acting for and on behalf of itself and the Banks and each
successor or assign of Administrative Agent and the Banks, the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of Owner, with full power and authority in the place and stead
of Owner and in the name of Owner, Administrative Agent or otherwise to enforce
all rights, interests and remedies of Owner with respect to the Collateral,
including, without limitation, the right:

              10.1 to ask, require, demand, receive and give acquittance for any
and all moneys and claims for moneys due and to become due under or arising out
of the Assigned Agreements or any of the other Collateral, including without
limitation, any insurance policies;

              10.2 to elect remedies thereunder and to endorse any checks or
other instruments or orders in connection therewith;

              10.3 to file any claims or take any action or institute any
proceedings in connection therewith which Administrative Agent may reasonably
deem to be necessary or advisable;

                                        7

<PAGE>



              10.4 to pay, settle or compromise all bills and claims which may
be or become liens or security interests against any or all of the Collateral,
or any part thereof, unless a bond or other security satisfactory to
Administrative Agent has been provided; and

              10.5 upon foreclosure and to the extent provided in the Consents,
to do any and every act which Owner may do on its behalf with respect to the
Collateral or any part thereof and to exercise any or all of Owner's rights and
remedies under any or all of the Assigned Agreements;

provided, however, that Administrative Agent shall not exercise any such rights
except upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default. This power
of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

         11. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY PERFORM. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, if Owner fails to perform any agreement
contained herein, Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause performance
of, such agreement, and the reasonable expenses of Administrative Agent incurred
in connection therewith shall be part of the Obligations.

         12. PERFECTION; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

              12.1 Owner agrees that from time to time, at the expense of Owner,
Owner shall promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and take
all action, that may be reasonably necessary, or that Administrative Agent may
reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect the assignment and security
interest granted or intended to be granted hereby or to enable Administrative
Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to
any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Owner shall
(a) if any Collateral shall be evidenced by a promissory note or other
instrument in excess of $5,000, deliver and pledge to Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Banks such note duly endorsed without recourse, and
accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment, all in form
and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent; and (b) execute and deliver
to Administrative Agent such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
thereto, and such other instruments, endorsements or notices, as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable or as Administrative Agent may reasonably
request, in order to perfect and preserve the assignments and security interests
granted or purported to be granted hereby.

              12.2 Owner hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to file one or
more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to
all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of Owner where permitted
by law.

              12.3 Owner shall pay all filing, registration and recording fees
and all refiling, re-registration and re-recording fees, and all reasonable
expenses incident to the execution and acknowledgment of this Agreement, any
assurance, and all federal, state, county and municipal stamp taxes and other
taxes, duties, imports, assessments and charges arising out of or in

                                        8

<PAGE>



connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any agreement
supplemental hereto, any financing statements, and any instruments of further
assurance.

              12.4 Owner shall, promptly upon request, provide to Administrative
Agent all information and evidence it may reasonably request concerning the
Collateral to enable Administrative Agent to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement.

         13. PLACE OF BUSINESS; LOCATION OF RECORDS. Unless Administrative Agent
is otherwise notified under Section 5.4, the place of business and chief
executive office of Owner is, and all records of Owner concerning the Collateral
are and will be, located at the address set forth in Schedule 4.24 to the Credit
Agreement and Owner is, and will be, a          organized under the laws of the
state of        .

         14. CONTINUING ASSIGNMENT AND SECURITY INTEREST. This Agreement shall
create a continuing assignment of, and security interest in, the Collateral and
shall (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the
Obligations, (b) be binding upon Owner, its successors and assigns; provided,
however, that the obligations of Owner, its successors and assigns hereunder may
not be assigned without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent; and
(c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent, to the
benefit of Administrative Agent, the Banks and their respective successors,
transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing but
subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, Administrative Agent or any of the
Banks may assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of or interest in the
Notes and the other Credit Documents or other evidence of indebtedness held by
them to any other Person to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the
Credit Agreement, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all
or an appropriate part of the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Banks
herein or otherwise. The release of the security interest in any or all of the
Collateral, the taking or acceptance of additional security, or the resort by
Administrative Agent to any security it may have in any order it may deem
appropriate, shall not affect the liability of any person on the indebtedness
secured hereby. If this Agreement shall be terminated or revoked by operation of
law, Owner will indemnify and save Administrative Agent and the Banks harmless
from any loss which may be suffered or incurred by Administrative Agent and the
Banks in acting hereunder prior to the receipt by Administrative Agent, its
successors, transferees, or assigns of notice of such termination or revocation.

         15. TERMINATION OF SECURITY INTEREST. Upon the indefeasible payment in
full of the Obligations, the security interest granted hereby shall terminate
and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to Owner. Upon any such
termination, Administrative Agent will, at Owner's expense, execute and, subject
to Section 21 hereof, deliver to Owner such documents (including, without
limitation, UCC-3 termination statements) as Owner shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination.

         16. ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event any legal action or proceeding
(including, without limitation, any of the remedies provided for herein or at
law) is commenced to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any provision
thereof, unless Owner is the prevailing party, Owner shall indemnify each of
Administrative Agent and the Banks for their reasonable attorneys' fees

                                        9

<PAGE>



and other costs and expenses incurred therein, and if a judgment or award is
entered in any such action or proceeding, such reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses may be made a part of such judgment or award.

         17. LIABILITY. Recourse against the Owner, the other Portfolio
Entities, any Partner and their respective Affiliates, members, partners,
stockholders, officers, directors and employees under this Agreement shall be
limited to the extent provided in Article 9 of the Credit Agreement.

         18. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; CONSENTS. No amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or consent to any
departure by Owner therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the
written concurrence of Administrative Agent and the Owner.

         19. NOTICES. All notices required or permitted under the terms and
provisions hereof shall be in writing and any such notice shall be effective if
given in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.1 of the Credit Agreement.

Section 12.1.

         20. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement, including all matters of
construction, validity, performance and the creation, validity, enforcement or
priority of the lien of, and security interests created by, this Agreement in or
upon the Collateral shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York,
without reference to conflicts of law (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York
General Obligations Law), except as required by mandatory provisions of law and
except to the extent that the validity or perfection of the lien and security
interest hereunder, or remedies hereunder, in respect of any particular
Collateral are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the state of
New York.

         21. REINSTATEMENT. This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any amount received by
Administrative Agent in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by Administrative Agent upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation of Owner or any general partner of Owner
or upon the dissolution of, or appointment of any intervenor or conservator of,
or trustee or similar official for, Owner or any general partner of Owner or any
substantial part of Owner's or any of its general partners' assets, or
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

         22. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and
if any clause or provision shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in
part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect
only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction and shall
not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or
any other clause or provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.

         23. SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. All agreements, representations and
warranties made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Credit Agreement and the making of the Loans and extensions of
credit thereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this

                                       10

<PAGE>



Agreement or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements, representations and

convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement
for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

         25. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with any other agreement
executed in connection herewith, is intended by the parties as a final
expression of their agreement and is intended as a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms and conditions thereof.

         26. TIME. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

         27. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall
together constitute one and the same agreement.

THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED
UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG OWNER AND
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. OWNER AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED
FUTURE DEALINGS. OWNER AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT
THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION
WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

         29. ADDITIONAL WAIVERS. Owner hereby waives and relinquishes all rights
and remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not
to assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including without
limitation (a) any right to require Administrative Agent or the Banks to proceed
against any Portfolio Entity or any other Person or to proceed against or
exhaust any security held by Administrative Agent or the Banks at any time or to
pursue any other remedy in Administrative Agent's or the Banks' power before
proceeding against Owner, (b) any defense that may arise by reason of the
incapacity, lack of power or authority, death, dissolution, merger, termination
or disability of any Portfolio Entity or any other Person or the failure of
Administrative Agent or the Banks to file or enforce a claim against the estate
(in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any Portfolio Entity
or any other Person, (c) demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind,
including without limitation notice of the existence, creation or incurring of
any new or additional indebtedness or

                                       11

<PAGE>



obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of any Portfolio Entity,
Administrative Agent, the Banks, any endorser or creditor of the foregoing or on
the part of any other Person under this or any other instrument in connection
with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by Administrative Agent or
the Banks as collateral or in connection with any Obligations, (d) any defense
based upon an election of remedies by Administrative Agent or the Banks,
including without limitation an election to proceed by non-judicial rather than
judicial foreclosure, which destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights
of Owner, the right of Owner to proceed against a Portfolio Entity or another
Person for reimbursement, or both, (e) any defense based on any offset against
any amounts which may be owed by any Person to Owner for any reason whatsoever,
(f) any defense based on any act, failure to act, delay or omission whatsoever
on the part of a Portfolio Entity of the failure by a Portfolio Entity to do any
act or thing or to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement to be
observed or performed by it under the Credit Documents, (g) any defense based
upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety
must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that
of the principal provided, that, upon payment in full of the Obligations, this
Agreement shall no longer be of any force or effect, (h) any defense, setoff or
counterclaim which may at any time be available to or asserted by a Portfolio
Entity against Administrative Agent, the Banks or any other Person under the
Credit Documents, (i) any duty on the part of Administrative Agent or the Banks
to disclose to Owner any facts Administrative Agent or the Banks may now or
hereafter know about any Portfolio Entity, regardless of whether Administrative
Agent or the Banks have reason to believe that any such facts materially
increase the risk beyond that which Owner intends to assume, or have reason to
believe that such facts are unknown to Owner, or have a reasonable opportunity
to communicate such facts to Owner, since Owner acknowledges that Owner is fully
responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of the
Portfolio Entities and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment
of any obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed, (j) the fact that any
Portfolio Entity may at any time in the future dispose of all or part of its
direct or indirect interest in any other Portfolio Entity, (k) any defense based
on any change in the time, manner or place of any payment under, or in any other
term of, the Credit Documents or any other amendment, renewal, extension,
acceleration, compromise or waiver of or any consent or departure from the terms
of the Credit Documents, (1) any defense arising because of Administrative
Agent's or the Banks' election, in any proceeding instituted under the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, and (m) any defense based upon any borrowing or grant of a
security interest under Section 364 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

                             SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT

         This SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), dated as of
________________, is made by and between ___________________________, a
__________________ ("Junior Claimant"), and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as
Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent") for the Senior Claimants (as
defined below).

                                     PREFACE

         A. Calpine Construction Finance Company, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership ("Borrower"), has entered into that certain Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement"), dated as of February 15, 2001, by and
among Borrower, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Lead Arranger, LC Bank and
Administrative Agent, Credit Suisse First Boston, acting through its New York
Branch, as Lead Arranger, Syndication Agent and Bookrunner and the financial
institutions listed on Exhibit H thereto (the "Banks" and, together with
Administrative Agent, Lead Arrangers, Syndication Agent, Bookrunner, LC Bank,
and all financial institutions parties to the Credit Agreement, the "Senior
Claimants"), pursuant to which the Senior Claimants will, subject to the terms
and conditions contained therein and in the other Credit Documents, provide
credit facilities to Borrower in connection with Borrower's development,
construction and ownership of the Projects.

         B. Borrower and Junior Claimant have and/or will enter into one or more
promissory notes and/or other documents and instruments (collectively, the
"Subordinated Agreement") pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein and herein, Junior Claimant has and/or will lend to Borrower
funds in a principal amount up to the amount of Contributions required or
permitted to be made by Borrower under the Credit Agreement (the "Junior
Claimant Loan").

         C. The Senior Claimants have agreed that Borrower may incur such
indebtedness to Junior Claimant under the Subordinated Agreement only if Junior
Claimant shall join in this Agreement and Junior Claimant shall subordinate, to
the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, all claims and rights in
respect of the Subordinated Debt (as defined below) to all Senior Claims (as
defined below) to the extent set forth in this Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and as an inducement to
the Senior Claimants to grant financial accommodations to Borrower, and in
consideration of the granting thereof, the parties hereby agree as follows:

         1. DEFINITIONS. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning given in the Credit Agreement as in effect
on the date hereof. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have
the following respective meanings:

<PAGE>



                  "Proceeding" means any (a) insolvency, bankruptcy,
receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other
similar proceeding of or against Borrower, its property or its creditors as
such, (b) proceeding for any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of
Borrower, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings, (c) general assignment for the benefit of creditors of
Borrower or (d) other marshalling of the assets of Borrower.

                  "Senior Claims" means, subject in each case to Sections 3 and
8 hereof, (a) the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Loans
under the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, any interest accruing
thereon at the legal rate after the commencement of any Proceeding and any
additional interest that would have accrued thereon but for the commencement of
such Proceeding); and (b) all other Obligations of Borrower to any Senior
Claimants, whether now existing or hereafter incurred or created, under or with
respect to the Credit Documents or any replacement, supplement to, or
refinancing of the Loans and other Obligations of the Borrower to any Senior
Claimants permitted under Section 3 hereof.

                  "Subordinated Debt" means all indebtedness owing to Junior
Claimant arising under or in respect of the Subordinated Debt Documents.

                  "Subordinated Debt Documents" means the Subordinated
Agreement, any promissory note or other instrument relating thereto and any
other documents or instruments directly relating to the foregoing (including any
amendments, replacements or substitutions thereof).

         2. CERTAIN SUBORDINATION TERMS. Until all Senior Claims shall have been
paid in full and the Senior Claimants' commitments irrevocably terminated under
the Credit Documents, and notwithstanding anything in the Subordinated Debt
Documents to the contrary:

                  2.1 Except as permitted under the Credit Agreement (including
Sections 3.10 and 7.2.1(8) thereof), Borrower shall not, directly or indirectly,
make any payment of principal, interest or otherwise on or in respect of the
Subordinated Debt.

                  2.2 Except for the right to demand and accept payments
permitted under the Credit Agreement or as provided in Section 2.1 or 2.5.2 of
this Agreement, Junior Claimant shall not demand, sue for, or accept from
Borrower or any other Person any such payment or collateral, nor take any other
action to enforce or collect upon any such payment or to enforce its rights to
receive any such payment, in either case in respect of the Subordinated Debt,
provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the right or ability of
Junior Claimant (i) to receive payments from Borrower in respect of the
Subordinated Debt as provided in Section 2.1 so long as no Event of Default
under the Credit Agreement has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) to accelerate
the maturity of the Subordinated Debt at any time after the Loans under the
Credit Agreement have been accelerated; and provided further that in the event
that the Senior Claimants rescind the acceleration of the Loans and provide
written notice to Junior Claimant thereof, or the Junior Claimant otherwise
becomes aware of such rescission, Junior Claimant shall rescind the acceleration
of the Subordinated Debt.

<PAGE>



                  2.3 Neither Borrower nor the Junior Claimant shall take any
action prejudicial to or inconsistent with the Senior Claimants' priority
position over Junior Claimant created by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any action which will hinder, delay or otherwise prevent the Senior
Claimants from taking any action they deem necessary to enforce rights with
respect to the Senior Claims or the Lien of the Collateral Documents. Junior
Claimant shall not take any action or otherwise act to contest on account of the
Subordinated Debt (i) the validity or priority of any Liens or security
interests granted to, or for the benefit of, the Senior Claimants, (ii) the
relevant rights and duties of the Senior Claimants with respect to the Junior
Claimant on account of any Subordinated Debt as established in this Agreement or
(iii) Senior Claimants' exercise of remedies in accordance with the Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

                  2.4 Each document or instrument evidencing Subordinated Debt
shall bear a legend providing that payment of the Subordinated Debt thereunder
has been subordinated to prior payment of the Senior Claims in the manner and to
the extent set forth in this Agreement.

                  2.5 Without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, acting in its sole discretion, Junior Claimant shall not commence or join
with any other creditor or creditors of Borrower in commencing any Proceeding
against Borrower or any general partner of Borrower, but may join in any
Proceeding after it has commenced. At any general meeting of creditors of
Borrower or any general partner thereof, or in the event of any Proceeding, if
all Senior Claims have not been paid in full at such time, Administrative Agent
on behalf of the Senior Claimants is hereby irrevocably authorized at any such
meeting or in any such Proceeding:

                         2.5.1 to enforce claims comprising Subordinated Debt in
the name of Junior Claimant, by proof of debt, proof of claim, suit or
otherwise;

                         2.5.2 to collect any assets of Borrower distributed,
divided or applied by way of dividend or payment as a result of a Proceeding, or
such securities issued, on account of Subordinated Debt as a result thereof and
apply the same, or the proceeds of any realization upon the same that the Senior
Claimants in their discretion elect to effect, to Senior Claims until all Senior
Claims shall have been paid in full (the Senior Claimants hereby agreeing to
render any surplus to Junior Claimant and/or other subordinated creditors, as
their interests appear, or to interplead such surplus with a court of competent
jurisdiction); and

                         2.5.3 to take generally any action in connection with
any such meeting or proceeding which Junior Claimant might otherwise take in
respect of the Subordinated Debt and claims relating thereto; provided, however,
that Junior Claimant shall retain, to the exclusion of Senior Claimants and
Administrative Agent, the right to vote claims comprising or arising out of the
Subordinated Debt in any Proceeding, including the right to vote to accept or
reject any plan of partial or complete liquidation, reorganization,
readjustment, arrangement, composition or extension.

                  After the commencement of any such Proceeding, Junior Claimant
may inquire in writing of Administrative Agent on behalf of the Senior Claimants
whether the Senior Claimants intend to exercise the foregoing rights with
respect to the Subordinated Debt. Should the Senior Claimants fail, at least 20
days before the deadline therefor, either to file a proof of claim with respect
to the Subordinated Debt and to furnish a copy thereof to the Junior Claimant,
or to inform such Junior Claimant in writing that the Senior Claimants intend to
exercise their rights to assert the Subordinated Debt in the manner hereinabove
provided, Junior Claimant may, but shall not be required to, proceed to file a
proof of claim with respect to the Subordinated Debt and take such further steps
with respect thereto, not inconsistent with this Agreement, as Junior Claimant
may deem proper.

                  2.6 Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, Junior Creditor may, but shall have no obligation to, upon not
less than 10 days prior written notice to Administrative Agent, purchase all of
the outstanding Loans and other Obligations of Borrower owing to the Senior
Claimants by irrevocably tendering, in immediately available funds, full payment
of the Purchase Price (as defined below) to Senior Claimants:

                         2.6.1 The Purchase Price shall be equal to the total
amount of Senior Claims at the time of acceleration (assuming such obligations
have been accelerated);

                         2.6.2 Any such purchase by Junior Claimant shall be
without warranty by, or recourse to, the Senior Claimants, except with respect
to the legal and beneficial ownership by the Senior Claimants of the Obligations
so purchased, free and clear of all Liens and rights of others; and

                         2.6.3 Concurrently with any such purchase the Senior
Claimants shall forthwith sell, assign, transfer and convey to Junior Claimant
all of their right, title and interest in and to the Credit Documents and all
Liens and other security interests in favor of the Senior Claimants securing the
obligations of Borrower in connection therewith.

         3. CREDIT AGREEMENT AND CREDIT DOCUMENTS. Junior Claimant acknowledges
that it has been provided with a copy of the Credit Agreement and has read and
is familiar with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, including without
limitation Article 7 thereof. Junior Claimant hereby consents to the application
of Project Revenues in accordance with the Credit Agreement, including without
limitation Article 7 thereof, notwithstanding anything in the Subordinated Debt
Documents to the contrary.

         4. TIME OF FILING. Notwithstanding the time of filing, attachment or
recording of any document or other instrument, it is agreed by Junior Claimant
that any liens arising under or pursuant to the Collateral Documents (as defined
in the Credit Documents) shall be senior to any liens arising in favor of Junior
Claimant as part of or relating to the Subordinated Debt Documents; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit Junior Claimant to obtain
any such liens.


                                        4

<PAGE>



         5. WRONGFUL COLLECTIONS. Should any payment on account of, or any
collateral for any part of, the Subordinated Debt be received by Junior Claimant
in violation of this Agreement, such payment or collateral shall be delivered
forthwith to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Senior Claimants by the
recipient for application to Senior Claims, in the form received. Administrative
Agent is irrevocably authorized to supply any required endorsement or assignment
which may have been omitted. Until so delivered, any such payment or collateral
shall be held by the recipient in trust for the Senior Claimants and shall not
be commingled with other funds or property of the recipient.

         6. OWNERSHIP OF SUBORDINATED DEBT; AMENDMENT OF SUBORDINATED DEBT
DOCUMENTS.

                  6.1 Junior Claimant represents and warrants that it is the
lawful owner of the Subordinated Debt and no part thereof has been assigned to
or subordinated or subjected to any other security interest in favor of anyone
other than the Senior Claimants. Junior Claimant agrees that it may not
assign all or any portion of the Subordinated Debt or any of its rights or
remedies under the Subordinated Debt Documents except upon the execution and
delivery to Administrative Agent of an agreement by any such assignee to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement (including provisions relating to
assignment), in form and substance the same as this Agreement, or otherwise as
may be reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.

                  6.2 Without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent
and the Required Banks, the Subordinated Debt Documents may not be amended so as
to have an adverse effect upon the Senior Claims or Borrower's ability to pay
the Senior Claims at any time.

         7. WAIVERS. Administrative Agent and the Senior Claimants are hereby
authorized to demand specific performance of this Agreement, whether or not
Borrower shall have complied with the provisions hereof applicable to it, at any
time when Junior Claimant shall have failed to comply with any provision hereof
applicable to it. Junior Claimant hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on
the adequacy of a remedy at law which might be asserted as a bar to the remedy
of specific performance hereof in any action brought therefor by the Senior
Claimants. Junior Claimant (a) further waives presentment, notice and protest in
connection with all negotiable instruments evidencing Senior Claims or
Subordinated Debt to which Junior Claimant may be a party, notice of the
acceptance of this Agreement by the Senior Claimants, notice of any loan made,
extension granted or other action taken in reliance hereon, and all demands and
notices of every kind in connection with this Agreement, Senior Claims or time
of payment of Senior Claims or Subordinated Debt and (b) hereby assents to any
renewal, extension or postponement of the time of payment of Senior Claims or
any other indulgence with respect thereto, to any increase in the amount of
Senior Claims, to any substitution, exchange or release of collateral therefor
and to the addition or release of any person primarily or secondarily liable
thereon and assents to the provisions of any instrument, security or other
writing evidencing Senior Claims.

         8. SUBROGATION; NO IMPAIRMENT OF BORROWER'S OBLIGATIONS.
Subject to and from and after the payment in full of all Senior Claims and the
irrevocable termination of

                                        5

<PAGE>



Senior Claimants' commitments under the Credit Documents, Junior Claimant shall
be subrogated to the rights of the Senior Claimants to receive payments or
distributions of cash, property or securities of Borrower applicable to the
Senior Claims until all amounts owing on the Subordinated Debt shall be paid in
full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the
Senior Claimants to which Junior Claimant would be entitled but for the
provisions of this Agreement, and no payments paid over by Junior Claimant to
Senior Claimants pursuant to this Agreement shall, as among the Borrower, its
creditors other than the Senior Claimants, and Junior Claimant, be deemed to be
a payment or distribution on account of the Subordinated Debt, it being
understood that the provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the
purpose of defining the relative rights of Junior Claimant and the Senior
Claimants. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair,
as between Borrower and Junior Claimant, the obligation of Borrower, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay to Junior Claimant the principal of and the
premium, if any, and the interest on the Subordinated Debt, and all other
amounts payable by Borrower under the Subordinated Debt Documents, as and when
the same shall become due and payable, or to affect the relative rights of
Junior Claimant and creditors of Borrower other than the Senior Claimants.

         9. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of Junior Claimant under this
Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time any payment in respect of any Senior Claim, or any other payment
to any holder of any Senior Claim in its capacity as such, is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the holder of such Senior Claims upon the
occurrence of any Proceeding, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for,
Borrower or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though
such payment had not been made.

         10. BANKRUPTCY. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as
between the Junior Claimant and Senior Claimant notwithstanding the occurrence
of any Proceeding affecting Borrower.

         11. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrower and Junior Claimant shall execute and
deliver to the Senior Claimants such further instruments and shall take such
further action as the Senior Claimants may at any time or times reasonably
request in order to carry out the provisions and intent of this Agreement.

         12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Neither the Junior Claimant nor the Senior Claimants
shall have a duty to preserve rights against prior parties in any property of
any kind received hereunder. Nothing contained herein shall impose on the Senior
Claimants any duties with respect to any property of Borrower or Junior Claimant
received hereunder.

         13. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one
agreement. In making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to
produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by each of the parties
hereto.


                                        6

         14. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is intended to take effect as a
sealed instrument, shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
executors, administrators, other legal representatives, successors and assigns,
and shall inure to the benefit of the Senior Claimants, their respective
successors and assigns and shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York without reference to principles of conflict of laws (other than Section
5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law). The parties hereto intend and
agree that this Agreement shall remain binding on such parties (other than
Borrower) notwithstanding the termination (except upon the payment in full of
Senior Claims) or unenforceability of this Agreement as against Borrower.

OWNER GUARANTY DATED AS OF ______, 200_ (THE "GUARANTY") PURSUANT TO WHICH
PROJECT OWNER HAS GUARANTEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE OTHER PORTFOLIO
ENTITIES UNDER THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING BORROWER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE
CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS TO WHICH BORROWER IS A PARTY.]

<PAGE>



         D. The Senior Claimants have agreed that Project Owner may enter into
each of the Subordinated Contracts only if Junior Claimant shall join in this
Agreement and Junior Claimant shall subordinate, to the extent and in the manner
hereinafter set forth, all claims and rights in respect of the Subordinated O&M
Costs to all Senior Claims (as defined below) to the extent set forth in this
Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises [PROMISES] and as an
inducement to the Senior Claimants to grant financial accommodations to
Borrower, and in consideration of the granting thereof, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

         1. DEFINITIONS. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning given in the Credit Agreement. As used in
this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following respective
meanings:

                  "Proceeding" means any (a) insolvency, bankruptcy,
receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other
similar proceeding relating to Project Owner, its property or its creditors as
such, (b) proceeding for any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of
Project Owner, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings, (c) assignment for the benefit of creditors of Project
Owner or (d) other marshaling of the assets of Project Owner.

                  "Senior Claims" means (a) the principal of, and premium, if
any, and interest on the Loans under the Credit Agreement (including, without
limitation, any interest accruing thereon at the legal rate after the
commencement of any Proceeding and any additional interest that would have
accrued thereon but for the commencement of such Proceeding) and all other
Obligations of Borrower to any Senior Claimants, whether new existing or
hereafter incurred or created, under or with respect to the Credit Documents and
any related documents; and (b) all other Obligations of Project Owner to the
Senior Claimants, whether now existing or hereafter incurred or created, under
or with respect to the Credit Documents [ADD IF PROJECT OWNER IS NOT BORROWER: ,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE GUARANTY,] and any related documents.

         2. CERTAIN SUBORDINATION TERMS. Until all Senior Claims shall have been
paid in full and the Senior Claimants' commitments irrevocably terminated under
the Credit Documents, and notwithstanding anything in any of the Subordinated
Contracts to the contrary:

                  2.1 Junior Claimant acknowledges that, notwithstanding
anything in any of the Subordinated Contracts to the contrary, Project Owner may
pay to Junior Claimant Subordinated O&M Costs due to Junior Claimant under
Waterfall Level 6 of Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement only if and to the
extent monies are sufficient for the payment thereof pursuant to such Section
7.2. Except as provided in this Section 2.1, Project Owner shall not, directly
or indirectly, make any payment on or in respect of the Subordinated O&M Costs,
and Project

                                        2

<PAGE>



Owner shall not in any event transfer any collateral for any part of, the
Subordinated O&M Costs.

                  2.2 Except for the right to demand and accept payments set
forth in Section 2.1 hereof, Junior Claimant [ADD IF BORROWER IS NOT PROJECT
OWNER: WITH FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION BY BORROWER TO PROJECT OWNER] shall
not demand, sue for, or accept from Project Owner any such payment or
collateral, nor take any other action to enforce or collect upon any such
payment or to enforce its rights, in either case in respect of the Subordinated
O&M Costs, nor set off against obligations owed to Project Owner under any of
the Subordinated Contracts or otherwise against any part of the Subordinated O&M
Costs. Notwithstanding anything in any of the Subordinated Contracts to the
contrary, the failure by Project Owner to pay any Subordinated O&M Costs shall
not under any circumstances, except where the funds are available therefor and
payment is permitted under Section 2.1 hereof, constitute a breach or default
under any of the Subordinated Contracts.

                  2.3 Neither Project Owner nor Junior Claimant shall otherwise
take any action prejudicial to or inconsistent with the Senior Claimants'
priority position over Junior Claimant created by this Agreement.

                  2.4 Each negotiable instrument or promissory note evidencing a
Subordinated O&M Cost or a lien, if any, in respect thereof shall bear a legend
(or otherwise include provisions satisfactory to Administrative Agent) providing
that payment of the Subordinated O&M Costs thereunder and the priority of any
such lien have been subordinated to prior payment of the Senior Claims and the
liens in respect thereof in the manner and to the extent set forth in this
Agreement.

                  2.5 Junior Claimant shall not commence or voluntarily permit
Project Owner to commence or join with any other creditor or creditors of
Project Owner in commencing any Proceeding against Project Owner or any other
Portfolio Entity or member or partner thereof; provided that Junior Claimant
shall not be so restricted with respect to claims arising directly out of
Project Owner's failure to perform its obligations or make any payments of O&M
Costs under any of the Subordinated Contracts other than the Subordinated O&M
Costs. At any general meeting of creditors of Project Owner or in the event of
any Proceeding, if all Senior Claims have not been paid in full at such time,
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Senior Claimants is hereby irrevocably
authorized at any such meeting or in any such Proceeding:

                         2.5.1 to enforce claims comprising the Subordinated O&M
Costs in the name of Junior Claimant, by proof of debt, proof of claim, suit or
otherwise;

                         2.5.2 to collect any assets of Project Owner
distributed, divided or applied by way of dividend or payment as a result of a
Proceeding, or such securities issued, on account of the Subordinated O&M Costs
as a result thereof and apply the same, or the proceeds of any realization upon
the same that the Senior Claimants in their discretion elect to effect, to
Senior Claims until all Senior Claims shall have been paid in full (the Senior
Claimants hereby agreeing to render any surplus as a court of competent
jurisdiction may direct);


                                        3

<PAGE>



                         2.5.3 other than voting claims comprising the
Subordinated O&M Costs, to take generally any action in connection with any such
meeting or proceeding which Junior Claimant might otherwise take in respect of
the Subordinated O&M Costs and claims relating thereto.

         After the commencement of any such Proceeding, Junior Claimant may
inquire of Administrative Agent in writing whether Administrative Agent intends
to exercise the foregoing rights with respect to the Subordinated O&M Costs.
Should Administrative Agent fail, within a reasonable time after receipt of such
inquiry, either to file a proof of claim with respect to the Subordinated O&M
Costs and to furnish a copy thereof to Junior Claimant, or to inform Junior
Claimant in writing that the Senior Claimants intend to exercise their rights to
assert the Subordinated O&M Costs in the manner hereinabove provided, Junior
Claimant may, but shall not be required to, proceed to file a proof of claim
with respect to the Subordinated O&M Costs and take such further steps with
respect thereto, not inconsistent with this Agreement, as Junior Claimant may
deem proper.

                  2.6 In the event that (a) the Senior Claimants foreclose on
any or all of their liens on all or a substantial portion of the assets
constituting one or more of the Projects (or succeed to such assets by way of a
transfer in lieu of foreclosure), and (b) Senior Claimants assume [either/any]
of the Subordinated Contracts in accordance with the terms of the Consent and
Agreement dated as of ___________, 200__ among Junior Claimant, Administrative
Agent and Project Owner (the "Consent") (or enter into a new agreement pursuant
to Section 1(d) of the Consent), then notwithstanding anything in any of the
Subordinated Contracts to the contrary, (i) Project Owner (or any successor or
assign) shall not be obligated to pay the Subordinated O&M Costs, if any, then
due, except as set forth in Section 2.6.1 or 2.6.2, as applicable, (ii) each of
the Subordinated Contracts shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
any such foreclosure (but subject to the terms and conditions thereof), and
(iii) the following shall apply:

                         2.6.1 In the event that the Senior Claimants
(including, for purposes of this Section 2.6.1, their Affiliates) or any of them
become the owners of one or more of the Projects, the Senior Claimants shall
apply to the outstanding balance, if any, of the Subordinated O&M Costs relating
to such Project(s) on (or promptly after) the last day of each calendar quarter
all Project Operating Revenues relating to such Project(s) received in excess of
amounts applied during such quarterly period to (a) the payment or application
of all costs for the operation and maintenance of the project in the nature of
those costs defined as "Senior O&M Costs" payable under Waterfall Level 1 of
Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement, which expenditures shall not be materially
greater than as are consistent with operation of such Project(s) in accordance
with prudent operating practices (as determined with reference to similar
facilities under similar operating conditions), (b) the payment of a return of
and on the investment of the Senior Claimants, whether such investment is in the
form of equity or debt (and whether or not the Senior Claimants have foreclosed
on their liens by way of a partial or full credit bid or otherwise), which
payments shall not be greater than the periodic payments which would have been
payable under the priorities specified in Waterfall Levels 2 through 5 and 8 of
Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement as in effect immediately prior to such
foreclosure, as reasonably determined by the Senior Claimants (assuming for
purposes of calculating such payment that (i) Loans had been extended at the
Base Rate in the amount of the unpaid balance

                                        4

<PAGE>



of all Loans owed to the Senior Claimants immediately prior to the exercise by
such parties of their remedies, (ii) such deemed Loans have not been repaid upon
foreclosure, (iii) such deemed Loans are to be deemed amortized straight line
through the Loan Maturity Date (without giving effect to any acceleration) and
(iv) all outstanding Letters of Credit were fully drawn upon by the respective
LC Beneficiaries immediately prior to foreclosure) and (c) funding of reserves
in an amount which would have been available for the benefit of the Senior
Claimants under Waterfall Level 5 of Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement as in
effect immediately prior to such foreclosure. Upon such foreclosure by the
Senior Claimants, each of the Subordinated Contracts, as applicable, shall be
deemed to be amended to reflect such arrangement.

                         2.6.2 In the event that the Senior Claimants sell one
or more of the Projects to a third party ("New Owner"), the New Owner shall
apply to the outstanding balance, if any, of the Subordinated O&M Costs relating
to such Project(s) on (or promptly after) the last day of each calendar quarter
all Project Operating Revenues relating to such Project(s) received in excess of
amounts applied during such quarterly period to (a) the payment of all costs for
the operation and maintenance of such Project(s) in the nature of those costs
defined as "Senior O&M Costs" payable under Waterfall Level 1 of Section 7.2 of
the Credit Agreement, which expenditures shall not be materially greater than as
are consistent with operation of such Project(s) in accordance with prudent
operating practices (as determined with reference to similar facilities under
similar operating conditions), (b) the periodic payment of fees, interest and
principal as required by the lenders to the New Owner, which payments shall not
be materially greater on an annual basis than such amounts payable by Project
Owner to the Senior Claimants under the Credit Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to foreclosure by the Senior Claimants, as reasonably
determined by the lenders to the New Owner; provided that greater payments shall
be permitted so long as the payment of such excess amounts is subordinated to
the Subordinated O&M Costs and (c) the funding of reserves not materially in
excess of the amounts which would have been available for the benefit of the
Senior Claimants under Waterfall Level 5 of Section 7.2 the Credit Agreement as
in effect immediately prior to such foreclosure. The lenders to such New Owner
shall be deemed to be Senior Claimants hereunder, and the payments specified in
clause (b) and (c) of this Section 2.6.2 shall be deemed to be Senior Claims
under this Agreement. Subject to Junior Claimant's rights under Section ___ of
the _____, Section _______ of the ________ and Section ____ of the _________,
[SECTION REFERENCES RELATING TO JUNIOR CLAIMANT'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE UPON CHANGE
OF CONTROL] Junior Claimant agrees that it will execute and deliver to New
Owner's lenders such new subordination agreement, such amendments to each of the
Subordinated Contracts, and such other instruments, in each case consistent with
the terms of this Agreement, and Junior Claimant shall take such further action,
as the lenders to the New Owner reasonably request in furtherance of this
Section 2.6.2.

         3. CREDIT AGREEMENT. Junior Claimant acknowledges that it has been
provided with a copy of the Credit Agreement and has read and is familiar with
the provisions of the Credit Agreement, including without limitation Article 7
thereof. Junior Claimant hereby consents to the application of Project Revenues
in the order of priority set forth in the Credit Agreement [ADD IF BORROWER IS
NOT PROJECT OWNER: AND GUARANTY], including without limitation Article 7 [OF THE
CREDIT AGREEMENT] [THEREOF], notwithstanding anything in either of the
Subordinated Contracts to the contrary.


                                        5

<PAGE>



         4. TIME OF FILING. Notwithstanding the time of filing, attachment or
recording of any document or other instrument, it is agreed by Junior Claimant
that any liens arising under or pursuant to the Collateral Documents (as defined
in the Credit Documents) shall be senior to any liens arising in favor of Junior
Claimant as part of or relating to either of the Subordinated Contracts.

         5. WRONGFUL COLLECTIONS. Should any payment on account of, or any
collateral for any part of, the Subordinated O&M Costs be received by Junior
Claimant in violation of this Agreement, such payment or collateral shall be
delivered forthwith to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Senior Claimants by
the recipient for application to Senior Claims, in the form received.
Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized to supply any required
endorsement or assignment which may have been omitted. Until so delivered, any
such payment or collateral shall be held by the recipient in trust for the
Senior Claimants and shall not be commingled with other funds or property of the
recipient.

         6. OWNERSHIP OF SUBORDINATED O&M COSTS; AMENDMENT OF SUBORDINATED
CONTRACTS.

                  6.1 Junior Claimant represents and warrants that it is the
lawful owner of the right to receive the Subordinated O&M Costs and no part
thereof has been assigned to or subordinated or subjected to any other security
interest in favor of anyone other than the Senior Claimants. Junior Claimant
shall not assign all or any portion of the Subordinated O&M Costs, its
commitment under, or any of its rights or remedies under, any of the
Subordinated Contracts without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent
and the Required Banks, which may be granted or withheld in their sole
discretion, and in any event only upon the execution and delivery to
Administrative Agent of an agreement by any such assignee to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement (including provisions relating to assignment), in form
and substance the same as this Agreement, or otherwise as may be reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent.

                  6.2 Subject to Section 6.13.1 of the Credit Agreement [ADD IF
BORROWER IS NOT PROJECT OWNER: AND SECTION 3(f) OF THE GUARANTY], Junior
Claimant shall not amend either of the Subordinated Contracts without
Administrative Agent's prior written consent.

         7. WAIVERS. Administrative Agent and the Senior Claimants are hereby
authorized to demand specific performance of this Agreement, whether or not
Project Owner shall have complied with the provisions hereof applicable to it,
at any time when Junior Claimant shall have failed to comply with any provision
hereof applicable to it. Junior Claimant hereby irrevocably waives any defense
based on the adequacy of a remedy at law which might be asserted as a bar to the
remedy of specific performance hereof in any action brought therefor by the
Senior Claimants. Junior Claimant further waives presentment, notice and protest
in connection with all negotiable instruments evidencing Senior Claims or
Subordinated O&M Costs to which Junior Claimant may be a party, notice of the
acceptance of this Agreement by the Senior Claimants, notice of any loan made,
extension granted or other action taken in reliance hereon, and all demands and
notices of every kind in connection with this Agreement, Senior

                                        6

<PAGE>



Claims or time of payment of Senior Claims or Subordinated O&M Costs. Junior
Claimant hereby assents to any renewal, extension or postponement of the time of
payment of Senior Claims or any other indulgence with respect thereto, to any
increase in the amount of Senior Claims, to any substitution, exchange or
release of collateral therefor and to the addition or release of any person
primarily or secondarily liable thereon and assents to the provisions of any
instrument, security or other writing evidencing Senior Claims.

         8. SUBROGATION; NO IMPAIRMENT OF PROJECT OWNER'S OBLIGATIONS. Subject
to and from and after the indefeasible payment in full of all Senior Claims and
the irrevocable termination of Senior Claimants' commitments under the Credit
Documents, Junior Claimant shall be subrogated to the rights of the Senior
Claimants to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities
of Project Owner applicable to the Senior Claims until all amounts owing on the
Subordinated O&M Costs shall be paid in full, it being understood that the
provisions of this Agreement are and are intended solely for the purpose of
defining the relative rights of Junior Claimant and the Senior Claimants;
provided that such rights of subrogation shall be nonexclusive, and shall be
shared with any other subordinated creditor of the Project Owner which has
entered into an agreement with the Administrative Agent providing similar rights
of subrogation. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall
impair, as between Project Owner, its creditors other than the Senior Claimants
and Junior Claimant, the obligation of Project Owner, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to Junior Claimant the principal of and the premium, if
any, and the interest on the Subordinated O&M Costs as and when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Subordinated Contracts, or to affect the relative rights of Junior Claimant and
creditors of Borrower other than the Senior Claimants.

         9. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of Junior Claimant under this
Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time any payment in respect of any Senior Claim, or any other payment
to any holder of any Senior Claim in its capacity as such, is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the holder of such Senior Claims upon the
occurrence of any Proceeding, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for,
Project Owner or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

         10. BANKRUPTCY. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as
between the Junior Claimant and Senior Claimant notwithstanding the occurrence
of any Proceeding affecting Project Owner.

         11. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Project Owner and Junior Claimant shall execute
and deliver to the Senior Claimants such further instruments and shall take such
further action as the Senior Claimants may at any time or times reasonably
request in order to carry out the provisions and intent of this Agreement.

         12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The rights granted to the Senior Claimants
hereunder are solely for their protection and nothing herein contained shall
impose on the Senior Claimants any duties with respect to any property of
Project Owner or Junior Claimant received

                                        7

<PAGE>



hereunder. The Senior Claimants shall have no duty to preserve rights against
prior parties in any property of any kind received hereunder.

         13. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one
agreement. In making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to
produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by each of the parties
hereto.

         14. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is intended to take effect as a
sealed instrument, shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
executors, administrators, other legal representatives, successors and assigns,
and shall inure to the benefit of the Senior Claimants, their respective
successors and assigns and shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York without reference to principles of conflict of laws (other than Section
5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law). The parties hereto intend and
agree that this Agreement shall remain binding on such parties (other than
Project Owner) notwithstanding the termination (except upon the payment in full
of Senior Claims) or unenforceability of this Agreement as against Project
Owner.

<PAGE>



                                    AGREEMENT

                  In consideration of the premises herein, and in order to
induce the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement and to make the advances of
credit pursuant to the terms thereof, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
Pledged Portfolio Entity and Pledgor hereby agree with Administrative Agent for
the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Banks as follows:

         1. DEFINITIONS.

                  1.1 "UCC" shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as the same
may, from time to time, be in effect in the State of New York; provided,
however, in the event that, by reason of mandatory provisions of law, any or all
of the attachment, perfection or priority of the security interest in any
Collateral is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in a
jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the term "UCC" shall mean the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in such other jurisdiction for purposes of
the provisions hereof relating to such attachment, perfection or priority and
for purposes of definitions related to such provisions.

                  1.2 All capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined
herein, shall have the meanings provided in the Credit Agreement. The rules of
interpretation contained in Exhibit A to the Credit Agreement shall apply to
this Agreement.

         2. ASSIGNMENT, PLEDGE AND GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST.

                  2.1 To secure the timely payment and performance of the
Obligations (as defined below), Pledgor hereby assigns and pledges to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Banks, and
grants to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the
Banks a security interest in all the estate, right, title and interest of
Pledgor, now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under any and all of the
following (the "Collateral"):

                  Any and all of Pledgor's [PARTNERSHIP][LIMITED LIABILITY
COMPANY] interest(s), whether now owned or subsequently acquired, in the Pledged
Portfolio Entity, including, without limitation, the certificates representing
such interest(s) and Pledgor's share of (i) all rights to receive all income,
gain, profit, loss or other items allocated or distributed to Pledgor under the
Constituent Agreement; (ii) all rights to receive all income, profit or other
distributions of any nature whatsoever by the Pledged Portfolio Entity with
respect to such interest(s); (iii) all of Pledgor's capital or ownership
interest, including capital accounts, in the Pledged Portfolio Entity, and all
accounts, deposits or credits of any kind with the Pledged Portfolio Entity;
(iv) all of Pledgor's voting rights in or rights to control or direct the
affairs of the Pledged Portfolio Entity; (v) all of Pledgor's right, title and
interest in the Pledged Portfolio Entity, in or to any and all of the Pledged
Portfolio Entity's assets or properties; (vi) all other right, title and
interest in or to the Pledged Portfolio Entity, as such rights are derived from


                                        2

<PAGE>



Pledgor's interest in the Pledged Portfolio Entity; (vii) all claims of Pledgor
for damages arising out of or for breach of or default relating to the
Collateral; and (viii) all rights of Pledgor to terminate, amend, supplement,
modify or waive performance under the Constituent Agreement, to perform
thereunder and to compel performance and otherwise exercise all remedies
thereunder; and (ix) all proceeds of any of the above.

[ADD ANY PARTNER PLEDGE AGREEMENT] [PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT "COLLATERAL" SHALL
NOT INCLUDE ANY CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY DISTRIBUTED TO PLEDGOR FOLLOWING A
DISTRIBUTION MADE PURSUANT TO WATERFALL LEVELS 8 OR 10, AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF
THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.]

                  2.2 If any default by Pledgor under the Constituent Agreement
(a "Constituent Agreement Default") shall occur, Administrative Agent shall, at
its option, be permitted (but shall not be obligated) to remedy any such
Constituent Agreement Default by giving written notice of such intent to the
Pledged Portfolio Entity and Pledgor. Administrative Agent shall have a period
of 60 days after giving such notice in which to cure such Constituent Agreement
Default. In the event that any such Constituent Agreement Default (except
monetary defaults) shall not be reasonably curable within such sixty-day period,
neither the Pledged Portfolio Entity nor any Person acting on behalf of the
Pledged Portfolio Entity, including, without limitation, a general partner of
the Pledged Portfolio Entity, shall exercise any remedies thereunder if
Administrative Agent shall, within such 60-day period, initiate action to cure
such Constituent Agreement Default and proceed diligently to the curing thereof
within 120 days after giving written notice of a Constituent Agreement Default.
Any cure by Administrative Agent of a Constituent Agreement Default shall not be
construed as an assumption by Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of any
obligations, covenants or agreements of Pledgor under the Constituent Agreement,
and, subject to Section 12.13 of the Credit Agreement, neither Administrative
Agent nor any of the Banks shall be liable for any action taken pursuant to this
subsection 2.2 to cure any such Constituent Agreement Default, except as set
forth in Section 12.13 of the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall not be
deemed to release or to affect in any way the obligations of Pledgor under the
Constituent Agreement.

         3. OBLIGATIONS SECURED. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, this Agreement and all of the Collateral secure the payment and
performance when due of all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of
Borrower and each other Portfolio Entity (including Pledgor) to the
Administrative Agent and the Banks pursuant to the Credit Documents (the
"Obligations"); provided, however, the Obligations as defined in this Section 3
shall not include any Obligations relating to or arising from Projects that have
achieved Operation prior to the effective date of this Agreement.

         4. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following events
(each, an "Event of Default," and collectively the "Events of Default"),
whatever the reason for such Event of Default, and whether it shall be voluntary
or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body, shall entitle Administrative Agent to
exercise any and all of its rights and remedies hereunder or at law:


                                        3

<PAGE>



                  4.1 The occurrence (whether as a result of acts or omissions
by the Pledged Portfolio Entity or any other Person) of an Event of Default (as
"Event of Default" is defined under the Credit Agreement or the respective
Credit Document) under the Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents; or

                  4.2 The failure on the part of Pledgor to observe or perform
any covenant contained in this Agreement on its part to be observed or
performed, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days
after Pledgor becomes aware thereof or receives written notice thereof from
Administrative Agent; provided, however, that, if (i) such failure cannot be
cured within such 30 day period, (ii) such failure is susceptible of cure, (iii)
Pledgor is proceeding with diligence and in good faith to cure such failure,
(iv) the existence of such failure has not had and cannot after considering the
nature of the cure be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Borrower and (v) Administrative Agent shall have received an officer's
certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of Pledgor to the effect of clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above and stating what action Pledgor is taking to
cure such failure, then such 30 day cure period shall be extended to such date,

Requirement or Operative Document relating to any Project or any Site have been

assumption of any credit risk, at any broker's board or at public or private
sale, without demand of performance or notice of intention to sell or of time or
place of sale (except such notice which under applicable law cannot be waived)
it being agreed that Administrative Agent may be a purchaser on behalf of the
Banks or on its own behalf at any such sale and that Administrative Agent, any
Bank or any other Person who may be a bona fide purchaser for value and without
notice of any claims of any or all of the Collateral so sold shall thereafter

including any equity of redemption, of Pledgor or the Pledged Portfolio Entity,

under the Constituent Agreement; (vii) secure the appointment of a receiver for
Pledgor without notice to the Pledged Portfolio Entity or Pledgor; or (viii)

under the UCC. If, pursuant to applicable law, prior notice of any such action
is required to be given to Pledgor or the Pledged Portfolio Entity, Pledgor and
the Pledged Portfolio Entity hereby acknowledge and agree that the minimum time
required by such applicable law, or if no minimum is specified, of 10 Banking
Days, shall be deemed a reasonable notice period.

                  7.2 In addition to the foregoing remedies, Administrative
Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any Event of Default and incur
reasonable fees, costs and expenses in doing so, in which event the Pledged

reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by Administrative Agent in
connection with exercising any remedy provided for herein or at law, curing any
Event of Default or any Constituent Agreement Default, performing any of
Pledgor's agreements contained herein or in the Constituent Agreement or in
respect of any part of the Collateral, together with interest thereon (to the
extent permitted by law) computed at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate
from the date on which such costs or expenses are incurred to the date of
payment thereof, shall constitute indebtedness secured by this Agreement and
shall be paid by the Pledged Portfolio Entity to Administrative Agent on demand.

                  7.4 If Administrative Agent shall decide to exercise its right
to sell any or all of the Collateral, and if in the opinion of counsel for the
Administrative Agent it is necessary to have such Collateral, or that portion
thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or otherwise registered or qualified under any federal or


                                        9

<PAGE>



state securities laws or regulations (collectively, the "Securities Laws")
Pledgor and the Pledged Portfolio Entity will execute and deliver, all at
Pledgor's and the Pledged Portfolio Entity's expense, all such instruments and
documents which, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, are necessary to
register or qualify such Collateral, or that portion thereof to be sold, under
the provisions of the Securities Laws. Pledgor and the Pledged Portfolio Entity
will execute and will use best efforts to cause any registration statement
relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of not
less than six months from the date of the first public offering of such
Collateral, or that portion thereof to be sold, and to make all amendments
thereto and/or to any related prospectus or similar document which, in the
reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent, are necessary, all in conformity
with the Securities Laws applicable thereto. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Pledged Portfolio Entity agrees to comply with the provisions
of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any jurisdiction(s) which Administrative
Agent shall reasonably designate and to make available to its security holders,
as soon as practicable, an earnings statement which will satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

                  7.5 So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Pledgor reserves the right to exercise all of its rights under the
Constituent Agreement (except as limited by the Credit Documents) and to receive
all income and other distributions from the Collateral (except as limited by the
Credit Documents).

         8. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; DELAY NOT WAIVER.

                  8.1 No right, power or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to Administrative Agent or the Banks is intended to be exclusive of any
other right, power or remedy, and every such right, power and remedy shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right,
power and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy. Resort to any or all security now or hereafter held
by Administrative Agent, may be taken concurrently or successively and in one or
several consolidated or independent judicial actions or lawfully taken
nonjudicial proceedings, or both.

                  8.2 No delay or omission of Administrative Agent to exercise
any right or power accruing upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall
be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein. Every power and remedy given by this Agreement may be exercised from
time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by Administrative
Agent.

         9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, the proceeds of any sale of or other
realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied: first, to
all fees, costs and expenses incurred by and due and owing to Administrative
Agent and the Banks with respect to the Credit Agreement, the other Credit
Documents or the Collateral Documents; second, to accrued and unpaid interest on
the

                                       10

<PAGE>



Obligations (including any interest which, but for the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts); third, to the principal
amounts of the Obligations outstanding; fourth, to any other Obligations of the
Pledged Portfolio Entity or Pledgor owing to Administrative Agent or the Banks;
and fifth, to or as directed by Pledgor.

         10. CERTAIN CONSENTS AND WAIVERS.

                  10.1 [INSERT IF OTHER OWNERS OF PLEDGED PORTFOLIO ENTITY:
PLEDGOR HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE EXECUTION, BY THE OTHER PARTNER OR PARTNERS IN
THE PLEDGED PORTFOLIO ENTITY, OF AN AGREEMENT SIMILAR TO THIS AGREEMENT IN FAVOR
OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS.
PLEDGOR SPECIFICALLY AGREES THAT SUCH OTHER AGREEMENT MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
ASSIGN OR DELEGATE TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT RIGHTS TO CURE DEFAULTS UNDER THE
CONSTITUENT AGREEMENT, TO EXERCISE VOTING RIGHTS AND OTHER RIGHTS TO MANAGE OR
CONTROL THE PLEDGED PORTFOLIO ENTITY, AND TO ACT AS SUCH OTHER PARTNER'S
ATTORNEY IN FACT IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION OF SUCH
RIGHTS PROVIDED HEREIN AND THAT PLEDGOR WILL RECOGNIZE AND ACCEPT SUCH
ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION AND THE EXERCISE OF SUCH RIGHTS BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTIONS BY OR BUSINESS OF THE PLEDGED PORTFOLIO
ENTITY.]

                  10.2 Pledgor hereby waives, to the maximum extent permitted by
law (i) all rights under any law limiting remedies, including recovery of a
deficiency, under an obligation secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real
property if the real property is sold under a power of sale contained in the
mortgage, and all defenses based on any loss whether as a result of any such
sale or otherwise, of Pledgor's right to recover any amount from any Portfolio
Entity or any other Person, whether by right of subrogation or otherwise; (ii)
all rights under any law to require Administrative Agent to pursue any Portfolio
Entity or any other Person, any security which Administrative Agent may hold, or
any other remedy before proceeding against Pledgor; (iii) all rights of
reimbursement or subrogation, all rights to enforce any remedy that
Administrative Agent or the Banks may have against any Portfolio Entity or any
other Person, and all rights to participate in any security held by
Administrative Agent until the Obligations have been paid and the covenants of
the Credit Documents have been performed in full; (iv) all rights to require
Administrative Agent to give any notices of any kind, including, without
limitation, notices of nonpayment, nonperformance, protest, dishonor, default,
delinquency or acceleration, or to make any presentments, demands or protests,
except as set forth herein or expressly provided in the Credit Agreement; (v)
all rights to assert the bankruptcy or insolvency of any Portfolio Entity or any
other Person as a defense hereunder or as the basis for rescission hereof; (vi)
subject to Section 16 hereof, all rights under any law purporting to reduce
Pledgor's obligations hereunder if the Obligations are reduced; (vii) all
defenses based on the disability or lack of authority of any Portfolio Entity or
any other Person, the repudiation of the Credit Documents by any Portfolio
Entity or any other Person, the failure by Administrative Agent or the Banks to
enforce any claim against any Portfolio Entity or any other Person, or the
unenforceability in whole or in part of any Credit Documents; (viii) all
suretyship and guarantor's defenses generally; (ix) all rights to insist upon,
plead or in any manner whatever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any
appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling of assets, redemption or
similar law, or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which
may delay, prevent or otherwise

                                       11

<PAGE>



affect the performance by Pledgor of its obligations under, or the enforcement
by Administrative Agent of, this Agreement; (x) any requirement on the part of
Administrative Agent or the holder of any of the Notes to mitigate the damages
resulting from any default; and (xi) except as otherwise specifically set forth
herein, all rights of notice and hearing of any kind prior to the exercise of
rights by Administrative Agent upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of an Event of Default to repossess with judicial process or to replevy, attach
or levy upon the Collateral. To the extent permitted by law, Pledgor waives the
posting of any bond otherwise required of Administrative Agent in connection
with any judicial process or proceeding to obtain possession of, replevy,
attach, or levy upon the Collateral, to enforce any judgment or other security
for the Obligations, to enforce any judgment or other court order entered in
favor of Administrative Agent, or to enforce by specific performance, temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, this Agreement or any
other agreement or document between Pledgor, Administrative Agent and Banks.
Pledgor further agrees that upon the occurrence and during the continuation of
an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, Administrative Agent may elect
to nonjudicially or judicially foreclose against any real or personal property
security it holds for the Obligations or any part thereof, or to exercise any
other remedy against any Portfolio Entity or any other Person, any security or
any guarantor, even if the effect of that action is to deprive Pledgor of the
right to collect reimbursement from any Portfolio Entity or any other Person for
any sums paid by Pledgor to Administrative Agent or any Bank.

                  10.3 If Administrative Agent may, under applicable law,
proceed to realize its benefits under any of the Credit Documents giving
Administrative Agent a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by any Portfolio
Entity or by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or by nonjudicial
sale or enforcement, Administrative Agent may, at its sole option, determine
which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of the
rights and remedies of Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If, in the
exercise of any of such rights and remedies, Administrative Agent shall forfeit
any of its rights or remedies, including any right to enter a deficiency
judgment against any Portfolio Entity or any other Person, whether because of
any applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, Pledgor
hereby consents to such action by Administrative Agent and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, waives any claim based upon such action, even if
such action by Administrative Agent shall result in a full or partial loss of
any rights of subrogation, indemnification or reimbursement which Pledgor might
otherwise have had but for such action by Administrative Agent or the terms
herein. Any election of remedies which results in the denial or impairment of
the right of Administrative Agent to seek a deficiency judgment against any of
the parties to any of the Credit Documents or Security Documents shall not, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, impair Pledgor's obligation hereunder.
In the event Administrative Agent shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale
or at any private sale permitted by law or the Credit Documents, Administrative
Agent may bid all or less than the amount of the Obligations. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, the amount of the successful bid at any such sale,
whether Administrative Agent or any other party is the successful bidder, shall
be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral and the
difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations
shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations.

         11. THE PLEDGED PORTFOLIO ENTITY'S CONSENT. The Pledged Portfolio

Pledgor, Administrative Agent or otherwise, from time to time in the
Administrative Agent's discretion to take any action and to execute any
instrument to enforce all rights of Pledgor with respect to the Collateral,
including, without limitation, the right to ask, require, demand, receive and
give acquittance for any and all moneys and claims for money due and to become
due under or arising out of the Collateral; to elect remedies thereunder, to
endorse any checks or other instruments or orders in connection therewith; to
vote, demand, receive and enforce Pledgor's rights with respect to the
Collateral; to give appropriate receipts, releases and satisfactions for and on
behalf of and in the name of Pledgor or, at the option of Administrative Agent,
in the name of Administrative Agent, with the same force and effect as Pledgor
could do if this Agreement had not been made; and to file any claims or take any
action or institute any proceedings in connection therewith which Administrative
Agent may reasonably deem to be necessary or advisable; provided, however,
Administrative Agent shall not exercise such rights unless upon the occurrence
and during the continuation of an Event of Default. This power of attorney is a
power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

         13. PERFECTION; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  13.1 Pledgor agrees that from time to time, at the expense of
Pledgor, Pledgor shall promptly execute and deliver all instruments and
documents, and take all action, that may be reasonably necessary, or that
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect the
assignment and security interest granted or intended to be granted hereby or to
enable Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies
hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Pledgor shall (i) deliver the Collateral or any part thereof to
Administrative Agent, as Administrative Agent may request, accompanied by such
duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment as Administrative Agent may
request, and (ii) execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or
amendments thereto, and such other instruments, endorsements or notices, as may
be reasonably necessary or desirable or as Administrative Agent may reasonably
request, in order to perfect and preserve the assignments and security interests
granted or purported to be granted hereby.

                  13.2 Pledgor hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to file
one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto,
relative to all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of Pledgor
where permitted by law.

                  13.3 Pledgor shall, promptly upon request, provide to
Administrative Agent all information and evidence it may reasonably request
concerning the Collateral to enable Administrative Agent to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement.

                  13.4 Pledgor and the Pledged Portfolio Entity shall pay all
filing, registration and recording fees and all refiling, re-registration and
re-recording fees, and all reasonable expenses incident to the execution and
acknowledgment of this Agreement, any assurance, and all federal, state, county
and municipal stamp taxes and other taxes, duties, imports, assessments and
charges arising out of or in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, any agreement supplemental hereto, any financing statements, and any
instruments of further assurance.

                  13.5 To the extent it may do so under applicable law, Pledgor,
for itself, its successors and assigns, agrees that it shall not cast any vote
as an owner in the Pledged Portfolio Entity (i) in favor of the commencement of
a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization,
rehabilitation or other relief with respect to the Pledged Portfolio Entity or
its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter
in effect in any jurisdiction or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the owners of the Pledged
Portfolio Entity or any substantial part of the Pledged Portfolio Entity's
property, (ii) to authorize the Pledged Portfolio Entity to consent to any such
aforesaid relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such
aforesaid official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against
the Pledged Portfolio Entity or (iii) to authorize the Pledged Portfolio Entity
to make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.

                  13.6 Pledgor will take all actions within its power to obtain
like title to and the right to pledge any other property at any time hereafter
pledged by it to Administrative Agent as Collateral hereunder.

                  13.7 Pledgor will pay, before any fine, penalty, interest or
cost attaches thereto, all taxes, assessments and other governmental or
non-governmental charges or levies (other than those taxes that it is contesting
in good faith and by appropriate proceedings, and in respect of which it has
established adequate, reserves for such taxes) now or hereafter assessed, levied
against the Collateral pledged by it hereunder (or against the Collateral in
which Pledgor has granted to Administrative Agent a security interest of first
priority) or upon the Liens for taxes and assessments not then delinquent or
subject to a contest and shall retain copies of, and, upon request, permit
Administrative Agent or any Bank to examine receipts showing payment of any of
the foregoing.

         14. PLACE OF BUSINESS; LOCATION OF RECORDS. Unless Administrative Agent
is otherwise notified under Section 6.10, Pledgor's state of organization is and
will be the state of Delaware and the places of business and chief executive
offices of Pledgor are, and all records of Pledgor concerning the Collateral are
and will be, located at the address set forth on Schedule 4.24 of the Credit
Agreement with respect to Pledgor.


                                       14

         15. CONTINUING ASSIGNMENT AND SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF NOTES.
This Agreement shall create a continuing pledge and assignment of and security
interest in the Collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until
payment in full of the Obligations; (b) be binding upon the Pledged Portfolio
Entity, Pledgor, and their respective successors and assigns; and (c) inure,
together with the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent, to the benefit of
Administrative Agent, the Banks and their respective successors, transferees and
assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent
or any of the Banks may assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of or
interest in the Notes or other evidence of indebtedness held by them to any
other Person to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the Credit
Agreement, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all or an
appropriate part of the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Banks herein
or otherwise. The release of the security interest in any or all of the
Collateral, the taking or acceptance of additional security, or the resort by
Administrative Agent to any security it may have in any order it may deem
appropriate, shall not affect the liability of any person on the indebtedness
secured hereby.

         16. TERMINATION OF SECURITY INTEREST. Upon the indefeasible payment and
performance in full of the Obligations, this Agreement and the security interest
and all other rights granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the
Collateral shall revert to Pledgor. Upon any such termination, Administrative
Agent will return all certificates evidencing ownership interests in the Pledged
Portfolio Entity, and all Ownership Powers executed hereunder, to Pledgor and
will, at Pledgor's expense, execute and, subject to Section 26 hereof, deliver
to Pledgor such documents (including, without limitation, UCC-3 termination
statements) as the Pledged Portfolio Entity or Pledgor shall reasonably request
to evidence such termination.

         17. SECURITY INTEREST ABSOLUTE. All rights of Administrative Agent and
the Banks and the security interests hereunder, and all obligations of Pledgor
hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

                  17.1 Any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
Agreement, any Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating
thereto;

                  17.2 Any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
in any other term of the Obligations (including any increase in the amount
thereof), or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure
from the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document;

                  17.3 Any exchange, surrender, release or non-perfection of any
Collateral, or any release, amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from
any guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations;

                  17.4 Any bankruptcy or insolvency of Pledgor or any other
Person; or


                                       15

<PAGE>



                  17.5 Any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
defense available to, or a discharge of, Pledgor or a third party pledgor.

         18. LIMITATION ON DUTY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT WITH RESPECT TO THE
COLLATERAL. The powers conferred on Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to
protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty on it to
exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its
possession and the accounting for monies actually received by it hereunder,
Administrative Agent shall have no duty with respect to any Collateral.
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral
is accorded treatment that is substantially equivalent to that which
Administrative Agent accords its own property, it being expressly agreed, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, that Administrative Agent shall have no
responsibility for (a) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any
parties with respect to any Collateral, but Administrative Agent may do so and
all expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be part of the Obligations
or (b) taking any action to protect against any diminution in value of the
Collateral.

         19. LIABILITY. Recourse against Pledgor and any other Portfolio Entity
and their respective Affiliates, members, partners, stockholders, officers,
directors and employees under this Agreement shall be limited to the extent
provided in Article 9 of the Credit Agreement.

         20. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; CONSENTS. No amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or consent to any
departure by Pledgor therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the
written concurrence of Administrative Agent, the Pledged Portfolio Entity and
Pledgor.

         21. NOTICES. All notices required or permitted under the terms and
provisions hereof shall be in writing and any such notice shall be effective if
given in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.1 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices to Administrative Agent may be given at the address set forth in such
Section 12.1. Notices to Pledgor or the Pledged Portfolio Entity may be given at
the following addresses:

                                      ---------------------
                                       [ADDRESS]

or such other address as notified by a party pursuant to the terms hereof.

         22. FINANCIAL STATUS. Pledgor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping
itself informed of the financial condition of each other Portfolio Entity and
any and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of any instrument or document
evidencing all or any part of the Obligations and of all other circumstances
bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations or any part thereof that
diligent inquiry would reveal. Pledgor hereby agrees that Administrative Agent
shall have no duty to advise Pledgor of information known to Administrative
Agent regarding such condition or any such circumstances or of any changes or


                                       16

<PAGE>



potential changes affecting the Collateral. In the event Administrative Agent,
in its discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any
such information to Pledgor, Administrative Agent shall be under any no
obligation (i) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business
routine, or reasonable commercial lending practices or (iii) to make any other
or future disclosure of such information to any other information to Pledgor.

         23. MODIFICATION OF OBLIGATIONS. If Administrative Agent shall at any
time or from time to time, with or without the consent of, or notice to,
Pledgor:

                  23.1 Change or extend the manner, place or terms of payment
of, or renew or alter all or any portion of, the Obligations;

                  23.2 Take any action under or in respect of the Credit
Documents in the exercise of any remedy, power or privilege contained therein or
available at law, equity or otherwise, or waive or refrain from exercising any
such remedies, power or privileges;

                  23.3 Amend or modify, in any manner whatsoever, the Credit
Documents;

                  23.4 Extend or waive the time for Pledgor's, any other
Portfolio Entity's or any other Person's performance of, or compliance with, any
term, covenant or agreement on its part to be performed or observed under the
Credit Documents, or waive such performance or compliance or consent to a
failure of, or departure from, such performance or compliance;

                  23.5 Take and hold security or collateral for the payment of
the Obligations, or sell, exchange, release, dispose of, or otherwise deal with,
any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or in which Administrative Agent
has been granted a Lien, to secure any indebtedness associated with the Credit
Documents of Pledgor, any other Portfolio Entity or any other Person to
Administrative Agent;

                  23.6 Release or limit the liability of anyone who may be
liable in any manner for the payment of any amounts under the Credit Documents
owed by Pledgor, any other Portfolio Entity or any other Person to
Administrative Agent;

                  23.7 Modify or terminate the terms of any intercreditor or
subordination agreement pursuant to which claims of other creditors of Pledgor,
any other Portfolio Entity or any other Person are subordinated to the claims of
Administrative Agent under the Credit Documents; or

                  23.8 Apply any sums by whomever paid or however realized to
any amounts owing pursuant to the Credit Documents by Pledgor, any other
Portfolio Entity or any other Person to Administrative Agent in such manner as
Administrative Agent shall determine in its discretion in accordance with the
Credit Documents;

then, subject to Section 16 hereof, neither Administrative Agent nor any Bank
shall incur any liability to Pledgor pursuant hereto as a result thereof and no
such action shall impair or release the obligations of Pledgor under this
Agreement.

<PAGE>



         24. DELIVERY OF COLLATERAL. All certificates or instruments
representing or evidencing the Collateral shall be delivered to and held by or
on behalf of Administrative Agent pursuant hereto. All such certificates or
instruments shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or shall be
accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all
in form and substance acceptable to Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent
shall have the right, at any time in its discretion and without prior notice to
Pledgor, following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, to transfer to or to register in the name of Administrative Agent or
any of its nominees any or all of the Collateral and to exchange certificates or
instruments representing or evidencing Collateral for certificates or
instruments of smaller or larger denominations; provided that Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify Pledgor of any such transfer or registration; but
the failure to provide such notice shall not invalidate the effectiveness of
such transfer or registration provided, further, that once such Event of Default
has been cured, Administrative Agent will promptly transfer to or register in
the name or cause its nominees to transfer to or register in the name Pledgor
all such Collateral. In furtherance of the foregoing, Pledgor shall further
execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an ownership power in the form of
Exhibit A attached hereto with respect to the ownership interest(s) of the
Pledged Portfolio Entity owned by Pledgor that are represented by certificates
or other instruments.

         25. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement, including all matters of
construction, validity, performance and the creation, validity, enforcement or
priority of the lien of, and security interests created by, this Agreement in or
upon the Collateral shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York,
without reference to conflicts of law (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York
General Obligations Law), except as required by mandatory provisions of law and
except to the extent that the validity or perfection of the lien and security
interest hereunder, or remedies hereunder, in respect of any particular
Collateral are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the state of
New York.

         26. REINSTATEMENT. This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any amount received by
Administrative Agent in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by Administrative Agent upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation of Pledgor, the Member or any Portfolio
Entity (including the Pledged Portfolio Entity) or upon the dissolution of, or
appointment of any intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar official
for, Pledgor, any Partner or any Portfolio Entity (including the Pledged
Portfolio Entity) or any substantial part of Pledgor's, any Partner's or any
Portfolio Entities' (including the Pledged Portfolio Entity's) assets, or
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

         27. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and
if any clause or provision shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in
part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect
only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction and shall
not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or
any other clause or provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.

         28. SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. All agreements, representations and
warranties made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Credit Agreement and the making of the Loans and extensions of
credit thereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law
to the contrary, the agreements, representations and warranties of Pledgor set
forth herein shall terminate only upon payment of the Obligations, and the
termination of all Commitments and other obligations of the Banks under the
Credit Documents.

         29. HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE. The headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement

executed in connection herewith, is intended by the parties as a final
expression of their agreement and is intended as a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms and conditions thereof.

         31. TIME. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

         32. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall
together constitute one and the same agreement.

         33. ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event any legal action or proceeding
(including, without limitation, any of the remedies provided for herein or at
law) is commenced to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any provision
hereof, unless Pledgor is the prevailing party, Pledgor shall indemnify each of
Administrative Agent and the Banks for their reasonable attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses incurred therein, and if a judgment or award is entered
in any such action or proceeding, such reasonable attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses may be made a part of such judgment or award.

         34. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. The Banks and Pledgor agree that any legal
action or proceeding by or against Pledgor or with respect to or arising out of
this Agreement, or any other Credit Document or Security Document may be brought
in or removed to the courts of the State of New York, in and for the County of
New York, or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New
York, as Administrative Agent may elect. By execution and delivery of the
Agreement, the Banks and Pledgor accept, for themselves and in respect of their
property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. The Banks and Pledgor irrevocably consent to the service of process out
of any of the aforementioned courts in any manner permitted by law. Nothing
herein shall affect the right of Administrative Agent to bring legal action or
proceedings in any other competent jurisdiction, including judicial or
non-judicial foreclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, service of process
shall not be deemed served or mailed to Administrative Agent or the Banks until
a copy of all matters to be served have be mailed to Latham & Watkins, 701 B
Street, Suite 2100, San Diego, California 92101, Attn: Andrew Singer or such
other Person as Administrative Agent or the Banks may hereafter designate by
notice given pursuant to Section 12.1 of the Credit Agreement. The Banks and
Pledgor further agree that the aforesaid courts of the State of New York and of
the United States

                                       19

<PAGE>



of America shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any claim or
counterclaim of Pledgor based upon the assertion that the rate of interest
charged by the Banks on or under this Agreement, the Loans and/or the other
Credit Documents is usurious. The Banks and Pledgor hereby waive any right to
stay or dismiss any action or proceeding under or in connection with any or all
of the Project, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or Security Document
brought before the foregoing courts on the basis of forum non-conveniens.

         35. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. PLEDGOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY WAIVE
THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED
UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG PLEDGOR AND
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. PLEDGOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS

FUTURE DEALINGS. PLEDGOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT
THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION
WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

OTHER RELEVANT PROVISIONS TO BE AMENDED ACCORDINGLY]

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW THEREFORE, the Undersigned hereby agrees as follows:

         1. The Undersigned acknowledges receipt of the Security Agreement and
consents to the Owner's transfer, assignment, grant of a security interest and
all other provisions described therein, and agrees with Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Banks as follows:

                  (a) Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated)
to exercise all rights and to cure any defaults of Owner under the Contract.
Upon receipt of notice from Administrative Agent, the Undersigned agrees to
accept such exercise and cure by Administrative Agent and to render all
performance due by it under the Contract and this Consent to the Banks. The
Undersigned agrees to make all payments to be made by it under the Contract
directly to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks upon receipt of
Administrative Agent's written instructions.

                  (b) The Undersigned will not, without the prior written
consent of Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld),
(i) cancel or terminate the Contract or suspend performance of its services
thereunder except as provided in the Contract and in accordance with paragraph
1(c) hereof, or consent to or accept any cancellation, termination or suspension
thereof by Owner, (ii) sell, assign or otherwise dispose (by operation of law or
otherwise) of any part of its interest in the Contract, or (iii) amend or modify
the Contract in any material respect. The Undersigned agrees to deliver
duplicates or copies of all notices of default delivered under or pursuant to
the Contract to Administrative Agent promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof.

                  (c) The Undersigned will not terminate the Contract on account
of any default or breach of Owner thereunder without written notice to
Administrative Agent and first providing to Administrative Agent (i) thirty (30)
days from the date notice of default or breach is delivered to Administrative
Agent to cure such default if such default is the failure to pay amounts to the
Undersigned which are due and payable under the Contract or (ii) a reasonable
opportunity, but not fewer than ninety (90) days, to cure such breach or default
if the breach or default cannot be cured by the payment of money to the
Undersigned so long as Administrative Agent or its designee shall have commenced
to cure the breach or default within such ninety (90)-day period and thereafter
diligently pursues such cure to completion and continues to perform any monetary
obligations under the Contract and all other obligations under the Contract are
performed by Owner or Administrative Agent. If possession of the Project is
necessary to

                                        2

<PAGE>

cure such breach or default, and Administrative Agent or its designee(s) or
assignee(s) declare Owner in default and commence foreclosure proceedings,
Administrative Agent or its designee(s) or assignee(s) will be allowed a
reasonable period to complete such proceedings. If Administrative Agent or its
designee(s) or assignee(s) are prohibited by any court order or bankruptcy or
insolvency proceedings from curing the default or from commencing or prosecuting
foreclosure proceedings, the foregoing time periods shall be extended by the
period of such prohibition. The Undersigned consents to the transfer of Owner's
interest under the Contract to the Banks or any of them or a purchaser or
grantee at a foreclosure sale by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure and sale or
by a conveyance by Owner in lieu of foreclosure and agrees that upon such
foreclosure, sale or conveyance, the Undersigned shall recognize the Banks or
any of them or other purchaser or grantee as the applicable party under the
Contract (provided that such Banks or purchaser or grantee assumes the
obligations of Owner under the Contract).

                  (d) In the event that the Contract is rejected by a trustee or
debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or if the
Contract is terminated for any reason other than a default which could have been
but was not cured by Administrative Agent as provided in paragraph 1(c) above,
and if, within forty-five (45) days after such rejection or termination, the
Banks or their successors or assigns shall so request, the Undersigned will
execute and deliver to the Banks a new Contract, which Contract shall be on the
terms and conditions as the original Contract for the remaining term of the
Contract before giving effect to such termination.

                  (e) In the event the Banks or their designee(s) or assignee(s)
elect to perform Owner's obligations under the Contract or to enter into a new
Contract as provided in subparagraph (c) or (d) respectively above, the Banks,
their designee(s) and assignee(s), shall have no personal liability to the
Undersigned for the performance of such obligations, and the sole recourse of
the Undersigned in seeking the enforcement of such obligations shall be to such
parties' interest in the Project.

                  (f) In the event the Banks or their designee(s) or assignee(s)
succeed to Owner's interest under the Contract or enter into a new Contract, the
Banks or their designee(s) or assignee(s) shall cure any defaults for failure to
pay amounts owed under the Contract, but shall not otherwise be required to
perform or be subject to any defenses or offsets by reason of any of Owner's
other obligations under the Contract that were unperformed at such time. The
Banks shall have the right to assign all or a pro rata interest in the Contract
or a new Contract entered into pursuant to subparagraph (d) to [IF CONSENT
RELATED TO A FUNDED PROJECT: A PERSON OR ENTITY TO WHOM THE PROJECT IS
TRANSFERRED][IF CONSENT RELATED TO A TURBINE FUNDING: ANY PERSON OR ENTITY],
provided such transferee assumes the obligations of Owner (or the Banks) under
the Contract. Upon such assignment, Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the
Banks (including their Administrative Agents and employees) shall be released
from any further liability thereunder to the extent of the interest assigned.

                  (g) The warranties provided by the Undersigned under the
Contract shall continue in full force and effect (until the expiration of the
warranty periods set forth in the

                                        3

<PAGE>



Contract) in the event that the Banks or their designee(s) or assignee(s)
succeed to Owner's interest in the Contract (whether by foreclosure, sale or
other assignment) and upon the further assignment or sale of the Contract by the
Banks or their designee(s) or assignee(s).

                  [(h) The Undersigned hereby assigns to Owner (and Owner's
assigns) all its interest in any subcontracts and purchase orders in excess of
$____________ now existing or hereinafter entered into by the Undersigned for
performance of any part of the Undersigned's obligations under the Contract (the
"Subcontracts"). Such assignment shall be effective only upon the occurrence of
a breach or default (after the expiration of any applicable cure period) by the
Undersigned under the Contract or upon the termination of the Contract, and then
only as to those Subcontracts which Owner (or its assigns) at such time accepts
in writing. The Undersigned hereby further assigns to Owner (and Owner's
assigns) all of its rights with respect to any warranties under all
Subcontracts. Each Subcontract hereinafter entered into by the Undersigned shall
contain a consent by the subcontractor thereunder to the foregoing assignments
set forth in this Section 1(h).]

         2. The Undersigned hereby represents and warrants that:

                  (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Undersigned
of the Contract and this Consent has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and does not and will not require any further consents or
approvals which have not been obtained, or violate any provision of any law,
regulation, order, judgment, injunction or similar matters or breach any
agreement presently in effect with respect to or binding on the Undersigned;

                  (b) This Consent and the Contract are legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Undersigned, enforceable against the Undersigned in
accordance with their respective terms;

                  (c) All government approvals necessary for the execution,
delivery and performance by the Undersigned of its obligations under the
Contract have been obtained and are in full force and effect;

                  (d) As of the date hereof, the Contract is in full force and
effect and has not been amended, supplemented or modified;

                  (e) Owner has fulfilled all of its obligations under the
Contract, and there are no breaches or unsatisfied conditions presently existing
(or which would exist after the passage of time and/or giving of notice) that
would allow the Undersigned to terminate the Contract; and

                  (f) The Contract constitutes the only agreement between the
Undersigned and Owner with respect to the matters and interests described
therein.

                     BORROWER'S PROJECT FUNDING CERTIFICATE

            Pursuant to the Credit Agreement (as defined below), the undersigned
hereby certifies on this __ day of _____ 2001 to The Bank of Nova Scotia, as
Administrative Agent under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
dated as of February 15, 2001 (the "Credit Agreement") among Calpine

            1. Attached hereto are true, complete and correct copies of each

and such Project Documents are in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms and all conditions precedent to the respective parties' performances
thereunder required to have been performed by the Funding Date have been
satisfied.

            2. No Portfolio Entity is and, to Borrower's knowledge, no other
party to any Operative Document in existence as of the Funding Date is, or, but
for the passage of time or the giving of notice or both will be, in breach of
any obligation thereunder which is reasonably expected to have Material Adverse
Effect on Borrower or the Project.

            3. Each representation and warranty of Borrower, [INCLUDE IF PROJECT
OWNER IS NOT BORROWER: THE PORTFOLIO ENTITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PROJECT], any
Partner, and Calpine under the Credit Documents and each representation and
warranty of Borrower [INCLUDE IF PROJECT OWNER IS NOT BORROWER: AND THE PROJECT

with respect to the Project is in full force and effect, and except as disclosed
therein, is not subject to appeals or further proceedings or to any unsatisfied
condition that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Borrower or the Project. Borrower has no reason to believe that any Permit
identified in Part II(A) of such Permit Schedule will be obtained at a cost
inconsistent with the applicable Project Budget or with material difficulty or
delay by the time they are needed except where there exists alternative
solutions (the expected cost of which is reflected in the Project Budget) which
will eliminate the need for such Permit.

            All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Credit

                                                                Credit Agreement

                             INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

         Defined terms used in this Exhibit K not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in that certain Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of February 15, 2001, by and among Calpine Construction
Finance Company L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Borrower"), Credit Suisse
First Boston, acting through its New York Branch, as Lead Arranger, Syndication
Agent and Bookrunner, The Bank of Nova Scotia as Lead Arranger, LC Bank and
Administrative Agent ("Administrative Agent"), TD Securities (USA) Inc., as
Co-Arranger and Co-Documentation Agent, CIBC World Markets Corp., as Co-Arranger
and Co-Documentation Agent and the Banks parties thereto.

                  1. With respect to each Project having Initial Contributions,
Funded Project and Funded Turbine, Borrower shall, without cost to the Banks,
maintain or cause to be maintained on its behalf in effect at all times the
types of insurance required by the following provisions together with any other
types of insurance, in form acceptable to Administrative Agent, required
hereunder, with insurance companies rated "A-" or better, with a minimum size
rating of "IX," by Best's Insurance Guide and Key Ratings, (or an equivalent
rating by another nationally recognized insurance rating agency of similar
standing if Best's Insurance Guide and Key Ratings shall no longer be published)
or other insurance companies of recognized responsibility satisfactory to
Administrative Agent, the following insurance coverages until all obligations of
Borrower and the other Portfolio Entities pursuant to the Credit Agreement and
the other Credit Documents have been fully discharged:

                         a. Commercial general liability insurance for such
Project on an "occurrence" policy form or AEGIS claims-first-made form,
including coverage for premises/operations, explosion, collapse and underground
hazards, products/completed operations, broad form property damage, blanket
contractual liability for both oral and written contracts, independent
contractor's and personal injury, for the appropriate Portfolio Entities and for
contractors, with primary coverage limits of no less than $1,000,000 for
injuries or death to one or more persons or damage to property resulting from
any one occurrence and a $ 1,000,000 annual aggregate limit.

                  The commercial general liability policy shall also include a
severability of interest clause and a cross liability clause in the event more
than one entity is "named insured" under the liability policy. Policy exclusions
which are not standard to the commercial general liability coverage form or are
added by manual endorsements or are proposed to be added after the Funding Date
for each Funded Project, that restrict coverage, are to be approved by
Administrative Agent. Work performed by others for the appropriate Portfolio
Entities at any such Project shall not commence until a certificate of insurance
has been delivered verifying coverages outlined above to be in place and naming
Borrower and the other applicable Portfolio Entities as insured or additional
insured and Administrative

Agent as additional insured. Deductibles in excess of $50,000 shall be subject
to review and approval by Administrative Agent.

                         b. Automobile liability insurance, including coverage
for owned, non-owned and hired automobiles for both bodily injury and property
damage and containing appropriate no-fault insurance provisions or other
endorsements in accordance with state legal requirements, with limits of no less

death.

                         c. Worker's compensation insurance and employer's

benefits insurance and such other forms of insurance which Borrower or the other
applicable Portfolio Entities are required by law to provide for any such
Project, providing statutory benefits and other states' endorsement and USL&H
Act coverage and Jones Act (if any exposure exists), covering loss resulting
from injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees of Borrower and the
other applicable Portfolio Entities. Work performed by others for any Portfolio
Entity at any such Project shall not commence until a certificate of insurance
has been delivered verifying coverages outlined above to be in place.

                         d. From the point of groundbreaking for each Project
and through the date of Completion for such Project, builder's risk insurance

but in no event an amount less than the limit necessary to satisfy the other
related Project contracts; (ii) off-site coverage with a per occurrence limit of
$5,000,000 or such higher amount as is sufficient to cover off-site equipment

in (i) above; (v) delay in opening coverage for interest during construction,
debt service and continuing expenses in an amount not less than an 18 month
indemnification period limit, on an "all risk" basis, as set forth in (i)
through (iv) above. Builder's risk insurance shall not contain an exclusion for
freezing, mechanical breakdown, or resultant damage caused by faulty
workmanship, design or materials and shall remain in effect until replaced by
property insurance coverage and boiler and machinery coverage as specified in
Section 1(e) below. All such policies may have deductibles of not greater than
$250,000 per loss; earthquake and flood coverage shall have a deductible of not
greater than $250,000 with the exception of California earthquake (for which the

                 At least 45 days prior to the shipment of equipment for any
Project or Funded Turbine manufactured outside the United States, ocean cargo
coverage shall be secured in an amount not less than the full replacement costs
of the value of equipment shipped. Such coverage shall apply to all equipment
which is valued in excess of $500,000 and has a lead time to replace exceeding
five (5) months. The ocean cargo policy shall attach coverage prior to equipment
departing the premises of the manufacturer and shall continue in force until the
shipment arrives at the applicable Project site including 60 days storage, or is
insured under the builders risk policy. Marine delay in opening or advanced loss
of profits shall be insured in an amount not less than the equivalent of
interest during construction, debt service and continuing expenses subject to an
indemnification period not less than twelve months or such additional time
required to repair/replace the equipment being shipped. The waiting period shall
not exceed 45 days. The ocean cargo policy shall not be subject to cancellation
with the exception of wars and strikes preventing passage to the United States
and nonpayment of premium.

                  Earthquake coverage shall include coverage for movement,
earthquakes, shocks, tremors, landslides, subsidence, volcanic activity,
sinkhole coverage, mud-flow or rock-fall, or any other earth movement, all
whether direct or indirect, approximate or remote or in whole or in part caused
by, contributed to or aggravated by any physical damage insured against by such
policy regardless of any other cause or event that contributes, concurrently or
in sequence, to the loss.

                  Flood coverage shall include, but not be limited to, coverage
for waves, tide or tidal water, inundation, rainfall and/or resulting runoff or
the rising (including the overflowing or breaking boundaries) of lakes, ponds,
reservoirs, rivers, harbors, streams, or other bodies of water, whether or not

                         e. From and after the date of Completion for each such
Project, "all risk" property insurance coverage in the amount not less than the
full replacement value of such Project, including a full replacement cost
endorsement (no co-insurance) with no deduction for depreciation, providing,
without limitation, (i) coverages against loss or damage by fire, lightning,
windstorm, hail, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicles, smoke,
other risks from time to time included under "all risk" or "extended coverage"
policies, earthquake, flood (provided, however, that earthquake and flood
coverage may be subject to an annual aggregate limit of not less than
$100,000,000 with the exception of California (for which the limit shall be as
agreed to by Administrative Agent and Borrower and which in Administrative
Agent's reasonable discretion, after consultation with the Banks, is
commercially feasible), collapse, sinkhole, subsidence and such other perils as
Administrative Agent, after consultation with the Banks and Borrower, may from
time to time require to be insured, with a sublimit of not less than $250,000
for

                                       K-3

<PAGE>



on-site clean-up required as a result of the occurrence of an insured risk; (ii)
off-site coverage with a per occurrence limit of $2,000,000 or such higher
amount as is sufficient to cover off-site equipment for which there have been

transit will be required) with a per occurrence limit of not less than
$2,000,000; and (iv) boiler and machinery coverage on a "comprehensive" basis
including breakdown and repair with limits not less than the full replacement
cost of the insured objects. Property insurance coverage shall not contain an
exclusion for freezing, mechanical breakdown or resultant damage caused by
faulty workmanship, design or materials. Borrower shall also maintain or cause
to be maintained with respect to each such Project, from and after the date of
Completion of such Project, business interruption insurance on an "all risk"
basis as set forth in (i) through (iv) above, in an amount equal to satisfy
policy coinsurance conditions, but not less than the sum of 12 months scheduled
Debt Service attributable to such Project, continuing expenses and profits.
Borrower shall also maintain or cause to be maintained, expediting or extra
expense coverage in an amount not less than $3,000,000. Borrower shall also
maintain or cause to be maintained with respect to each such Project contingent
business interruption insurance on a blanket basis in an amount not less than
six months scheduled Debt Service attributable to such Project and continuing
expenses and profits of such Project. The policy/policies shall include
increased cost of construction coverage, debris removable, and building
ordinance coverage to pay for loss of "undamaged" property which may be required
to be replaced due to enforcement of local, state, or federal ordinances subject
to a sublimit of $10,000,000. All such policies may have deductibles of not
greater than $250,000 per loss with the exception of the combustion turbine
($1,000,000); windstorm if located in a coastal area (2%), earthquake if located
in California (for which the deductible may be 5% of values at risk) and flood
if located in a 100 year zone ($500,000); business interruption coverage shall
have a waiting period of not greater than 45 days. In the event the all risk
property and the boiler and machinery coverage are not written in the same
policy, each policy shall be endorsed to provide a joint loss agreement.

                         f. Umbrella / excess liability insurance of not less
than $50,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate during the construction and
the operation of each such Project. Such coverages shall be on a per occurrence
policy form or AEGIS claims-first-made form and over and above coverage provided
by the policies described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above whose limits
shall apply toward the $50,000,000 limits set forth in this section. The
umbrella and/or excess policies shall not contain endorsements which restrict
coverages as set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, and which are
provided in the underlying policies. The limit applying for each such Project
can be satisfied by insuring multiple Projects under one policy subject to a per
Project aggregate endorsement. If the policy or policies provided under this
paragraph contain(s) aggregate limits applying to other operations of Borrower,
the other applicable Portfolio Entities, the Contractor or the Operator other
than with respect to each individual Project, and such limits are diminished
below $25,000,000 by any incident, occurrence, claim, settlement or judgment
against such insurance which has caused the carrier to establish a reserve,


                                       K-4

<PAGE>



Borrower shall take or cause immediate steps be taken to restore such aggregate
limits or shall provide other equivalent insurance protection for such aggregate
limits.

                         g. Watercraft liability and protection and indemnity,
to the extent exposure exists, in an amount not less than $10,000,000 for all
owned, non-owned and hired watercraft used in connection with the construction
and operation of each such Project. Such coverage can be accomplished under
policies provided pursuant to general liability policies, protection and
indemnity policies or separate watercraft liability policies.

                         h. Aircraft liability, to the extent exposure exists,
in an amount not less than $10,000,000 for all owned, non-owned and hired
aircraft, fixed wing or rotary, used in connection with the operation of each
such Project.

                         i. Such other or additional insurance (as to risks
covered, policy amounts, policy provisions or otherwise) as, under Prudent
Utility Practices, are from time to time insured against for property and
facilities similar in nature, use and location to the Funded Projects which
Administrative Agent may reasonably require.

                         j. All Major Contractors and Major Subcontractors and
the Operator (unless covered under the applicable Portfolio Entities'
insurances) at each such Project shall, prior to performing work at each such
Project site, supply proper evidence of insurance as set forth in paragraphs
1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. above. In addition, excess liability or umbrella liability
limits of not less than $5,000,000 for Major Contractors and Major
Subcontractors and Operators shall be certified. Such insurance, with the
exception of workers compensation, supplied by these parties shall:

                          (i)      add Borrower, applicable Portfolio Entities,
                                   Administrative Agent and the Banks, as
                                   additional insureds;

                          (ii)     be primary as respects insurance provided by
                                   Borrower, applicable Portfolio Entities and
                                   Administrative Agent,

                          (iii)    waive rights of subrogation against
                                   Borrower, applicable Portfolio Entities and
                                   Administrative Agent;

                          (iv)     continue in force until obligations of
                                   Contractors and Subcontractors or the
                                   Operator are fulfilled at each such Project.

                  Contractors and Subcontractors shall be responsible for tools
and equipment brought onto each Project site unless such tools and equipment are
financed by one of the Portfolio Entities; all such financed tools and equipment
shall be covered under the builders risk policy.

                 2. All insurance coverage shall be on a "no coinsurance or self
insurance/replacement cost" basis and in such form (including the form of the
loss payable clauses) as shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent (which
acceptance shall not be

                                       K-5

<PAGE>



unreasonably withheld). Borrower shall submit certified copies of all policies
received pursuant to the requirements of this Exhibit to Administrative Agent
for its review and approval.

                 3. All policies wherein the Banks party to this Agreement have
an insurable interest shall insure the interests of the Banks as well as
Borrower and/or the other applicable Portfolio Entities and all policies, with
the exception of workers compensation insurance, and shall name Administrative
Agent and the Banks as additional insured, unless Administrative Agent and/or
the Banks are named as an insured under the policy. All policies covering real
or personal property or business interruption shall name Administrative Agent or
its assigns as First Loss Payee in accordance with Lender's Loss Payable
Endorsement 438 BFU or equivalent and shall provide that any payment thereunder
for any loss or damage with respect to the applicable Project shall be made to
Administrative Agent and paid into the Loss Proceeds Account , except that such
policies may provide that any payments of less than $1,000,000 (not to exceed
$2,000,000 in any year) made in respect of any single casualty or other
occurrence may be paid solely to Borrower, unless Administrative Agent shall
have notified the insurer that an Event of Default or a related Non-Fundamental
Project Default has occurred there under and shall be continuing. Upon payment
and satisfaction of all of Borrower's and the other Portfolio Entities'
obligations under, and termination of, the Credit Documents, Administrative
Agent will instruct the insurers to name Borrower, or such successor credit
provider or other Person as Borrower shall specify, as loss payee. Each policy
shall expressly provide that all provisions thereof, except the limits of
liability (which shall be applicable to all insureds as a group) and liability
for premiums (which shall be solely a liability of the applicable Portfolio
Entities) shall operate in the same manner as if there were a separate policy
covering each such insured. Each policy shall waive subrogation against
Administrative Agent, the Banks, Borrower and the other Portfolio Entities and
shall waive any right of the insurers to any setoff or counterclaim or any other
deduction, whether by attachment or otherwise, in respect of any liability of
Borrower, the other Portfolio Entities or the Banks. Each such policy shall
provide that if any premium or installment is not paid when due, or if such
insurance is to be cancelled, terminated or materially changed for any reason
whatsoever, the insurers (or their representatives) will promptly notify
Borrower and Administrative Agent, and any such cancellation, termination or
change shall not be effective until 30 days after receipt of such notice by
Administrative Agent, and that appropriate certification shall be made to
Borrower by each insurer with respect thereto. Policies of insurance, provided
in accordance with this Exhibit K shall be primary with respect to any other
insurance carried by the Banks.

                 4. In the event that any of the Portfolio Entities (or
Contractor as appropriate) fail to respond in a timely and appropriate manner
(as reasonably determined by Administrative Agent) to take any steps necessary
or reasonably requested by Administrative Agent to collect from any insurers for
any loss covered by any insurance required to be maintained by this Exhibit K,
Administrative Agent shall have the right to make all proofs of loss, adjust all
claims and/or receive all or any part of the proceeds of the

                                       K-6

<PAGE>



foregoing insurance policies, either in its own name or the name of the
applicable Portfolio Entities; provided, however, that the Portfolio Entities
shall, upon Administrative Agent's request and at the Portfolio Entities' own
cost and expense, make all proofs of loss and take all other steps necessary or
reasonably requested by Administrative Agent to collect from insurers for any
loss covered by any insurance required to be obtained by this Exhibit K.

                 5. On or before December 30th of each year, Borrower shall
furnish to Administrative Agent, with a copy for each Bank, a certificate signed
by a Responsible Officer of Borrower or authorized insurance representative,
showing the insurance then maintained by or on behalf of the Portfolio Entities
pursuant to this Exhibit K and stating that such insurance complies in all
material aspects with the terms hereof, together with evidence of payment of the
premiums thereon. In the event that at any time the insurance as herein provided
shall be reduced or cease to be maintained, then (without limiting the rights of
Administrative Agent hereunder in respect of the Event of Default or a related
Non-Fundamental Project Default which arises as a result of such failure)
Administrative Agent may at its option maintain the insurance required hereby
and, in such event, Borrower shall reimburse Administrative Agent upon demand
for the cost thereof together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to
the Default Rate, but in no event shall the rate of interest exceed the maximum
rate permitted by law.

                 6. In the event any insurance (including the limits or
deductibles thereof) hereby required to be maintained, other than insurance
required by law to be maintained and the builder's risk insurance described in
paragraph 1(d) above, shall not be available and commercially feasible in the
commercial insurance market, Administrative Agent, with the approval of the
Insurance Consultant, shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement to waive
such requirement to the extent the maintenance thereof is not so available;
provided, however, that (i) Borrower shall first request any such waiver in
writing, which request shall be accompanied by written reports prepared by an
independent insurance advisor of recognized national standing certifying that
such insurance is not reasonably available and commercially feasible in the
commercial insurance market for electric generating plants of similar type and
capacity (and, in any case where the required amount is not so available,
certifying as to the maximum amount which is so available) and explaining in
detail the basis for such conclusions, such insurance advisers and the form and
substance of such reports to be reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent;
(ii) at any time after the granting of any such waiver, Administrative Agent may
request, and Borrower shall furnish to Administrative Agent within 15 days after
such request, supplemental reports reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent
from such insurance advisers updating their prior reports and reaffirming such
conclusion; and (iii) any such waiver shall be effective only so long as such
insurance shall not be available and commercially feasible in the commercial
insurance market, it being understood that the failure of Borrower to timely
furnish any such supplemental report shall be conclusive evidence that such
waiver is no longer effective because such condition no longer exists, but that
such failure is not the only way to establish such non-existence.


                                       K-7

<PAGE>



                 7. The Portfolio Entities shall at all times maintain or cause
to be maintained the insurance coverage required under the terms of each of the
Project Documents to which they are a party. As a specific, limited exception to
the requirement that insurance be placed with companies of recognized
responsibility as described in 1. above, it is agreed that insurance may be
placed with other insurance companies or self-insured to the extent that the
Person first named insured on such policies of insurance or self-insuring shall
(i) maintain a S&P credit rating of BBB or better, (ii) comply with all other
requirements prescribed by this Schedule, (iii) maintain other insurance or
self-insurance that, in the aggregate, shall at no time exceed 1% of such
Person's net worth and (iv) the applicable Portfolio Entities shall provide
written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent along with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent of appropriate
indemnification of the Portfolio Entities and the Banks by such Person.

                 8. In the event that any policy is written on a "claims-made"
basis and such policy is not renewed or the retroactive date of such policy is
to be changed, Borrower shall obtain or cause to be obtained for each such
policy or policies the broadest basic and supplemental extended reporting period
coverage or "tail" reasonably available in the commercial insurance market for
each such policy or policies and shall provide Administrative Agent with proof
that such basic and supplemental extended reporting period coverage or "tail"
has been obtained.
