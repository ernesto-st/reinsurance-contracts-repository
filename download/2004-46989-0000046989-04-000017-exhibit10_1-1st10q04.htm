in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.&nbsp; Each Person that shall become a Lender or a Participant pursuant to subsection 9.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be

existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the obligations of the Company hereunder and shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.&nbsp; Simultaneously with the making of each such payment by a Lender to
the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent), such Lender shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an amount equal to such payment (excluding the portion of such
payment constituting interest owing to the Issuing Lender) in the related unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest thereon and in the related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against the Company with respect thereto.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Repayment with proceeds of Revolving Loans</u>.&nbsp; On any day on which the Company shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a
Revolving Loan advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been requested or deemed requested by the Company to be made in connection with a drawing under a Letter of
Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan advance, comprised of ABR Loans (or Eurodollar Loans to the extent the Company has complied with the procedures of <u>Section 2.3</u> with respect thereto), shall be immediately made to the Company by all Lenders, as applicable
(notwithstanding any termination of the Commitments pursuant to <u>Section 6.1</u>), <u>pro</u> <u>rata</u> based on their respective Pro Rata Shares (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to <u>Section 6.1</u>) and the
proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Issuing Lender for application to the respective LOC Obligations.&nbsp; Each such Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its Pro Rata Share of each such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such request or deemed
request in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding sentence <u>notwithstanding</u> (i) the amount of such borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any
conditions specified in <u>Section 4.2</u> are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed request for Revolving Loans to be made by the time otherwise required hereunder, (v) whether the
date of such borrowing is a date on which Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi) any termination of the Commitments relating thereto immediately prior to or contemporaneously with such borrowing.&nbsp; In the event that any Revolving
Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws with respect to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries), then each such
Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from the Company on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the Issuing Lender such Participation
Interests in the outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each such Lender to share in such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the respective Pro Rata Shares of such Lenders (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
pursuant to <u>Section 6.1</u>)), <u>provided</u> that at the time any purchase of Participation Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Issuing Lender, to the extent not paid to the Issuing Lender
by the Company in accordance with the terms of subsection (d) above, interest on the principal amount of Participation Interests purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such borrowing would otherwise have occurred but excluding the date of
payment for such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan advance, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the definition of "ABR"), and thereafter at a rate equal to the ABR.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Designation of Consolidated Subsidiaries as Account Parties</u>.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
including without limitation <u>Section 2.14(a)</u>, a Letter of Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of a Consolidated Subsidiary of the Company, provided that notwithstanding such
statement, the Company shall be the actual account party for all purposes of this Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement shall not affect the Company's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Renewal, Extension</u>.&nbsp; The renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as
the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Applicability of ISP98 and UCP</u>.&nbsp; Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Lender and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued,
(i) the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) The
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce ("<u>ICC</u>") at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998
regarding the European single currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.&nbsp;</p>

Company hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify and save each Lender (including the Issuing Lender) harmless from and against, any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) that such Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender or the Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or
omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority that impacts, directly or indirectly, any such Letter of Credit (all such acts or omissions, herein called "<u>Government Acts</u>").</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As between the Company and the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender), the
Company shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof.&nbsp; No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall be responsible:&nbsp; (A) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal
effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the validity or
sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors,
omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (D)&nbsp;for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make
a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (E) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Lender, including, without limitation, any Government Acts.&nbsp; None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting
of the Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions
hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Lender under any resulting liability
to the Company.&nbsp; It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and indemnify each Lender (including the Issuing Lender) against any and all risks involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which
risks are hereby assumed by the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries), including, without limitation, any and all Government Acts.&nbsp; No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall, in any way, be liable for any failure by such
Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of such Lender.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended to limit the reimbursement obligations of
the Company contained in subsection (d) above.&nbsp; The obligations of the Company under this subsection (i) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.&nbsp; No act or omission of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way affect
or impair the rights of the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Agreement.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection (i), the
Company shall have no obligation to indemnify any Lender (including the Issuing Lender) in respect of any liability incurred by such Lender (A) to the extent such liability arose out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender, as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by a final non-appealable judgment, or (B) caused by such Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final non-appealable judgment, unless such payment is prohibited by any law, regulation, court order or decree.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Responsibility of Issuing Lender</u>.&nbsp; It is expressly understood and agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder to the
Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this Agreement and that the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set forth in <u>Section 4.2</u> have been satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge that any such
condition precedent has not been satisfied; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that nothing set forth in this <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u> shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such Lender to
the Issuing Lender pursuant to this <u>Section 2.14</u> in the event that it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit constituted gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of
the Issuing Lender.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Term B Loan Commitment</u>.&nbsp; Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein each Lender severally agrees to make available to the Company on the Closing Date such Lenders' Pro Rata Share of a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of <b>FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($400,000,000)</b> (the "<u>Term B Loan</u>").&nbsp; The Term B
Loan may consist of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination thereof, as the Company may request.&nbsp; Amounts borrowed under the Term B Loan that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Borrowing Procedures</u>.&nbsp; The Term B Loan must be drawn in a single drawing on the Closing Date and shall be subject to the following

B Loan initially consisting of an ABR Loan, or on (or before) the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date with respect to that portion of the Term B Loan initially consisting of one or more Eurodollar Loans (<u>provided</u> that, in regard to Eurodollar Loans,
if the Company submits a notice of borrowing prior to the Closing Date, such notice of borrowing shall be accompanied by a funding indemnity letter in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), which notice of borrowing shall be irrevocable and
shall specify (i) that the funding of the Term B Loan is requested, (ii) whether the funding of the Term B Loan shall be comprised of ABR Loans, Eurodollar Loans or a combination thereof, (iii) if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor, and
(iv) remittance instructions.&nbsp; If the Company shall fail to deliver such notice of borrowing to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 A.M. (New York, New York time) on the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date then the full amount of the Term B Loan shall be
disbursed on the Closing Date as an ABR Loan.&nbsp; Each Lender shall make its Pro Rata Share of the Term B Loan available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Company at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in <u>Section 9.2</u>, or at such
other office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, by 1:00 P.M. (New York, New York time) on the Closing Date in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent.&nbsp; The Term B Loan will then be made available to the Company by the
Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Company as set forth on the notice of borrowing with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Minimum Amounts</u>.&nbsp; Each Eurodollar Loan or ABR Loan that is part of the Term B Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not

<p><b></b></p>

<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Incremental Term Loan</u>.&nbsp; At any time prior to the Incremental Term Loan Availability Expiration Date, subject to the requirements of this <u>Section 2.16</u> and the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein, the Company may propose to incur an Incremental Term Loan in accordance with clause&nbsp;(b) of this <u>Section 2.16</u> in an aggregate amount not to exceed <b>TWO
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ($250,000,000)</b> (the "<u>Incremental Term Loan</u>").&nbsp; Except as otherwise set forth below, the Incremental Term Loan shall have terms identical to the Term&nbsp;B Loan; <u>provided</u> that (i) fees payable to lenders for their
Incremental Term Loan commitments and (ii) interest payable on the Incremental Term Loan will, in each case, be as determined at the time such commitments becomes effective.&nbsp; The Incremental Term Loan may only be incurred (x) so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists at the time of funding or would result therefrom (on a Pro Forma Basis or otherwise) and (y) so long as at the time of funding the Company can demonstrate that the Secured Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 on a Pro Forma Basis.&nbsp;
Amounts borrowed under the Incremental Term Loan that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Procedure for Requesting Incremental Term Loan</u>.&nbsp; If the Company desires to incur the Incremental Term Loan, the Company may request any one or more Lenders, selected by the Company in its sole discretion,
to fund all or any portion of the Incremental Term Loan up to a stated maximum aggregate principal amount and at proposed interest rates and fees for the Incremental Term Loan set forth in such request (<u>provided</u> that such terms shall be in accordance with this
<u>Section 2.16</u> and <u>provided</u> <u>further</u> that the Company shall, concurrently with such request, notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall thereafter notify all Lenders, of such request).&nbsp; Any Lender requested by the
Company to do so may (but is not obligated to) fund all or any portion of the Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp; If Lenders (including Lenders not initially selected by the Company) are not willing to provide all of the Incremental Term Loan requested on the proposed
terms, with the written consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the Company may request one or more Persons meeting the requirements of the definition of "Eligible Assignee" (each a "<u>Prospective Lender</u>"), by
execution of an Incremental Term Loan Acceptance substantially in the form of <u>Exhibit&nbsp;I</u> hereunder, to become a Lender hereunder and to fund all or any portion of the Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp; If one or more Lenders or Prospective Lenders agree to
provide the Incremental Term Loan, the Company shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent specifying the aggregate amount of the Incremental Term Loan to be made, the amount of the Incremental Term Loan to be made by each Lender or Prospective Lender,
based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share, the proposed funding date of the Incremental Term Loan (the "<u>Incremental Term Loan Funding Date</u>") and the interest rates and fees payable with respect to the Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp; The Company and the Administrative
Agent shall agree in writing on all conditions (in addition to those specified in <u>Section 4.2</u> and <u>Section 4.3</u>) to the making of such Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp; Upon the making of the Incremental Term Loan, <u>Section 2.16(d)</u> shall be deemed
amended to provide for the amount and date of the scheduled payments of principal thereon and <u>Section 2.9</u> shall be deemed amended to specify the interest rate or rates applicable to the Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp; The Company shall pay to Administrative Agent
(for distribution to each Lender making the Incremental Term Loan) the fees payable for the Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that the Incremental Term Loan Yield received by any Lender with respect
to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Incremental Term Loan, exceeds the Term B Yield received by any Lender with respect to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Term B Loan by an amount in excess of 0.25% (the amount of such excess, the "<u>Differential Yield
Amount</u>"), the Company shall, in conjunction with the funding of the Incremental Term Loan, (i) increase the margin for Eurodollar Loans with respect to the Term B Loan and the margin for ABR Loans with respect to the Term B Loan (in each case as set forth in
<u>Section 2.9</u>) (it being understood that any such increase of the margin with respect to the Term B Loan shall remain in effect for the term of this Agreement, subject to any additional increase pursuant to this provision), and/or (ii) pay upfront fees to the
Lenders (based on each Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Term B Loan), in an aggregate amount equal to the Differential Yield Amount (taking into account the remaining term to final maturity of the Term B Loan); <u>provided</u> that in any event, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assure that the increase pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be allocated to the margins and upfront fees referred to therein on a substantially similar pro rata basis to the allocation of the Incremental Term Loan Yield to
the Incremental Term Loan Excess Yield and the margin with respect to the Incremental Term Loan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Incremental Term Loan must be drawn in a single drawing on the Incremental Term Loan Funding Date.&nbsp; The Company shall submit an appropriate notice of borrowing, substantially in the form of <u>Exhibit D</u>, to the Administrative Agent not later than

participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document,

outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)&nbsp;any assignment of a Revolving Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Lender and the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); <u>provided</u> that such approval of the Company shall not be required after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default or if such assignment is made in connection with the syndication of the Revolving Commitments by the Administrative Agent or the Syndication Agent; and (iii) the parties to each assignment shall (A) electronically execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (which initially shall be ClearPar, LLC) or (B) manually execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; <u>provided</u> that only one such fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more Approved Funds.&nbsp; Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection&nbsp;(d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
<u>Sections&nbsp;2.12</u>, <u>3.3</u>, <u>3.5</u>, and <u>9.5</u> with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).&nbsp; Upon request, the Company (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee
Lender.&nbsp; Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in <u>Section 9.2</u> a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
register (the "<u>Register</u>") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time.&nbsp; The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of
manifest error, and the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee (and, in the case of an Eligible Assignee
that is not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, by the Company and the Administrative Agent), together with payment by the assigning Lender to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly
accept such Assignment and Assumption and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Company on behalf of the
Company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Credit Party authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Eligible Assignee (each, a "<u>Transferee</u>") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning such Credit Party and its affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or
on behalf of the Company in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Company and its affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement.</p>

<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; <u>provided</u> that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.</p>

<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>

<p>"<u>Eligible Assignee</u>" means (a)&nbsp;a Lender; (b)&nbsp;an Affiliate of a Lender; (c)&nbsp;an Approved Fund; and (d)&nbsp;any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i)&nbsp;the Administrative Agent (and in the case of assignments of Revolving
Commitments) the Issuing Lender, and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of assignments of the Revolving Commitments only (other than in the case of assignments made in connection with the syndication of the Revolving Commitments by the Administrative Agent or the Syndication
Agent), unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); <u>provided</u> that notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Company or any of the
Company's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.</p>

<p>"<u>Fund</u>" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business.</p>

<p>"<u>Approved Fund</u>" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a)&nbsp;a Lender, (b)&nbsp;an Affiliate of a Lender or (c)&nbsp;an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "<u>Granting Lender</u>") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting
Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an "<u>SPC</u>") the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; <u>provided</u> that (i) nothing herein shall constitute
a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.&nbsp; Each party hereto
hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Company under this Agreement (including its obligations under <u>Section
3.3</u>), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification
of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.&nbsp; The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.&nbsp; In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of
any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to
any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such
SPC.</p>

<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee
for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities, <u>provided</u> that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this <u>Section&nbsp;9.6</u>,
(i)&nbsp;no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Credit Documents and (ii)&nbsp;such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Credit Documents even though such trustee may have
acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.</p>

thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in <u>Sections 6(f)</u> or <u>(g)</u>, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to
or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans or Participation Interests, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such
other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each
of the Lenders; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to any Credit Party, any
such notice being expressly waived by each Credit Party to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by such Credit Party hereunder, under the Notes or under any other Credit Document (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any affiliate, branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of such Credit Party. &nbsp; Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Company on
behalf of the respective Credit Party and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender, <u>provided</u> that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.</p>
