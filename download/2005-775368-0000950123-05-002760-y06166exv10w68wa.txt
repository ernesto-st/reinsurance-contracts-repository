     accordance with generally accepted financial practice for the mean of the
     quoted bid and asked yield or rate, and (z) interests in money market funds
     shall have a fair market value equal to their face or par value plus (ii)

     by (iii) the sum of (A) the amount of Taxes reasonably estimated to be

     be incurred if the Closing Assets were sold for their gross fair market
     value as of the Valuation Date and no Section 338 Elections were made, less
     (C) the amount of Taxes reasonably estimated to be saved by the Company in
     any Post-Closing Period (or for any Straddle Period to the extent of the
     reduction in the Taxes allocable to the Purchaser pursuant to Section
     8.5(c)) that would be incurred if the Closing Assets were sold for their
     gross fair market value as of the Valuation Date and no Section 338
     Elections were made (the positive or negative amount in this clause (iii)
     being referred to herein as the "Tax Adjustment") (it being intended that
     the Tax Adjustment shall as nearly as possible equal the amount of the
     deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability, as the case may be, in
     respect of the Closing Assets that would appear on the balance sheet of the
     Company prepared on the Valuation Date and in accordance with generally
     accepted accounting principles (applied without regard to any valuation
     allowance for such deferred tax assets)).

     reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, (i) a
     Material Adverse Effect, (ii) a material adverse effect on the ability of
     Seller to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
     hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) a
     material adverse effect on the ability of Seller or the Company to execute
     and deliver the Related Agreements to which they are a party, to perform
     their respective obligations therein or to consummate the transactions
     contemplated thereby.

fully paid and nonassessable. The Stock constitutes all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company. Seller is the lawful owner,
beneficially and of record, of all of the Stock and has good and valid title to
the Stock, free and clear of all Liens or Restrictions, voting trusts or other
voting agreements, contracts, calls, commitments of any kind, including any such
agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding restricting or otherwise
relating to the voting, dividend rights or dispositions of the Stock. Upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser will
acquire record and beneficial ownership of the Stock, free and clear of any
Liens or Restrictions, voting trusts or other voting agreements, contracts,
calls, commitments of any kind, including any such agreement, arrangement,
commitment or understanding restricting or otherwise relating to the voting,
dividend rights or dispositions of the Stock.

Company for the year ended December 31, 2003 (with the accompanying independent

ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004. Subject, in the case of the
quarterly statutory financial statements, to normal recurring year-end
adjustments, the Statutory Financial Statements fairly represent in all material
respects the financial position and the results of operations of the Company as
of and for the respective dates and for periods indicated therein, in accordance
with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Arkansas Insurance
Department, applied on a consistent basis. All books of account of the Company

properties, assets, liabilities and obligations of the Company and are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. The information contained in the
Statutory Financial Statements was prepared in accordance with accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by the Arkansas Insurance Department applied
on a consistent basis and is not inaccurate in any material respect. Except as
disclosed on such Statutory Financial Statements or in the notes thereto, there
has not been any change in the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company during the last 12 months that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has heretofore
delivered to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the Statutory

     the financial position of the Company at the respective dates thereof. The
     Interim Balance Sheets were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
     applied and in a manner consistent with that employed in the Year End
     Balance Sheet dated December 31, 2003 and fairly present in all material
     respects the financial position of the Company at the respective dates
     thereof.

     Knowledge is there, any violation of any Applicable Law relating to the
     operation, conduct or ownership of the business of the Company other than a
     violation which has been resolved and for which no sanction is pending.

     entered into any written or oral understanding or agreement to do any of
     the foregoing and, to Seller's Knowledge, the Company has not

     or the Related Agreements. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11(a), there
     are no judgments, orders, decrees or injunctions of any Governmental Entity
     issued or outstanding against or which affect the Company or any property
     of the Company or any aspect of the business or operation of the Company,

     written agreements and a written description of all such oral agreements
     having been made available to Purchaser), which are or were in force or
     effective at any time during the period from January 1, 2000 through the
     date hereof, to which the Company is or was a party or by which any

Company to engage in any line of business, to compete with any Person, to do
business with any Person or in any location or to employ any Person or (ii)
limiting the ability of any Person to compete with or obtain products or

               (c) Purchaser shall not amend, or allow the Company to amend, any
     Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Period. Purchaser shall, or
     shall cause the Company to, pay to Seller the net amount of any refunds for
     Taxes received by the Company or Purchaser after the Closing Date, and
     attributable to Taxes paid by Seller under this Agreement or with respect
     to any Pre-Closing Period, less any Taxes or other costs imposed on the
     Company, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates as a result of receiving or
     claiming such refund, and subject to repayment by Seller in the event that
     Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates is subsequently required
     to return such refund. All such Tax refunds shall be paid within five (5)
     days of receipt by the Company or Purchaser (or within five (5) days of
     request therefor by the Purchaser in the case of a refund required to be
     returned).

               (d) Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare in a manner
     consistent with past practice of the Company and to deliver to Parent or
     Seller all relevant Tax information relating to the Company reasonably
     required to permit Parent or Seller to file or cause to be filed when due
     all Tax Returns pursuant to Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement.

               (e) Purchaser and the Company will provide Seller (and its
     attorneys, accountants and agents) with the right, at reasonable times,
     upon reasonable notice, to have access to, copy and use, any records or
     information that are reasonably available to the Company and that Seller
     deems in its reasonable discretion relevant for the preparation of any Tax
     Returns, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, the filing
     of any claim for a refund of Tax or for the allowance of any Tax credit, or
     any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes
     of the Company for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.
     Purchaser shall retain all books and records provided to it with respect to
     any Tax matters pertinent to the Company, Seller or Parent relating to any
     Pre-Closing Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of
     limitations (and, to the extent


                                       28

<PAGE>

     notified by Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective tax periods.
     Seller shall, or shall cause Parent to, reimburse Purchaser for all
     reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with
     providing such information. Any information obtained pursuant to this
     Section 5.3(e) shall be held in strict confidence and shall be used solely
     in connection with the reason for which it was requested.

               (f) In the case of any income or premium Tax Return for any
     Straddle Period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of the
     completed Tax Return for such taxable period and a schedule apportioning
     the Tax shown on such Tax Return as between Seller and Purchaser and
     specifying the amount due to or from Seller (all computed in accordance
     with Section 8.5(c) hereof), together with such related work papers and
     other documents as Seller shall reasonably request, no later than
     forty-five (45) days before the due date for the filing of such Tax Return.
     Seller and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review
     the Tax Return and schedule received from Purchaser pursuant to the terms
     of this Section 5.3(f). Seller and Purchaser shall consult with one another
     and resolve reasonably and in good faith and in accordance with Applicable
     Law any issues concerning the apportionment required by this Section 5.3(f)
     as a result of the review of any such Tax Return and schedule received from
     Purchaser. Seller shall, or shall cause Parent to, pay the amount of Tax,
     if any, due and owing from Seller to Purchaser no later than five (5) days
     prior to the date of filing of such Tax Return.

               (g) Seller shall cause any Tax sharing agreement or similar
     arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company, on the one hand,
     and Parent or Seller, or any Affiliates of Seller, on the other hand, to be
     either terminated or amended effective as of the Closing Date, so that to
     the extent any such agreement or arrangement relates to the Company after
     the Closing Date, none of Parent, the Company, Seller nor any of their
     respective Affiliates shall have any obligation thereunder to the other,
     whether to make payment or otherwise, under any such agreement or
     arrangement for any past, present or future period.

               (h) Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
     from the date hereof to and including the Closing Date, Seller shall not
     permit the Company to, and shall cause Parent not to permit the Company to,
     without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which shall not be
     unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, directly or indirectly (i)
     make, change or revoke, or permit to be made, changed or revoked, any
     election or method of accounting, with respect to Taxes affecting the
     Company for Post-Closing Tax Periods, except elections made on the
     consolidated federal income tax return of the Parent for periods ending on
     December 31, 2004 and on the Closing Date that are consistent with similar
     elections made for prior tax periods or are as disclosed on Schedule 3.8,
     (ii) enter into, or permit to be entered into, any closing or other
     agreement or settlement with respect to Taxes of the Company affecting or
     relating to Post-Closing Tax Periods, or (iii) enter into any transaction
     or series of transactions other than in the ordinary course of business, or
     take any position on any Tax Return for any taxable period (or portion
     thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date that would have the effect
     of increasing the Company's tax liability for any taxable period (or
     portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

               (i) If (i) Purchaser or the Company receives a written notice
     from any Taxing Authority proposing an audit or other examination of a Tax
     Return of the Company for any


                                       29

<PAGE>

     Pre-Closing Period or (ii) a claim is made or threatened in writing by any
     Taxing Authority that, if successful, may result in an indemnity payment
     under Section 8.1 hereof (each a "Tax Claim"), Purchaser shall promptly
     notify Seller in writing stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim,
     and the amount thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice
     shall not relieve Seller from any liability that it may have on account of
     this indemnification or otherwise, unless and to the extent that Seller is
     materially adversely prejudiced thereby. Seller will have the right, upon
     notification to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of the date Purchaser
     notified Seller of such Tax Claim, to assume at its own expense the control
     of any audit or other defense of any Tax Claim with its own counsel. If
     Seller elects not to control any audit or other defense of a Tax Claim,
     Purchaser shall have the authority to settle such Tax Claim subject to
     Seller's consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
     delayed. Seller's right to control a Tax Claim will be limited to issues in
     respect of which amounts in dispute would be paid by Seller or for which
     Seller would be liable pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof. Purchaser shall
     cooperate in good faith with Seller in contesting any Tax Claim, which
     cooperation shall include providing records and information that are
     reasonably available to the Company and relevant to such Tax Claim. All
     reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Purchaser related to such cooperation
     shall be borne by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Seller shall
     not have the right to control any issue involved in a Tax Claim unless
     Seller first acknowledges in writing its obligation to fully indemnify
     Purchaser for the Taxes asserted in connection with such issue; (ii) no
     settlement or disposition of any Tax Claim shall be made without
     Purchaser's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld, delayed or conditioned); and (iii) Purchaser and Seller shall
     jointly control all proceedings involving any claims for Taxes assessed in
     respect of a Straddle Period, and each party shall bear its own
     out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to such claims.

               (j) Seller, Purchaser and the Company agree that for all income
     Tax purposes, the taxable period of the Company shall be terminated as of
     the close of business on the date of the Closing in accordance with
     Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1) and items of income, gain,
     loss, deduction or credit shall be apportioned based upon a closing of the
     books for Tax purposes in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
     1.1502-76(b) (other than transactions properly allocable thereunder to the
     portion of the day after the Closing shall occur, which shall be treated
     for all federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the
     following day). No elections shall be made under either Treasury Regulation
     Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation of a year's
     items) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) (to ratably
     allocate the items for the month which includes the Closing Date). Seller,
     Purchaser and the Company further agree to, and Seller shall cause Parent
     to, file all Tax Returns, handle the contest of any audit and otherwise act
     for all Tax purposes consistent with the provisions of this Section 5.3(j).

               (k) If the Seller and Purchaser do not make the Section 338
     Elections and in a Post-Closing Period the liability of the Company for any
     income Tax is actually reduced (determined by assuming that all other
     current or prior period (but not including any carryback) losses,
     deductions or credits of the Company or any consolidated, combined, or
     unitary group that includes the Company as a member are used first,
     regardless of any ordering rule in Applicable Law) (the "Tax Savings") by
     reason of any net operating loss carryover of the Company from any
     Pre-Closing Period (a "Pre-Closing NOL"), then, (i) to


                                       30

<PAGE>

the extent that the Tax Savings equals all or any part of the Tax Adjustment
that decreased the amount of the Purchase Price payable to Seller (the "Negative
Tax Adjustment"), Purchaser shall pay the Seller an amount equal to the lesser
of the Tax Savings or the Negative Tax Adjustment, and (ii) to the extent that
the Tax Savings exceeds the Negative Tax Adjustment, then for purposes of
determining the amount of Tax incurred by the Company that reduces a refund due
to Seller pursuant to Section 5.3(c), or increases an Indemnification Payment by
Seller pursuant to Section 8.6(ii), the amount of such Tax Savings in excess of
the Negative Tax Adjustment shall be deemed to offset any Tax described in such
Sections. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating any obligation
on the part of the Company (or any consolidated, combined, or unitary group that
includes the Company as a member) to claim or deduct any Pre-Closing NOL in any
Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period, and if any Pre-Closing NOL shall be
reduced, disallowed or adjusted and such reduction, disallowance or adjustment
results in any loss or repayment of any Tax Savings, the amount of such lost or
repaid Tax Savings (plus any interest thereon or penalties related thereto) up
to the amount of the Negative Tax Adjustment paid to the Seller or applied to
offset any Tax shall be treated and indemnified (pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii)(A)) as Liabilities of the Company for Taxes assessed in respect of a
Pre-Closing Period.

          5.4. Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

               (a) At the request of Purchaser, and subject to the receipt of
     Seller's 338 Payment, Seller agrees to (and agrees to cause Parent to, if
     applicable) join with Purchaser in making a timely and irrevocable election
     pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and, at Purchaser's request,
     any corresponding or analogous election under applicable state, local or
     foreign law (collectively, the "Section 338 Elections").

               (b) Purchaser shall be solely responsible for preparing drafts of
     all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section
     338 Elections, including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 or applicable
     successor form, any similar forms or applicable successor forms under
     applicable state or local income tax laws, and the determination of the
     ADSP (as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of
     the Code) and the allocation of ADSP among the assets of the Company and
     other relevant items (the "Allocation"), valuing the Closing Assets using
     the methodology set forth in Section 2.2 hereof (the "Section 338 Forms").
     Purchaser shall furnish a copy of the draft Section 338 Forms to Seller for
     Seller's review and comment, which Seller agrees to do promptly. Seller
     shall, and if required, Seller shall cause Parent to, cooperate in good
     faith with Purchaser's preparation of the Section 338 Forms, and Seller
     agrees to (and agrees to cause Parent to) promptly provide to Purchaser
     true, correct and complete information regarding Seller (or Parent or
     Parent Group, if applicable) reasonably requested by Purchaser and
     necessary to complete the Section 338 Forms.

               (c) Thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for execution
     by Seller (or Parent, if applicable) the final Section 338 Forms. Within
     five (5) days of delivering the final Section 338 Forms to Seller,
     Purchaser shall pay to Seller (by wire transfer in U.S. dollars of
     immediately available funds to the bank account specified in writing by
     Seller to Purchaser) an amount equal to Seller's 338 Payment, and Seller
     agrees to (and agrees to cause Parent to, if applicable) simultaneously
     execute and deliver to Purchaser the final Section 338 Forms.


                                       31

<PAGE>

               (d) If Purchaser has paid Seller's 338 Payment to Seller, then
     Seller agrees that Seller (i) shall (or shall cause Parent to, if
     applicable) report the acquisition of the Company by Purchaser in a manner
     consistent with the making of the Section 338 Elections (ii) shall not, and
     shall cause Parent and each member of Parent Group not to, take a position
     in any Tax Return or audit or any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or
     otherwise inconsistent with the Section 338 Elections, including the
     determination of the ADSP and the Allocation shown thereon, unless and to
     the extent required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in
     Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state or local law).

               (e) Purchaser shall bear the costs and expenses of preparing the
     Section 338 Forms and the Allocation

               (f) If Purchaser and Seller make Section 338 Elections with
     respect to Purchaser's acquisition of the Stock, then the Seller's 338
     Payment shall be increased by the amount of the Negative Tax Adjustment or,
     if the Tax Adjustment increased the amount of the Purchase Price payable to
     Seller (the "Positive Tax Adjustment"), the Seller's 338 Payment shall be
     reduced by the amount of the Positive Tax Adjustment.

               (g) The amount of the Seller's 338 Payment, as increased or
     decreased, as the case may be, by the Negative Tax Adjustment or the
     Positive Tax Adjustment paid to the Seller, if any, shall be treated for
     all tax purposes as the payment to Seller of additional purchase price for
     the Stock.

          5.5. Transfer Taxes.  Seller shall cause all appropriate stock
transfer Tax stamps required by New York to be affixed to the certificate or
certificates representing the Stock, and Seller or Purchaser, as required by
Applicable Law, shall cause all other appropriate stock transfer Tax stamps to
be affixed to the certificate or certificates representing the Stock. Seller,
the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, applications or other documents regarding any real
property transfer, transfer gains, sales or other similar transfer Taxes that
become payable in connection with the sale of the Stock (other than the stock
transfer taxes mentioned above) pursuant to this Agreement (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes"). Any Transfer Taxes shown as due on such returns shall be
borne by Purchaser or Seller as required by Applicable Law.

          5.6. Conduct of Business by Purchaser.  Purchaser covenants that it
shall not, and it shall not permit the Company to, take any action that would
cause the Company to incur any liability whatsoever until the day following the
Closing Date including, without limitation, the commencement of operations by
the Company, the hiring of employees or insurance agents for the Company, the
writing of any insurance business by the Company or engaging in any reinsurance
or other business by the Company, amending or modifying any governing document
of the Company or the taking of any other action whatsoever which obligates the
Company to act or omit to act and if Purchaser elects to make the Section 338
Elections, Purchaser shall not, and it shall not permit the Company to, take any
action after the Closing that would cause the purchase of the Stock hereunder to
fail to constitute a "qualified stock purchase" as defined in Section 338(d)(3)
of the Code.


                                       32

<PAGE>

          5.7. Change of Name.  As promptly as practicable after the Closing,
the Company shall change its name so that the Company does not have the word
"Ulico" in its name, and the Company shall cease using the word "Ulico" in any
of its business dealings. Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller with copies of
all documentation effecting such name change, as filed with each applicable
jurisdiction. Further, Purchaser hereby covenants that it will not use the words
"Ulico", "ULLICO", or any derivatives thereof in any of its business dealings,
and that it will not present itself or any of its Affiliates to the public as
being related in any way to Seller or Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
statements by Purchaser and its Affiliates in regulatory documents, public
filings or otherwise that it has purchased the Company from Seller and
disclosures related thereto shall not be deemed to breach the covenant set forth
in this Section 5.7.

          5.8. Disclosure of Confidential Information.  Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective officers and directors
not to, disclose any confidential information of the Company after the date
hereof to any third party, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or
administrative process or, in the written opinion of its counsel, by other
requirements of law. It is acknowledged and agreed that unauthorized use of any
confidential information of the Company would cause irreparable injury
constituting the proper subject of injunctive relief and specific performance,
in addition to providing Purchaser an action for damages.

          5.9. Compliance with Arkansas Insurance Laws.  During the period from
the date hereof to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
to, comply with all of the requirements of Arkansas insurance laws.

          5.10. Notification of Changes.

               (a) Seller shall, after the first notice or occurrence thereof
     but not later than the Closing Date, promptly notify Purchaser in writing
     of any event or the existence of any state of facts that would (i) make any
     of its representations and warranties in this Agreement untrue, (ii)
     reasonably be likely to constitute a Material Adverse Effect, (iii)
     materially impair the ability of Seller to execute, deliver and perform its
     obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
     provisions of Article VIII hereof or (iv) materially impair the ability of
     Parent, Seller, the Company and/or USACC to execute, deliver or perform
     their respective obligations under any of the Related Agreements.

               (b) Purchaser shall, after the first notice or occurrence thereof
     but not later than the Closing Date, promptly notify Seller in writing of
     any event or the existence of any state of facts that would (i) make any of
     its representations and warranties in this Agreement untrue or (ii)
     materially impair the ability of Purchaser to execute, deliver and perform
     its obligations under this Agreement.

          5.11. Acquisition Proposals.  From the date hereof through the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, nor shall Seller permit any of its Affiliates or any of
the officers, directors, employees, representative or agents of Seller or any of
such Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or participate in
any way in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information or
assistance to, or enter into any agreement with, any person or group of persons


                                       33

<PAGE>

(other than Purchaser) concerning any acquisition of an equity interest in, or
in a merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, or disposition of assets
of the Company, or any disposition of any of the securities of the Company
(other than sales of investment securities in its investment portfolio with the
prior written consent of Purchaser) (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"), or assist
or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other
person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing. Seller shall promptly
communicate to Purchaser the terms of any Acquisition Proposal which it or any
such other person may receive.

          5.12. Related Agreements.  On or prior to the Closing Date, (i) Seller
shall, and shall cause the Company to, execute and deliver each of the Quota
Share Agreement, Trust Agreement and Assumption Agreement, (ii) Seller shall,
and shall cause the Company and USACC to, execute and deliver the Amended
Termination of Reinsurance Pooling Agreement and (iii) Seller shall cause the
Company to execute the Guarantee.

          5.13. Payment of Brokers' or Finders' Fees.  At or prior to the
Closing, Seller will pay the finder's fee due to Merger and Acquisition
Services, Inc.

          5.14. Preparation of Financial Statements.  With respect to any period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which Statutory Financial Statements
are required to be filed (including without limitation the year ended December
31, 2004), Seller shall prepare, on a basis consistent with past practices, all
Statutory Financial Statements of the Company, and Seller shall promptly provide
to Purchaser, at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the due date,
including any extensions, for the filing thereof, such Statutory Financial
Statements together with such other information reasonably relevant to such
Statutory Financial Statements, including schedules and work papers. Following
receipt of any Statutory Financial Statements prepared by Seller, Purchaser
shall promptly notify Seller if it disputes any of the information contained in
such Statutory Financial Statements. The parties shall cooperate to promptly
resolve any such dispute. Subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall provide
Purchaser with such assistance in the preparation of Statutory Financial
Statements of the Company as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser or the
Company. Subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall also provide to Purchaser such
information as may reasonably be required by Purchaser in connection with
Purchaser's preparation of GAAP financial statements for the financial reporting
period in which the Closing occurs and for subsequent reporting periods.

          5.15. Filing Fees.  (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall have paid all remaining Filing Fees due for calendar year 2004. At or
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser an updated
Schedule 3.9(b) indicating the amounts and dates (whether before or after the
date hereof) on which all such Filing Fees for calendar year 2004 were paid and
shall deliver to Purchaser satisfactory evidence thereof.

          (b) The parties agree that the filing fees which will be due for the
calendar year 2005 (the "2005 Filing Fees") shall be allocated between the
Seller and Purchaser in accordance with this Section 5.15(b) and that such
allocation shall be binding on the parties regardless of the actual amount of
the 2005 Filing Fees and regardless of when such 2005 Filing Fees are actually
paid. First, the parties hereto stipulate and agree that the total amount used
to calculate 2005 Filing Fees for purposes of this Section 5.15(b) shall be the
aggregate amount of Filing Fees for calendar year 2004 as shown on Schedule
3.9(b) (i.e., as of the date of this Agreement,


                                       34

<PAGE>

$19,825.95). Next, it is agreed that one-fourth of such aggregate amount of
Filing Fees (i.e., as of the date of this Agreement, $4,956.48) shall be
chargeable to the Seller and three-fourths of such Filing Fees shall be
chargeable to the Purchaser as follows: From the amount equal to one-fourth of
the 2005 Filing Fees shall be deducted all amounts actually paid by the Company
prior to the Closing Date. If the resulting balance is less than zero, such
negative balance shall considered a prepaid expense and shall be reimbursed by
Purchaser to Seller on the Closing Date. If the resulting balance is positive,
such amount shall be considered an unpaid expense as of the Closing Date and
shall be offset against the Purchase Price. The foregoing adjustments shall
constitute complete settlement between the parties with respect to the 2005
Filing Fees, provided, nothing in this Section 5.15(b) shall relieve Seller from
any obligation as otherwise set forth in this Agreement resulting from a breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.9(b).

          5.16. Certain Litigation  With regard to each of the Actions set forth
on Schedule 3.11(b) in which, as of the date of this Agreement, the Company is a
plaintiff, Seller agrees to take, or cause the Company to take, prior to the
Closing, appropriate action such that, at the Closing, the Company shall have
been removed as a plaintiff in each such Action or, if removal is not feasible,
then all of the rights and obligations of the Company in respect of each such
Action shall have been assigned to Seller or an affiliate of Seller, with the
effect that, from and after the Closing, the Company shall have no further
involvement in any of such Actions. Seller further agrees that, from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date, Seller shall not permit the Company to
commence, or to be named as a plaintiff in, any Action other than an Action set
forth on Schedule 3.11(b).

          5.17. Third-Party Reinsurance Agreements

. Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate or take any
other action with respect to any Third-Party Reinsurance Agreement which is
reasonably requested by Purchaser or the Company subsequent to the Closing, and
to provide regular periodic updates as to Seller's efforts to comply with any
such request.

                                   ARTICLE VI

              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING; ABANDONMENT OF THE TRANSACTION

          6.1. Conditions to the Obligations of Purchaser.  Except to the extent

transactions contemplated herein and to purchase the Stock shall be subject to
the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

               (a) The representations and warranties made by Seller contained
     in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects at and
     as of the Closing, as if and to the same effect as though made at and as of
     the Closing Date. Seller shall have performed all of its obligations and
     complied in all material respects with all covenants and conditions
     required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or
     prior to the Closing. Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser a
     certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser, dated the
     Closing Date and signed on its behalf by its President, any Vice President


                                       35

               (i) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
          and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware;

               (ii) all action required on the part of Purchaser to authorize

               (a) By mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

               (b) By Purchaser, if the conditions set forth in Section 6.1
     shall not have been met on or before May 2, 2005; or

               (c) By Seller, if the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 shall
     not have been met on or before May 2, 2005.

          In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant hereto, no
party hereto shall have any liability or obligation to any other party hereto in
respect of this Agreement, except that the provisions of Section 5.1(a)(ii),
Article VII and Section 9.3 shall survive any such termination, and except that
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of any of
its covenants or agreements or willful breach of its representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement or
any obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE VII

          In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement, all further obligations of the parties under
this Agreement shall terminate without further liability of Seller, on the one
hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, to the other, and each party will pay all
of its own costs and expenses incident to the negotiation and preparation of
this Agreement and to its performance of, and compliance with, all agreements
and conditions contained in this Agreement on its part to be performed or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel,
provided that the obligations of the parties under Section 9.3 and the
obligations of Purchaser under Section 5.1(a)(ii) shall survive any such

including the right to recover all expenses, costs and other damages, but no
party shall be entitled to incidental or consequential damages including loss of
anticipated profits. If any of the conditions specified in Section 6.1 have not
been satisfied, Purchaser may, nevertheless, at its election waive such
conditions in writing and proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If any of the conditions specified in Section 6.2 have not been
satisfied, Seller may, nevertheless, at its election waive such conditions in
writing and proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the

          Liabilities arising as a result of a breach of the representations

<PAGE>

               (iii) all Liabilities of the Company arising out of or relating

harmless Seller and its shareholders, Affiliates, subsidiaries, officers,
directors, employees, agents and assigns from and against any Loss actually

     warranty made by Purchaser in the Agreement or any Schedule to this
     Agreement;

               (b) the failure by Purchaser to perform any of the covenants or

          8.3. Notice.  The party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee")
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (the "Indemnitor") if the
Indemnitee believes that it has incurred a Loss for which indemnification may be
asserted under this Article VIII. Such notice shall specify the circumstances of
such asserted Loss and must be given prior to the date recovery of such Loss is
time barred due to the expiration of any period of limitation set forth in
Section 8.7. Failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section 8.3 shall
not be deemed a waiver of the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification other
than to the extent that such failure prejudices the defense of the claim by the
Indemnitor.

          8.4. Determination of Right to Indemnification.  The determination of
the right of an Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement with respect
to any Loss shall be finally determined by Purchaser and Seller jointly;
provided, however, if Purchaser and Seller cannot make such a joint
determination within thirty (30) days from the date on which the notice provided
in Section 8.3 is delivered, either party may commence litigation with respect
to such disagreement in a court in the State of Delaware.

          8.5. Determination of Amount of Indemnification.  The amount of any
asserted Loss for which an Indemnitee seeks indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII shall be finally determined as follows:


                                       42

<PAGE>

               (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, such determination
     shall be made jointly by Purchaser and Seller; provided, however, if
     Purchaser and Seller cannot make such a joint determination within thirty
     (30) days from the date on which the notice provided in Section 8.3 is
     given, either party may commence litigation with respect to such
     disagreement in a court in the State of Delaware.

               (b) In the case of any Loss arising out of or resulting from a
     liability or obligation to, or claim, action or suit by, any party seeking
     monetary relief other than the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall give
     written notice to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after its receipt
     of the notice given pursuant to Section 8.3, that the Indemnitor disputes
     and intends to defend the liability, obligation, claim, action or suit
     giving rise to such Loss or potential Loss. In such event the Indemnitor
     shall have the right to litigate or otherwise contest (at the expense of
     the Indemnitor) such liability, obligation, claim, action or suit with
     counsel selected by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall, in
     any case, cooperate in such litigation or other contest and shall keep each
     other advised of the progress and disposition thereof. The Indemnitor may
     not settle any such Loss without Indemnitee's written consent (which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement (A)
     includes only the payment of money and the execution and delivery of
     appropriate releases including a complete release of the Indemnitee and (B)
     with respect to Taxes, has no adverse or binding effect on the Company for
     any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.
     Upon the final adjudication of any such liability, obligation, claim,
     action or suit, the amount of the Loss attributable thereto shall be then
     determined pursuant to (a) above.

               (c) In the case of any Straddle Period, Seller shall be solely
     responsible for all Taxes of the Company (and that portion of the Company's
     costs for the preparation of each such Tax Return and Tax Audits)
     attributable to the portion of the period ending on, and that includes, the
     Closing Date (other than transactions properly allocable to the portion of
     the day after the Closing), and Purchaser shall be solely responsible and
     shall indemnify Seller for all Taxes imposed on the income or operations of
     the Company and attributable to the portion of the period beginning after
     the Closing Date (including transactions properly allocable to the portion
     of the day after the Closing). For purposes of this Agreement, the portion
     of any Tax that is attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period up to
     and including the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is
     not based on gross or net income, premiums, sales or gross receipts
     (including real property taxes), the total amount of such Tax for the
     period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
     number of days in the Straddle Period through and including the Closing
     Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
     Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax that is based on any of
     gross income, premiums, sales or gross receipts, the Tax that would be due
     with respect to the portion of the Straddle Period through and including
     the Closing Date, if such portion of the Straddle Period were a separate
     taxable period, except that exemptions, allowances, deductions, credits or
     graduated rates that are calculated or applied on an annual basis (such as
     the deduction for depreciation or capital allowances) shall be apportioned
     on the basis of the gross income, premiums, sales or gross receipts for
     each such period, or if not based upon such gross income, premiums, sales
     or gross receipts, then on a per diem basis.

          8.6. Adjustments to Indemnification Amounts.  The amount of any Loss
subject to indemnification under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 shall be (i) reduced
by any insurance

or other recoveries or Tax benefits that the Indemnitee actually receives as a
result of or in connection with such Loss, and (ii) increased by any Taxes such
Indemnitee actually incurs with respect to the indemnification for such Loss
under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, as the case may be.

          8.7. Indemnification Limits.

               (a) Time Limits.  No Indemnitor shall have any obligation to
     indemnify an Indemnitee for any Loss pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section
     8.2(a) unless, on a date not later than the fifth anniversary of the
     Closing Date, the Indemnitee provides notice to the Indemnitor in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3. The foregoing limit shall
     not apply, expressly or by implication, (i) to claims based on the breach,
     failure or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in Sections
     3.1 (Organization and Standing), 3.2 (Insurance Permits), 3.3
     (Authorization of Agreements), 3.4 (Capital Stock of the Company), 3.5
     (Interests in Securities of the Company), 3.8 (Tax Returns and Reports),
     3.16 (Employee Matters), 3.19 (Brokers and Finders), 3.20 (Excess and
     Surplus Lines Brokers), 3.22 (No Restrictions on Business) and 3.23
     (Marketing Agreements), each of which shall survive indefinitely, (ii) to
     claims based on Sections 4.1 (Organization and Standing), 4.2
     (Authorization of Agreement) and 4.6 (Brokers and Finders), each of which
     shall survive indefinitely, (iii) to claims arising under Section 8.1(b) or
     8.1(c), each of which shall survive indefinitely, and (iv) to claims
     arising under Section 8.2(b) or 8.2(c), each of which shall survive
     indefinitely. Each covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall
     survive indefinitely.

               (b) Seller's Maximum Obligation for Certain Claims.  Seller shall
     have no obligation to make payment to an Indemnitee in respect of
     indemnifiable claims made pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) in an amount which,
     when added to the sum of (A) the aggregate amount of payments previously
     paid by Seller in respect of indemnifiable claims made pursuant to Section
     8.1(a)(i) (other than pursuant to the Sections identified in clause (i) of
     Section 8.7(a)) plus (B) the aggregate amount of payments previously paid
     by Seller in respect of Section 2(b)(i) Liabilities, would exceed the
     amount of the Final Purchase Price; provided, however, that such limitation
     on amount of payment set forth in this Section 8.7(b) shall not apply, and
     no limitation shall apply, to limit recovery by an Indemnitee for
     indemnification under Section 3.14 (Undisclosed Liabilities) or under the
     sections of this Agreement referenced in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of
     Section 8.1(a) or clauses (i) or (iii) of Section 8.7(a).

               (c) Purchaser's Maximum Obligation for Certain Claims.  Purchaser
     shall have no obligation to make payment to an Indemnitee in respect of
     indemnifiable claims made pursuant to Section 8.2(a) in an amount which,
     when added to the aggregate amount of payments previously paid by Purchaser
     in respect of such indemnifiable claims made pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
     (other than pursuant to the Sections identified in clause (ii) of Section
     8.7(a)), would exceed the amount of the Final Purchase Price; provided,
     however, that such limitation on amount of payment set forth in this
     Section 8.7(c) shall not apply, and no limitation shall apply, to limit
     recovery by an Indemnitee for indemnification under the sections of this
     Agreement referenced in clauses (ii) or (iv) of Section 8.7(a).

               (d) Indemnification Basket.  Except as hereinafter provided in
     this Section 8.7(d), Seller shall have no obligation to provide
     indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i)


                                       44

<PAGE>

     except to the extent that the aggregate amount of indemnification to which
     Purchaser, but for this Section 8.7(d), otherwise shall have become
     entitled hereunder would exceed $50,000 ("Seller's Basket"), in which
     event, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 8.7(b) above, Seller
     shall be obligated to provide indemnification with respect to all amounts
     in excess of Seller's Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
     this Agreement, Seller shall be obligated to provide indemnification
     pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) without regard to Seller's Basket referred to
     in the immediately preceding sentence in respect of representations and
     warranties made under the sections of this Agreement referenced in Section
     8.7(a)(i).

               (e) Purchaser's Indemnification Basket.  Except as hereinafter
     provided in this Section 8.7(e), Purchaser shall have no obligation to
     provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) except to the extent
     that the aggregate amount of indemnification to which Seller, but for this
     Section 8.7(e), otherwise shall have become entitled hereunder would exceed
     $50,000 ("Purchaser's Basket"), in which event, subject to the limitation
     set forth in Section 8.7(c) above, Purchaser shall be obligated to provide
     indemnification with respect to all amounts in excess of Purchaser's
     Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
     Purchaser shall be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section
     8.2(a) without regard to Purchaser's Basket referred to in the immediately
     preceding sentence in respect of representations and warranties made under
     the sections of this Agreement referenced in Section 8.7(a)(ii).

               (f) No Application to Related Agreements.  For the avoidance of
     doubt, none of the limitations set forth in this Section 8.7 shall in any
     way apply to the liabilities and obligations of the parties under the
     Related Agreements, except as explicitly provided in the Assumption
     Agreement.

          8.8. Single Recovery.  It is the intention of the parties to this
Agreement and the Related Agreements that no party shall make any demand for
payment, indemnification or reinsurance payment with respect to any Loss,
Reinsured Liability or other Liability hereunder or thereunder to the extent
that such payment, indemnification or reinsurance payment would result in the
duplication of recovery to any party (or any Affiliate thereof) to this
Agreement or any Related Agreement in respect of any Loss, Reinsured Liability
or other Liability under this Agreement and/or any Related Agreement.

          8.9. Third Party Beneficiaries.  The Company and all indemnified
parties are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Article VIII.

          8.10. Deemed Adjustment to Purchase Price.  Purchaser and Seller agree
to treat, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, any payments
under this Article VIII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

          8.11. Exclusive Remedy.  Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the indemnification
provisions in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
and the Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated by, and any claims
arising under, this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not,
in any way, be deemed to limit any remedies under any Related Agreement,
including the remedies against Parent under the Guarantee.

                                     GENERAL

          9.1. Amendment and Waiver.  This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented except upon execution and delivery of a written
agreement executed by the parties hereto. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived in writing at any
time by or on behalf of the party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be
binding only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
or shall constitute a waiver of such provision, and no waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver.

          9.2. Integrated Contract.  This Agreement and the Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement (which constitute part of this Agreement) and the
other documents and writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto
(including, without limitation, the Related Agreements) contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

          9.3. Publicity.  From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
parties will consult with each other and will mutually agree by written consent
upon any publication or press release of any nature with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld) and shall not issue any such publication or press release
prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by
Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
securities exchange or any securities exchange regulation, in which case the
party proposing to issue such publication or press release shall use reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such
publication or press release.

          9.4. Governing Law.  This Agreement and the legal relations between
the parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles regarding the choice of
law.

          9.5. Jurisdiction.

               (a) The parties hereto hereby consent and agree that they shall
     commence any action with respect to any claims or disputes between or among
     the parties hereto pertaining to this Agreement or the Related Agreements
     or to any matter arising out of or related to such agreements in the United
     States District Court for the District of Delaware, so long as the action
     falls within the subject matter jurisdiction of such court; in the event
     any such action shall be determined by the court to be outside its subject
     matter jurisdiction, then the parties agree to commence any such action in
     the state courts of Delaware located in New Castle


                                       46

     County. The parties hereto expressly submit and consent in advance to such
     jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in any such court, and hereby
     waive any objection which it may have based upon lack of personal
     jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens and hereby consent to
     the granting for such legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by
     such court. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of
     process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at its
     address given pursuant to Section 9.6 hereof. Subject to the foregoing,
     nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or operate to affect the right of
     Purchaser or Seller to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
     law, or to preclude the enforcement by Purchaser or Seller of any judgment
     or order obtained in the forum specified in this subsection or the taking
     of any action under this Agreement and the Related Agreements to enforce
     the same in any other appropriate forum or jurisdiction.

               (b) To the extent that Purchaser or Seller has or may hereafter
     acquire any immunity from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
     process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment,
     attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to
     such party or such party's property, Purchaser and Seller hereby
     irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of their respective obligations
     under this Agreement and the Related Agreements.

          9.6. Notices.  All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing

States mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid, return receipt requested)
