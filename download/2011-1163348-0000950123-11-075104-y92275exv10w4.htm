conditions of a target award (this &#147;<U>Award</U>&#148;) consisting of restricted stock units that
settle in cash and/or Common Shares (collectively, the &#147;<U>RSUs</U>&#148;), granted to you under the
Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, Third Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan
(the &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>The Plan</U>. This Award is made pursuant to the Plan, the terms and conditions of

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Award</U>. The target number of RSUs subject to this Award (<I>i.e., </I>the Target
Cash-Settled RSUs and Target Share-Settled RSUs) is set forth at the end of this Agreement (this
target number assumes 100% achievement of the Selected Performance Criteria). Each Award
constitutes an unfunded and unsecured promise of Allied World to deliver (or cause to be delivered)

context requires) and/or cash on the settlement date, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
Until such delivery of Shares, except as otherwise provided in Paragraph&nbsp;3, you have only the
rights of a general unsecured creditor, and no rights as a shareholder of Allied World. <B>THIS AWARD
