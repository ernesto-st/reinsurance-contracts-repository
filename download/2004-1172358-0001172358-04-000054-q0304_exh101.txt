     WHEREAS,  management  of each of  Bradley,  the  Partnership  and Sub  have
determined to engage in a business combination, whereby Bradley shall be merged

subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, management of each of the
parties hereto has determined to enter into the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement;

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the

                                   ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1. Merger; Effective Time of the Merger.

     Upon the terms and  subject to the  conditions  of this  Agreement,  at the
Effective Time, Bradley shall be merged with and into Sub in accordance with the
Oklahoma Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the "ORLPA") and the Florida
Limited Liability Company Act ("FLLCA"), and Sub shall continue its existence as
the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity"). At the closing of
the Merger (the "Closing"), certificates of merger, prepared and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the ORLPA and the FLLCA, with respect
to the Merger (the "Certificates of Merger") shall be filed with the Oklahoma
Secretary of State and the Florida Secretary of State. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificates of Merger are duly filed with the

the Partnership and Bradley (the "Effective Time").

    1.2 Closing.

     The  Closing  shall take  place  (i) at  the  offices of  Thompson & Knight
L.L.P., 1700 Pacific Avenue, Suite 3300, Dallas, Texas 75201, at 9:00 a.m.,

in Article 6 is fulfilled or waived (subject to Applicable Law) or is capable of
being fulfilled at the Closing, or (ii) at such other time or place or on such
other date as the parties hereto shall agree; provided, however, that the
parties shall use their

                                       1

<PAGE>

reasonable best efforts to cause the closing to occur prior to or on September
30, 2004. The date on which the Closing is required to take place is herein
referred to as the "Closing Date."

     1.3 Effects of the Merger.

     The Merger shall have the effects specified in the ORLPA and FLLCA, each as
amended. This Agreement shall constitute a plan of merger with respect to the
Merger.

     1.4 Surviving Entity.

     The Certificate of Limited Partnership of Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Limited Partnership of
the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms and
as provided by the ORLPA. The Agreement of Limited Partnership of Sub shall be
the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by the ORLPA. The general
partner of the Surviving Entity is Dorchester Minerals Acquisition GP, Inc. and

     1.5 Merger Consideration and Conversion of Securities.

     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Partnership, Sub, Bradley or any holder of the following
interests, the membership interests in Bradley shall be converted into and
become an aggregate number of Common Units equal to 1,200,000 Common Units (the
"Merger Consideration"). Each member of Bradley at the Effective Time shall
receive a proportionate share of such Common Units, in the same respective
percentages as the membership interests of such member bears to the aggregate
membership interests of all of the members of Bradley. For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, "membership interests" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in the Regulations of Bradley Royalty Partners, L.L.C. dated as of
January 1, 1999, as amended, and in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and shall be determined as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. All
membership interests in Bradley (the "Converted Securities"), when converted as
provided herein, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

     1.6 Exchange Agent; Payment.

     (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Partnership shall designate EquiServe
Trust Company, N.A. (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of payment of the
Merger Consideration.

     (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Partnership will
make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the members of Bradley,
for exchange in accordance with Section 1.6, certificates representing the
number of whole Common Units issuable pursuant to Section 1.5 in exchange for
the Converted Securities. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Partnership
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each member of Bradley
at the Effective Time (i) a certificate representing that number of whole Common
Units that such member has a right to

                                       2
<PAGE>

 receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1 and (ii) a Transfer
Application for use in admission of such members as limited partners in the
Partnership.

     (c) Each holder of Converted  Securities  that have been converted into the
Merger Consideration, upon delivery to the Partnership of a properly completed
Transfer Application, will be admitted into the Partnership as a limited partner
in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Prior to such time, each such
party shall have the rights of an "Assignee" under the Partnership Agreement.

     (d) All Common Units issued as Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such exchanged Converted Securities.

     (e) None of the Partnership, Sub, Bradley, their general partners, their
managers or their transfer agents shall be liable to a member of Bradley for any
amount paid in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable property,
escheat or similar laws.

     (f) No certificates or scrip evidencing fractional Common Units shall be
issued upon the Merger, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to any rights of a limited partner of the Partnership. In lieu of
fractional interests, each member of Bradley shall receive a number of Common
Units rounded to the nearest whole Common Unit, with half Common Units being
rounded up to the nearest whole Common Unit.

     (g)  Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Entity all cash,
certificates and other documents and instruments in its possession relating to
the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Exchange Agent's duties
shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Converted Security shall (subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat, and similar laws) look only to the
Surviving Entity for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration, but such
holder shall have no greater rights against the Surviving Entity than may be
accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Entity under Applicable Law.

     1.7 Dissenting Members.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that dissenters' rights are available in connection with the Merger pursuant to
the FLLCA, each membership interest of Bradley immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a member who has not voted in favor of the Merger and
this Agreement and who complies with all of the relevant provisions of the FLLCA
for the exercise of dissenters' rights shall not be convertible into or
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration. If such member
fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such dissenters' rights, such
holder's membership interests shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration.

                                       3

     1.8 Tax Consequences.

     Bradley, the Partnership, and Sub agree that for federal income tax
purposes the Merger will be treated as a contribution of all of Bradley's assets
and liabilities to the Partnership in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
followed by a liquidating distribution of the Merger Consideration to the
members of Bradley. Bradley will terminate under Section 708 of the Code as a
result of the liquidating distribution.

good standing to do business as a foreign limited partnership in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership,

Adverse Effect.

Partnership Agreement will be, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Partnership and is, and will be, a valid and legally binding agreement,

however, that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

     2.3 Capitalization of the Partnership.

     (a)  All of the outstanding Common Units have been duly authorized  and
