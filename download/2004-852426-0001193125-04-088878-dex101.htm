Landlord&#146;s application of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit or Cash Security Deposit towards the payment of Basic Rent, Additional Rent or the reduction of any damages due Landlord in accordance with Paragraph 23 of this Lease, constitutes a
fair and reasonable use of such proceeds, and (2) the application of such proceeds by Landlord towards the payment of Basic Rent, Additional Rent or any other sums due under this Lease shall not constitute a cure by Tenant of the applicable default
