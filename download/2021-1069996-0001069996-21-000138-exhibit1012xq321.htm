The establishment of the due date shall, for purposes of this Article, be determined as &nbsp;&nbsp;follows: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. As respects the payment of routine deposits and premiums due the Reinsurer, the due &nbsp;&nbsp;date shall be as provided for in the applicable section of this Contract.  In the event a &nbsp;&nbsp;due date is not specifically stated for a given payment, it shall be deemed due 30 days &nbsp;&nbsp;after the date of transmittal by the Intermediary of the initial billing for each such &nbsp;&nbsp;payment. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Any claim or loss payment due the Company hereunder shall be deemed due 10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;after the proof of loss or demand for payment is transmitted to the Reinsurer.  If such &nbsp;&nbsp;loss or claim payment is not received within the 10 days, interest will accrue on the &nbsp;&nbsp;payment or amount overdue in accordance with paragraph B above, from the date the &nbsp;&nbsp;proof of loss or demand for payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. As respects any payment, adjustment or return due either party not otherwise &nbsp;&nbsp;provided for in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of this paragraph C, the due date shall be as &nbsp;&nbsp;provided for in the applicable section of this Contract.  In the event a due date is not &nbsp;&nbsp;specifically stated for a given payment, it shall be deemed due 10 days following &nbsp;&nbsp;transmittal of written notification that the provisions of this Article have been invoked. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of interest calculations only, amounts due hereunder shall be deemed paid &nbsp;&nbsp;upon receipt by the Intermediary. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;D. Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting a Subscribing Reinsurer from &nbsp;&nbsp;contesting the validity of any claim, or from participating in the defense of any claim or suit, &nbsp;&nbsp;or prohibiting either party from contesting the validity of any payment or from initiating any &nbsp;&nbsp;arbitration or other proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.  If the &nbsp;&nbsp;debtor party prevails in an arbitration or other proceeding, then any interest charges due &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder on the amount in dispute shall be null and void.  If the debtor party loses in such &nbsp;&nbsp;proceeding, then the interest charge on the amount determined to be due hereunder shall &nbsp;&nbsp;be calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth above unless otherwise &nbsp;&nbsp;determined by such proceedings.  If a debtor party advances payment of any amount it is &nbsp;&nbsp;contesting, and proves to be correct in its contestation, either in whole or in part, the other &nbsp;&nbsp;party shall reimburse the debtor party for any such excess payment made plus interest on &nbsp;&nbsp;the excess amount calculated in accordance with this Article. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E. Interest charges arising out of the application of this Article that are $1,000 or less from any &nbsp;&nbsp;party shall be waived unless there is a pattern of late payments consisting of three or more &nbsp;&nbsp;items over the course of any 12-month period. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8 - Offset &nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and the Reinsurer may offset any balance or amount due from one party to the &nbsp;&nbsp;other under this Contract or any other contract heretofore or hereafter entered into between the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company and the Reinsurer, whether acting as assuming reinsurer or ceding company.  The &nbsp;&nbsp;provisions of this Article shall not be affected by the insolvency of either party. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1133 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 - Severability of Interests and Obligations &nbsp;&nbsp;The rights, duties and obligations set forth below shall apply as if this Contract were a separate &nbsp;&nbsp;contract between the Subscribing Reinsurers and each named reinsured company: &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;A. Balances payable by any Subscribing Reinsurer to or from any reinsured party under the &nbsp;&nbsp;Contract shall not serve to offset any balances recoverable to, or from, any other reinsured &nbsp;&nbsp;party to the Contract and balances payable shall be separated by named reinsured &nbsp;&nbsp;company and paid directly to the appropriate named reinsured company&#8217;s bank account. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Balances recoverable by any Subscribing Reinsurer to or from any reinsured party under &nbsp;&nbsp;the Contract shall not serve to offset any balances payable to, or from, any other reinsured &nbsp;&nbsp;party to the Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. Reports and remittances made to the Reinsurer in accordance with the applicable articles &nbsp;&nbsp;of the Contract are to be in sufficient detail to identify both the Reinsurer's loss obligations &nbsp;&nbsp;due to each named reinsured company and each named reinsured company's premium &nbsp;&nbsp;remittance under the report.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;D. In the event of the insolvency of any of the parties to the Contract, offset shall be only &nbsp;&nbsp;allowed in accordance with the laws of the insolvent party's state of domicile. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to provide a separate retention, Reinsurer's limit of &nbsp;&nbsp;liability any one loss occurrence or Reinsurer's annual limit of liability for each named &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsured company. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 10 - Access to Records &nbsp;&nbsp;The Reinsurer or its designated representatives shall have access at any reasonable time to all &nbsp;&nbsp;records of the Company which pertain in any way to this reinsurance, provided the Reinsurer &nbsp;&nbsp;gives the Company at least 15 days prior notice of request for such access.  However, a &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscribing Reinsurer or its designated representatives shall not have any right of access to the &nbsp;&nbsp;records of the Company if it is not current in all undisputed payments due the Company.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Undisputed&quot; as used herein shall mean any amount that the Subscribing Reinsurer has not &nbsp;&nbsp;contested in writing to the Company specifying the reason(s) why the payments are disputed. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11 - Errors and Omissions (BRMA 14F) &nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertent delays, errors or omissions made in connection with this Contract or any transaction &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder shall not relieve either party from any liability which would have attached had such &nbsp;&nbsp;delay, error or omission not occurred, provided always that such error or omission is rectified as &nbsp;&nbsp;soon as possible after discovery. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

Amounts paid or received by the Company in any other currency shall be converted to &nbsp;&nbsp;United States Dollars at the rate of exchange at the date such transaction is entered on the &nbsp;&nbsp;books of the Company. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 13 - Taxes (BRMA 50B) &nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the terms under which this Contract is issued, the Company will not claim a &nbsp;&nbsp;deduction in respect of the premium hereon when making tax returns, other than income or &nbsp;&nbsp;profits tax returns, to any state or territory of the United States of America or the District of &nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 14 - Federal Excise Tax (BRMA 17D) &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The Reinsurer has agreed to allow for the purpose of paying the Federal Excise Tax the &nbsp;&nbsp;applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as imposed under Section 4371 of &nbsp;&nbsp;the Internal Revenue Code) to the extent such premium is subject to the Federal Excise &nbsp;&nbsp;Tax. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B.

The Company and the Reinsurer further agree, notwithstanding anything to the &nbsp;&nbsp;contrary in this Contract, that said letters of credit may be drawn upon by the Company or &nbsp;&nbsp;its successors in interest at any time, without diminution because of the insolvency of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company or the Reinsurer, but only for one or more of the following purposes: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.

<DIV style="font-size:xx-small;color:white;width:1500px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1133 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 9 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 16 - Insolvency &nbsp;&nbsp;A. In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of &nbsp;&nbsp;the liability of the Company without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or &nbsp;&nbsp;because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has &nbsp;&nbsp;failed to pay all or a portion of any claim.  It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, &nbsp;&nbsp;conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a &nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in &nbsp;&nbsp;the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate &nbsp;&nbsp;such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be &nbsp;&nbsp;adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its &nbsp;&nbsp;liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the &nbsp;&nbsp;benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by &nbsp;&nbsp;the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Where two or more Subscribing Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in &nbsp;&nbsp;interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in &nbsp;&nbsp;accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by Section 4118(a) of &nbsp;&nbsp;the New York Insurance Law or except (1) where this Contract specifically provides another &nbsp;&nbsp;payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or (2) where the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy &nbsp;&nbsp;obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such &nbsp;&nbsp;policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 17 - Arbitration &nbsp;&nbsp;A. As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or &nbsp;&nbsp;difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually &nbsp;&nbsp;agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One &nbsp;&nbsp;Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall &nbsp;&nbsp;be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active &nbsp;&nbsp;or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's &nbsp;&nbsp;London Underwriters.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an Arbiter within &nbsp;&nbsp;30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may &nbsp;&nbsp;choose two Arbiters who shall in turn choose an Umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If &nbsp;&nbsp;the two Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an Umpire within 30 days following their &nbsp;&nbsp;appointment, each Arbiter shall nominate three candidates within 10 days thereafter, two of &nbsp;&nbsp;whom the other shall decline, and the decision shall be made by drawing lots. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1133 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters within 30 days following the date of &nbsp;&nbsp;appointment of the Umpire.  The Arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable &nbsp;&nbsp;engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial &nbsp;&nbsp;formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Arbiters shall be final and binding on both parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the &nbsp;&nbsp;Umpire and the decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon both parties.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters may be entered in any court of competent &nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdiction. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. If more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscribing Reinsurers shall, at the option of the Company, constitute and act as one party &nbsp;&nbsp;for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of &nbsp;&nbsp;the Subscribing Reinsurers constituting one party, provided, however, that nothing herein &nbsp;&nbsp;shall impair the rights of such Subscribing Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint, &nbsp;&nbsp;defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Subscribing Reinsurers &nbsp;&nbsp;participating under the terms of this Contract from several to joint. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;D. Each party shall bear the expense of its own Arbiter, and shall jointly and equally bear with &nbsp;&nbsp;the other the expense of the Umpire and of the arbitration.  In the event that the two &nbsp;&nbsp;Arbiters are chosen by one party, as above provided, the expense of the Arbiters, the &nbsp;&nbsp;Umpire and the arbitration shall be equally divided between the two parties. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E. Any arbitration proceedings shall take place at a location mutually agreed upon by the &nbsp;&nbsp;parties to this Contract, but notwithstanding the location of the arbitration, all proceedings &nbsp;&nbsp;pursuant hereto shall be governed by the law of the state in which the Company has its &nbsp;&nbsp;principal office. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 18 - Service of Suit (BRMA 49C) &nbsp;&nbsp;(Applicable if the Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America, and/or is not &nbsp;&nbsp;authorized in any State, Territory or District of the United States where authorization is required &nbsp;&nbsp;by insurance regulatory authorities) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A. It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount claimed to be due &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a &nbsp;&nbsp;court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.  Nothing in this Article constitutes or &nbsp;&nbsp;should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an &nbsp;&nbsp;action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a &nbsp;&nbsp;United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by &nbsp;&nbsp;the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which &nbsp;&nbsp;makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby designates the party named in its Interests &nbsp;&nbsp;and Liabilities Agreement, or if no party is named therein, the Superintendent, &nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioner or Director of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the &nbsp;&nbsp;statute, or his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon whom &nbsp;&nbsp;may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on &nbsp;&nbsp;behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

Furthermore, &nbsp;&nbsp;the Reinsurer shall not assert that any Privilege otherwise applicable to the Confidential &nbsp;&nbsp;Information has been waived or otherwise compromised by virtue of its disclosure pursuant &nbsp;&nbsp;to this Contract.   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;G. The provisions of this Article shall extend to the officers, directors and employees of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer and its affiliates, and shall be binding upon their successors and assigns. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 22 - Non-Waiver &nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the Company or Reinsurer to insist on compliance with this Contract or to exercise &nbsp;&nbsp;any right, remedy or option hereunder shall not:  (1) constitute a waiver of any rights contained &nbsp;&nbsp;in this Contract, (2) prevent the Company or Reinsurer from thereafter demanding full and &nbsp;&nbsp;complete compliance, (3) prevent the Company or Reinsurer from exercising such remedy in &nbsp;&nbsp;the future, nor (4) affect the validity of this Contract or any part thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 23 - Agency Agreement (BRMA 73A) &nbsp;&nbsp;If more than one reinsured company is named as a party to this Contract, the first named &nbsp;&nbsp;company shall be deemed the agent of the other reinsured companies for purposes of sending &nbsp;&nbsp;or receiving notices required by the terms and conditions of this Contract, and for purposes of &nbsp;&nbsp;remitting or receiving any monies due any party. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 24 - Notices and Contract Execution &nbsp;&nbsp;A.
