The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after
the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#147;<U>IBA</U>&#148;) for purposes of the
IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the
interest rate on Eurodollar Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the
event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in Section&nbsp;1.10(a) of this Agreement, such Section&nbsp;1.10(a) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of
interest. The Administrative Agent may amend this Agreement together with the Borrower, pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10(a), in advance of or after any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is based. However, the
Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the
definition of &#147;LIBO Rate&#148; or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement
reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10(a), will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate
prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. </P>

<U>Withholding Tax</U>. To the extent required by any applicable Requirements of Law (including for this purpose, pursuant to any agreements entered into with a Governmental Authority), the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any
Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the IRS or any other authority of the United States or other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or
for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that
rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Loan Parties and
