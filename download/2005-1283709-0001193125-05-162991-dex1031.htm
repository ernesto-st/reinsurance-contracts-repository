Mezzanine Financing pursuant to <U>Schedule VI</U> attached hereto which promissory notes may be included in separate sales or securitizations undertaken by Lender. In conjunction with any such action, Lender may redefine the interest rate;
provided, however if Lender redefines the interest rate, the initial weighted average of the interest rates contained in the severed promissory notes taken in the aggregate shall equal the Applicable Interest Rate and all other economic terms shall
remain unchanged in the aggregate. Subject to the foregoing, each severed promissory note, and the Loan evidenced thereby, shall be upon all of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement and the Loan Documents which continue in full force
and effect, except that Lender may allocate specific collateral given for the Loan as security for performance of specific promissory notes, in each case with or without cross default provisions. Borrower, at Borrower&#146;s expense (not including
Lender&#146;s costs and expenses or the costs of Lender&#146;s legal counsel), agrees to cooperate with all reasonable requests of Lender to accomplish the foregoing, including, without limitation, execution and prompt delivery to Lender of a
severance agreement and such other related documents as Lender shall reasonably require. Borrower hereby appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (and which shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and irrevocable

severance; provided, however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power until five (5) Business Days after written notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender&#146;s intent to exercise its rights under such
power. Except as may be required in connection with a Securitization, (i) Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, recording or filing of the severed Loan Documents, and
(ii) the severed Loan Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations and warranties contained in the severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower only as
of the Closing Date. Borrower&#146;s failure to deliver any of the documents requested by Lender hereunder for a period of ten (10) business days after such notice by Lender shall, at Lender&#146;s option, constitute an Event of Default hereunder.
