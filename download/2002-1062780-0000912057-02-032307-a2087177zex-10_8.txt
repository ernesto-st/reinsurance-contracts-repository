                                 LOAN AGREEMENT
     THIS LOAN AGREEMENT is made as of August 7, 2002, by and between M&I
MARSHALL & ILSLEY BANK, a Wisconsin banking corporation ("M&I"), and COBALT
CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation ("Borrower").

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, conditions and
agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is hereby agreed as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                    THE LOANS

     1.1    REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. From time to time prior to the Revolving
Credit Termination Date and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Loan Agreement, M&I agrees to make Revolving Credit Loans to Borrower. The
aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Loans outstanding at any one time shall
never exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment. Upon request of M&I, Borrower
shall confirm in writing the making of any and all Revolving Credit Loans. All
Revolving Credit Loans shall be evidenced by the Revolving Credit Note, Borrower
being obligated, however, to pay the amount of Revolving Credit Loans actually
made (including any over-advances), together with interest on the amount which
remains outstanding from time to time. Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
under this Section 1.1 subject to the terms and conditions of this Loan
Agreement. The Revolving Credit Note shall mature on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date.

     1.2    UNUSED FEE. As consideration for the Revolving Credit Commitment,
the Borrower agrees to pay to M&I on the last Business Day of each quarter prior
to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, commencing on September 30, 2002, and
on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, an unused fee equal to 0.375% per year
on the daily average unused amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment during the
preceding quarter or other applicable period.

     1.3    INTEREST. (a) Revolving Credit Loans shall be either LIBOR Loans or
Prime Rate Loans as selected by the Borrower in Section 1.5 hereof.

            (b)  In the event that any amount of the principal of, or interest
on, the Revolving Credit Note is not paid on the date when due (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), the entire principal amount
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Note shall bear interest, in addition to
the interest otherwise payable under the Revolving Credit Note and to the extent
permitted by Law, at the annual rate of two percent (2%) from the day following
the due date until all such overdue amounts have been paid in full.

            (c)  All interest, the unused fee and other amounts due under this
Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Note shall be computed for the actual
number of days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.

                                        1

     1.4    INTEREST OPTIONS.

                 (a)  PRIME RATE LOANS. The unpaid principal balance of all
            Prime Rate Loans shall bear interest at the Prime Rate. The interest
            rate for any outstanding Prime Rate Loans shall change on each day
            that the Prime Rate changes.

                 (b)  LIBOR LOANS. The unpaid principal of all LIBOR Loans shall
            bear interest at LIBOR quoted on the first Business Day of any
            calendar month (and such rate shall be the effective interest rate
            for the entire calendar month) plus the applicable Add-On. The
            interest rate for any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall change on each
            day that the applicable Add-On changes and also as of the first day
            of each calendar month. The LIBOR interest rate established on the
            first Business Day of any calendar month shall apply to all LIBOR
            Loans during that calendar month, whether previously advanced or
            advanced thereafter.

     1.5    NOTICE OF BORROWING: CONVERSION.

                 (a)  Each Revolving Credit Loan shall be made on written notice
            or telephonic notice from an authorized representative of the
            Borrower to the Person designated by M&I. Such notice shall be given
            at least one (1) Business Day prior to the day of the requested
            borrowing date (which must be a Business Day). Each notice shall
            specify the date and amount of such Revolving Credit Loan. Each new
            Revolving Credit Loan shall be a LIBOR Loan unless otherwise
            specified in writing by the Borrower to M&I at least one (1)
            Business Day in advance of the requested borrowing date. The
            Revolving Credit Loans shall be all either LIBOR Loans or Prime Rate
            Loans. Each such notice shall be effective upon receipt, provided
            that any notice received after 2:00 p.m., Milwaukee time, may be
            deemed by M&I, in its sole discretion, effective as of the next
            Business Day. Borrower shall promptly confirm any such telephonic
            request in writing.

                 (b)  Prime Rate Loans shall continue as such unless and until
            converted into LIBOR Loans or repaid. LIBOR Rate Loans shall
            continue as such unless and until they are converted into Prime Rate
            Loans or repaid.

     1.6    WARRANTY. Each notice of borrowing or conversion, and each request
for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, shall automatically constitute a
warranty by Borrower to M&I that, on the date of the requested date of such
borrowing, continuation or conversion: (a) all of the representations and
warranties of Borrower contained in this Loan Agreement shall be true and
correct on such date as though made on such date; and (b) no Default or Event of
Default shall exist on such date.

     1.7    PAYMENTS. (a) The outstanding unpaid principal balance plus all
accrued and unpaid interest on the Revolving Credit Loans shall be paid in full
on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. In the event that the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans at any time exceeds the
Revolving Credit Commitment, Borrower shall immediately pay the amount necessary
to reduce such balance to be less than or equal to the then applicable Revolving
Credit Commitment.

                                        2
<Page>

            (b)  Interest accrued on the Revolving Credit Loans through the last
day of each month (including in the case of the first interest payment, interest
accrued from the Closing Date) shall be payable on such last day of the each
month, commencing on August 31, 2002 and continuing thereafter until all
principal of and accrued interest on the Revolving Credit Loans are repaid in
full.

            (c)  All payments of principal and interest on account of the
Revolving Credit Note and all other payments made pursuant to this Loan
Agreement shall be delivered to M&I, 770 North Water Street, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin 53202, Attention: Commercial Loan Department or at such other place as
M&I or any holder of the Revolving Credit Note shall designate in writing to
Borrower, in immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., Milwaukee time on the
date when due, and if received after such time on any day shall be deemed to
have been made on the next Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made under
this Loan Agreement or under the Revolving Credit Note shall be stated to be due
on a day which is not a Business Day, the day for such payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be
included in the computation of interest. Borrower hereby authorizes M&I to debit
its deposit accounts at M&I for all payments of principal and interest due and
owing on the Revolving Credit Loans and for all other payments due and owing
under this Loan Agreement.

            (d)  All payments owed by Borrower to M&I under this Loan Agreement
and the Revolving Credit Note shall be made without any counterclaim and free
and clear of any restrictions or conditions and free and clear of, and without
deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings of any nature now or hereafter
imposed on Borrower by any governmental or other authority. If Borrower is
compelled by Law to make any such deductions or withholdings it will pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amount received by
M&I after such deductions or withholding shall equal the amount M&I would have
received had no such deductions or withholding been required to be made, and it
will provide M&I with evidence satisfactory to M&I that it has paid such
deductions or withholdings.

     1.8    USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loans to (a)
repay the outstanding principal balance, if any, of Borrower's promissory note,
dated as of December 31, 2001, in the original principal amount of $7,500,000
and payable to the order of M&I, (b) repay certain Indebtedness owing to its
Subsidiaries and (c) for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

     1.9    OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Borrower may, from time to time and without
premium or penalty, prepay the Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part.

     1.10   RECORDKEEPING. M&I shall record in its records the date and amount
of each Revolving Credit Loan and each repayment of Revolving Credit Loans. The
aggregate amounts so recorded shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the
principal and interest owing and unpaid on the Revolving Credit Note. The
failure to so record any such amount or any error in so recording any such
amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower
under this Loan Agreement or under the Revolving Credit Note to repay the
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans together with all interest
accruing thereon.

                                        3

     1.11   INCREASED COSTS. If Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, or the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation of general application, or any change therein, or any interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by M&I with any request or directive of general application (whether
or not having the force of law) or any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency:

                 (a)  shall subject M&I to any tax, duty or other charge with
            respect to the Revolving Credit Loans, the Revolving Credit Note,
            any Letter of Credit or M&I's obligation to make Revolving Credit
            Loans or issue Letters of Credit, or shall change the basis of
            taxation of payments to M&I of the principal of or interest on the
            Revolving Credit Loans or any other amounts due under this Loan
            Agreement in respect of the Revolving Credit Loans or Letters of
            Credit or M&I's obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or issue
            Letters of Credit (except for changes in the rate of tax on the
            overall net income of M&I); or

                 (b)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
            (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of
            Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any reserve
            included in the determination of interest rates pursuant to this
            Loan Agreement), special deposit or similar requirement against
            assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
            by, M&I; or

                 (c)  shall affect the amount of capital required or expected to
            be maintained by M&I or any corporation controlling M&I; or

                 (d)  shall impose on M&I any other condition affecting the
            Revolving Credit Loans, the Revolving Credit Note or the Letters of
            Credit;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to (or in the
case of Regulation D referred to above, to impose a cost on) M&I of making or
maintaining any Revolving Credit Loan or issuing Letters of Credit, or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by M&I under this Loan Agreement or
under the Revolving Credit Note with respect thereto or with respect to Letters
of Credit, then within ten (10) days after demand by M&I (which demand shall be
accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis of such demand), Borrower
shall pay directly to M&I such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
M&I for such increased cost or such reduction. Determinations by M&I for
purposes of this Section of the effect of any change in applicable laws or
regulations or of any interpretations, directives or requests thereunder on its
costs of making or maintaining Revolving Credit Loans or issuing Letters of
Credit hereunder, or sums receivable by it in respect of Revolving Credit Loans
or Letters of Credit, and of the additional amounts required to compensate M&I
in respect thereof, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

     1.12   DEPOSITS UNAVAILABLE OR INTEREST RATE UNASCERTAINABLE.

                 (a)  If M&I is advised that deposits in dollars (in the
            applicable amount) are not being offered to banks in the relevant
            market for an Interest

                                        4
<Page>

            Period, or M&I otherwise determines (which determination shall be
            binding and conclusive on all parties) that by reason of
            circumstances affecting the interbank London Eurodollar market
            adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
            applicable LIBOR; or

                 (b)  If lenders similar to M&I have determined that the LIBOR
            will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lenders of
            maintaining or funding such LIBOR Loans for an Interest Period, or
            that the making or funding of such LIBOR Loans has become
            impracticable as a result of an event occurring after the date of
            this Loan Agreement which in the opinion of M&I materially affects
            such LIBOR Loans;

then so long as such circumstances shall continue, M&I shall not be under any
obligation to make or continue LIBOR Loans and on the last day of the
then-current Interest Period, such LIBOR Loans shall, unless then repaid in
full, be converted to Prime Rate Loans.

     1.13   CHANGE IN LAW RENDERING LIBOR LOANS UNLAWFUL. In the event that any
change in (including the adoption of any new) applicable laws or regulations, or
any change in the interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any
governmental or other regulatory body charged with the administration thereof,
should make it unlawful for M&I to make, maintain or fund LIBOR Loans, then: (a)
M&I shall promptly notify Borrower; (b) the obligation of M&I to make or
continue LIBOR Loans shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be suspended
for the duration of such unlawfulness; and (c) on the last day of the current
Interest Period for LIBOR Loans (or, in any event, if M&I so requests, on such
earlier date as may be required by the relevant law, regulation or
interpretation), the LIBOR Loans shall, unless then repaid in full, be converted
to Prime Rate Loans.

     1.14   DISCRETION OF M&I AS TO MANNER OF FUNDING. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Loan Agreement to the contrary, M&I shall be entitled to fund
and maintain its funding of all or any part of the Revolving Credit Loans in any
manner it sees fit, provided that no such funding decision on the part of M&I
shall affect any interest option election made by Borrower as to any Revolving
Credit Loan.

     1.15   LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) From time to time prior to the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, Borrower may request, and M&I may issue, Letters of
Credit up to an aggregate undrawn face amount of $30,000,000. The aggregate
undrawn face amount of all Letters of Credit shall reduce the amount available
for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Commitment. In the event the Borrower
does not reimburse M&I in full on the date M&I is required to make a payment

received in the ordinary course of business) that any other party to an in-force
Existing Reinsurance Agreement will cancel or not renew such agreement, which
cancellation or nonrenewal could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business or condition (financial or otherwise) of the

Letters of Credit are canceled or terminated and all obligations to M&I are paid
