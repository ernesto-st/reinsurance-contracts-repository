                                  THE CREDITS
                                  -----------

     2.1  Commitment.  From and including the date of this Agreement and prior
          ----------
to the Facility Termination Date, each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to (i) make Loans to the Borrower from
time to time and (ii) participate in Facility LCs issued upon the request of any
Credit Party from time to time, provided that, after giving effect to the making
of each such Loan and the issuance of each such Facility LC, such Lender's
Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed in the aggregate at any one time
outstanding the amount of its Commitment.  Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time prior to the
Facility Termination Date.  The Commitments to extend credit hereunder shall
expire on the Facility Termination Date.  The LC Issuer will issue Facility LCs
hereunder on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.19.

     2.2  Required Payments; Termination.  The Aggregate Outstanding Credit
          ------------------------------
Exposure and all other unpaid Obligations shall be paid in full by the
applicable Credit Party on the Facility Termination Date.

     2.3  Ratable Loans.  Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans made
          -------------
from the several Lenders ratably according to their Pro Rata Shares.

     2.4  Types of Advances.  The Advances may be Floating Rate Advances or

          -----------------------------------------------------------------
The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender according
to its Pro Rata Share a facility fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable
Facility Fee Rate on such Lender's Commitment from the date hereof to and
including the Facility Termination Date, payable on each Payment Date hereafter
and on the Facility Termination Date.  The Borrower

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

also agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender according to its
Pro Rata Share a utilization fee for each day from the date hereof to and
including the later of the Facility Termination Date and the date all Credit
Extensions are paid in full and all Commitments are terminated, such utilization
fee to be equal to the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate for such day multiplied
by the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure on such day, payable on each
Payment Date and on the Facility Termination Date. The Borrower may permanently
reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among the Lenders
in integral multiples of $10,000,000, upon at least three (3) Business Days'
written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such
reduction, provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may
not be reduced below the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure. All accrued
facility and utilization fees shall be payable on the effective date of any
termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Credit Extensions
hereunder.

     2.6  Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Advance shall be in the minimum
          ------------------------------
amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof);
provided, however, that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount of the
Available Aggregate Commitment.

     2.7  Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may from time to time pay,
          ---------------------------
without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a
minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon one
(1) Business Day's prior notice to the Agent.  The Borrower may from time to
time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4 but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurodollar
Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding
Eurodollar Advances upon three (3) Business Days' prior notice to the Agent.

     2.8  Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.  The
          ---------------------------------------------------------------
Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurodollar
Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time.  The Borrower
shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") not later than
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one (1) Business Day before the Borrowing
Date of each Floating Rate Advance and three (3) Business Days before the
Borrowing Date for each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

          (i)    the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
     Advance,

          (ii)   the aggregate amount of such Advance,

          (iii)  the Type of Advance selected, and

          (iv)   in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period
     applicable thereto.

     Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender
shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available in Chicago
to the Agent at its address

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

specified pursuant to Article XIV. The Agent will make the funds so received
from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

     2.9  Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances.  Floating Rate
          ---------------------------------------------------
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating
Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section
2.9 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.7.  Each Eurodollar Advance shall
continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest
Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically
converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such Eurodollar Advance is or
was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given
the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that,
at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance continue as a
Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period.  Subject to the
terms of Section 2.6, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or
any part of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance.  The Borrower
shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of
each conversion of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance or
continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or
continuation, specifying:

          (i)   the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
     conversion or continuation,

          (ii)  the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
     converted or continued, and

          (iii) the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into or
     continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest Period
     applicable thereto.

     2.10 Changes in Interest Rate, etc.  Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear
          ------------------------------
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a
Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but
excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant
to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such
day.  Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained
as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in
the Alternate Base Rate.  Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate determined by the Agent as applicable to
such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8
and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.  No Interest Period
may end after the Facility Termination Date.  The Borrower shall select Interest
Periods so that it is not necessary to repay any portion of a Eurodollar Advance
prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period in order to make a
mandatory repayment required pursuant to Section 2.2.

                                      -16-

     2.11 Rates Applicable After Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the
          ------------------------------
contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a Default or
Unmatured Default no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a
Eurodollar Advance.  During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders
may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at
the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder
of the applicable Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate otherwise applicable to
such Interest Period plus 2% per annum, (ii) each Floating Rate Advance shall
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time
to time plus 2% per annum and (iii) the LC Fee shall be increased by 2% per
annum, provided that, during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or
7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above and the increase
in the LC Fee set forth in clause (iii) above shall be applicable to all Credit
Extensions without any election or action on the part of the Agent or any
Lender.

     2.12 Method of Payment.  All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be
          ------------------
made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds
to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XIV, or at any
other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the
Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall (except in the
case of Reimbursement Obligations for which the LC Issuer has not been fully
indemnified by the Lenders, or as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be
applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment delivered to the
Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to
such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIV or at any Lending Installation specified in a
notice received by the Agent from such Lender.  The Agent is hereby authorized
to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with Bank One for each payment
of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and fees as it becomes due
hereunder.  Each reference to the Agent in this Section 2.12 shall also be
deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, to the LC Issuer, in the case of
payments required to be made by the Borrower to the LC Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.19.6.

     2.13 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.  (i)  Each Lender shall
          --------------------------------------------
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by
such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (ii) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record
     (a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
     Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or
     interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to
     each Lender hereunder, (c) the original stated amount of each Facility LC
     and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, and (d) the
     amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the Borrower and
     each Lender's share thereof.

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

          (iii)  The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
     paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
     existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided,
     however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such
     accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
     of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.

          (iv)   Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a
     promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit A (including any
     amendment, modification, renewal or replacement thereof, a "Note").  In
     such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender
     such Note payable to the order of such Lender.  Thereafter, the Loans
     evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
     after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or
     more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee
     pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or
     assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests
     that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and
     (ii) above.  Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of any Lender as to
     the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Lender's Note, and, in
     the case of any such loss, theft destruction or mutilation, upon
     cancellation of such Note, the Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a
     replacement Note in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like
     tenor.

     2.14 Telephonic Notices.  The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and
          ------------------
the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of
Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or
persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of
the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is
specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation
Notices to be given telephonically.  The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent
or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer.  If
the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken
by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall
govern absent manifest error.

     2.15 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest accrued on
          ----------------------------------------------
each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which
the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise,
and at maturity.  Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal
amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day
other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion.  Interest
accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its
applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is
prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest
accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three
months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during
such Interest Period.  Interest, facility fees, utilization fees and LC Fees
shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.
Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of
any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

(local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest
on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment.

     2.16 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender
----------
of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
Promptly after notice from the LC Issuer, the Agent will notify each Lender of
the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC hereunder.  The Agent
will notify each Lender of the Eurodollar Rate applicable to each Eurodollar
Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each
Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.

     2.17 Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans and its
          ---------------------
participation in any LC Obligations and the LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs
at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the
case may be, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time.  All
terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the
Loans, Facility LCs, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued
hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may
be, for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender and the LC
Issuer may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with
Article XIV, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through
which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and for
whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to be
made.

     2.18 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent.  Unless any Credit Party or a
          ---------------------------------
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of any Credit Party, a payment of
principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it
does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has
been made.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of
such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption.  If such Lender or any Credit Party, as the case may be, has not in
fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together
with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the
date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent
recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by
a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days
and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the
case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant
Loan.

                   --------
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue standby letters of credit (each

each Facility LC ("Modify," and each such action a "Modification"), from time to
time from and including the date of this Agreement and prior to the Facility
Termination Date upon the request of and for the account of any Credit Party;
provided that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified, (i)
the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations shall not exceed
$200,000,000, (ii) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed
the Aggregate Commitment, (iii) the initial face amount of any Facility LC shall
not be less than $5,000,000 and (iv) there shall be no more than eight (8)
Facility LCs outstanding at any one time.  No Facility LC shall have an expiry
date later than the earlier of (x) the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility
Termination Date and (y) one year after its issuance.

          2.19.2.  Participations.  Upon the issuance or Modification by the LC
                   --------------
Issuer of a Facility LC in accordance with this Section 2.19, the LC Issuer
shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have
unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be
deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and
irrevocably purchased from the LC Issuer, a participation in such Facility LC
(and each Modification thereof) and the related LC Obligations in proportion to
its Pro Rata Share.

          2.19.3.  Notice.  Subject to Section 2.19.1, a requesting Credit Party
                   ------
shall give the LC Issuer notice prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance or Modification of each
Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or
Modification) and the expiry date of such Facility LC, and describing the
proposed terms of such Facility LC and the nature of the transactions proposed
to be supported thereby.  Upon receipt of such notice, the LC Issuer shall
promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender, of
the contents thereof and of the amount of such Lender's participation in such
proposed Facility LC.  The issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of any
Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article
IV (the satisfaction of which the LC Issuer shall have no duty to ascertain), be
subject to the conditions precedent that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory
to the LC Issuer and that a Credit Party shall have executed and delivered such
application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to
such Facility LC as the LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a
"Facility LC Application").  In the event of any conflict between the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this
Agreement shall control.

          2.19.4.  LC Fees.  The requesting Credit Party shall pay to the Agent,
                   -------
for the account of the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares, with respect to each standby Facility LC, a letter of credit fee at
a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility LC Rate in effect from time to
time on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such standby Facility LC,
such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date (such fee described in
this sentence an "LC Fee").  The requesting Credit Party shall also pay to the
LC

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

Issuer for its own account (x) at the time of issuance of each Facility LC, a
fronting fee in an amount to be agreed upon between the LC Issuer and the Credit
Parties, and (y) documentary and processing charges in connection with the
issuance or Modification of and draws under Facility LCs in accordance with the
LC Issuer's standard schedule for such charges as in effect from time to time.

          2.19.5.  Administration; Reimbursement by Lenders.  Upon receipt from
                   ----------------------------------------
the beneficiary of any Facility LC of any demand for payment under such Facility
LC, the LC Issuer shall notify the Agent and the Agent shall promptly notify
each Credit Party and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid by the LC
Issuer as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the "LC Payment
Date").  The responsibility of the LC Issuer to the Credit Parties and each
Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for
payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment
shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC.  The LC
Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and
administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit
in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence
of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the LC Issuer, each Lender
shall be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence
of any Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the LC Issuer
on demand for (i) such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment
made by the LC Issuer under each Facility LC to the extent such amount is not
reimbursed by the applicable Credit Party pursuant to Section 2.19.6 below, plus
(ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such Lender, for each
day from the date of the LC Issuer's demand for such reimbursement (or, if such
demand is made after 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such date, from the next
succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be
reimbursed by it, at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Effective Rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest
equal to the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances.

          2.19.6.  Reimbursement by the applicable Credit Party.  The applicable
                   --------------------------------------------
Credit Party shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the
LC Issuer on or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid
by the LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without presentment,
demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided that neither the
applicable Credit Party nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from asserting
any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by such Credit
Party or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether a
request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of
such Facility LC or (ii) the LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC
issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with
the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.  All such amounts paid by the LC
Issuer and remaining unpaid by the applicable Credit Party shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the
rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls on or
before the applicable LC Payment Date and (y) the sum of 2% plus the rate
applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls after such
LC Payment Date.  The LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably in accordance
with its Pro Rata

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

Share all amounts received by it from the applicable Credit Party for
application in payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in
respect of any Facility LC issued by the LC Issuer, but only to the extent such
Lender has made payment to the LC Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant
to Section 2.19.5. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including without limitation the submission of a Borrowing Notice in compliance
with Section 2.8 and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set
forth in Article IV), the Borrower may request an Advance hereunder for the
purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.

          2.19.7.  Obligations Absolute.   Each Credit Party's obligations
                   --------------------
under this Section 2.19 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which any Credit Party may have or have had against the LC Issuer, any Lender or
any beneficiary of a Facility LC.  Each Credit Party further agrees with the LC
Issuer and the Lenders that the LC Issuer and the Lenders shall not be
responsible for, and any Credit Party's Reimbursement Obligation in respect of
any Facility LC shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or
genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged,
or any dispute between or among any Credit Party, any of its Affiliates, the
beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to
whom any Facility LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of
any Credit Party or of any of its Affiliates against the beneficiary of any
Facility LC or any such transferee.  The LC Issuer shall not be liable for any
error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of
any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC.
Each Credit Party agrees that any action taken or omitted by the LC Issuer or
any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and the related drafts
and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be
binding upon each Credit Party and shall not put the LC Issuer or any Lender
under any liability to any Credit Party.  Nothing in this Section 2.19.7 is
intended to limit the right of any Credit Party to make a claim against the LC
Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 2.19.6.

          2.19.8.  Actions of LC Issuer.  The LC Issuer shall be entitled to
                   --------------------
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Facility LC, draft,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other
document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal
counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the LC Issuer.
The LC Issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it
shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against
any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 2.19, the LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in
accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future
holders of a participation in any Facility LC.

          2.19.9.  Indemnification.  Each Credit Party hereby agrees to
                   ---------------
indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, the LC Issuer and the Agent, and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and
all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such
Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against
such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of
or in connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or
payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of
any Facility LC, including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses which the LC Issuer may incur by reason of or in
connection with (i) the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with
its obligations to the LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall
affect any rights any Credit Party may have against any defaulting Lender) or
(ii) by reason of or on account of the LC Issuer issuing any Facility LC which
specifies that the term "Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by
operation of law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not
require that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a
copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the LC Issuer, evidencing the
appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that the Credit Parties
shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent for
any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but
only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC
complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (y) the LC Issuer's failure to
pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. Nothing in this
Section 2.19.9 is intended to limit the obligations of any Credit Party under
any other provision of this Agreement.

          2.19.10.  Lenders' Indemnification.  Each Lender shall, ratably in
                    ------------------------
accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify the LC Issuer, its affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Credit Parties) against any cost, expense (including
reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or
liability (except such as result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or
willful misconduct or the LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after
the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of the Facility LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in
connection with this Section 2.19 or any action taken or omitted by such
indemnitees hereunder.

          2.19.11.  Facility LC Collateral Account.  Each Credit Party agrees
                    ------------------------------
that it will, upon the request of the Agent or the Required Lenders and until
the final expiration date of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any
amount is payable to the LC Issuer or the Lenders in respect of any Facility LC,
maintain a special collateral account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to
the Agent (the "Facility LC Collateral Account") at the Agent's office at the
address specified pursuant to Article XIV, in the name of such Credit Party but
under the sole dominion and control of the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders
and in which

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

such Credit Party shall have no interest other than as set forth in Section 8.1.
Each Credit Party hereby pledges, assigns and grants to the Agent, on behalf of
and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the LC Issuer, a security
interest in all of such Credit Party's right, title and interest in and to all
funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral
Account to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the
Obligations. The Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the
Facility LC Collateral Account in certificates of deposit of Bank One having a
maturity not exceeding thirty (30) days. Nothing in this Section 2.19.11 shall
either obligate the Agent to require any Credit Party to deposit any funds in
the Facility LC Collateral Account or limit the right of the Agent to release
any funds held in the Facility LC Collateral Account in each case other than as
required by Section 8.1.

          2.19.12.  Rights as a Lender.  In its capacity as a Lender, the LC
                    ------------------
Issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any other Lender.

          2.19.13   Existing Letters of Credit.  Upon the satisfaction of each
                    --------------------------
of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1, (a) each Existing Letter
of Credit shall be deemed to be a Facility LC issued hereunder and (b) the LC
Issuer shall be deemed to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each
Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed to have unconditionally and irrevocably
purchased from the LC Issuer, a participation in such Facility LC and the
related LC Obligations in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.

     2.20 Replacement of Lender.  If the Borrower is required pursuant to
          ---------------------
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances
into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender
so affected an "Affected Lender"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts
continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such
Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or
Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i)
another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances
and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes
under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be
terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3
applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected
Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees
and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the
Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without
limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5,
and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to
such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of
such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the
replacement Lender.

                            -----------------------

     3.1  Yield Protection.  If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
          ----------------
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency:

          (i)    subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or
     the LC Issuer to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments
     (other than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender or the LC Issuer
     in respect of its Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or participations therein,
     or

          (ii)   imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
     assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
     against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
     by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer
     (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the
     interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

          (iii)  imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
     the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC
     Issuer of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans, or of
     issuing or participating in Facility LCs, or reduces any amount receivable
     by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer in
     connection with its Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or participations
     therein, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or
     the LC Issuer to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of
     Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or participations therein held or interest
     or LC Fees received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender or
     the LC Issuer, as the case may be,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, of making
or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or Commitment or of issuing or participating
in Facility LCs or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable
Lending Installation or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, in connection with
such Eurodollar Loans, Commitment, Facility LCs or participations therein, then,
within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case
may be, the Credit Parties shall pay such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case
may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the
LC Issuer, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduction in amount
received.

     3.2  Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.  If a Lender or the LC Issuer
          ---------------------------------------
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or the LC Issuer, any Lending Installation of such Lender or the LC
Issuer or any corporation controlling

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

such Lender or the LC Issuer is increased as a result of a Change, then, within
fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender or the LC Issuer, the Credit Parties
shall pay such Lender or the LC Issuer the amount necessary to compensate for
any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital
which such Lender or the LC Issuer determines is attributable to this Agreement,
its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make Loans and issue or
participate in Facility LCs, as the case may be, hereunder (after taking into
account such Lender's or the LC Issuer's policies as to capital adequacy).
"Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based
Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law,
governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by any Lender or the LC Issuer or any Lending Installation or
any corporation controlling any Lender or the LC Issuer. "Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United
States on the date of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (ii) the
corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside
the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on
Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence
of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and
any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3  Availability of Types of Advances.  If any Lender determines that
          ---------------------------------
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then
the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any
affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

     3.4  Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
          -----------------------
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar
Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other
than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any
loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation,
any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or
maintain such Eurodollar Advance.

     3.5  Taxes.  3.5.1  (i) All payments by any Credit Party to or for the
          -----
account of any Lender, or the LC Issuer or the Agent hereunder or under any Note
or Facility LC Application shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
for any and all Taxes.  If any Credit Party shall be required by law to deduct
any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, or the
LC Issuer or the Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender, or the LC Issuer or
the Agent (as the case may be)

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (b) such Credit Party shall make such deductions, (c) such
Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in
accordance with applicable law and (d) such Credit Party shall furnish to the
Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within thirty
(30) days after such payment is made.

          (ii)   In addition, each Credit Party hereby agrees to pay any present
     or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
     taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
     hereunder or under any Note or Facility LC Application or from the
     execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or
     any Note or Facility LC Application ("Other Taxes").

          (iii)  Each Credit Party hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent, or the
     LC Issuer and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
     (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts
     payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Agent, or the LC Issuer or such
     Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses)
     arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  Payments due under this
     indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date the
     Agent, or the LC Issuer or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to
     Section 3.6.

          (iv)   Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
     United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender")
     agrees that it will, not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of
     this Agreement, (i) deliver to each of the Credit Parties and the Agent two
     duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
     or W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to
     receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of
     any United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of the
     Credit Parties and the Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or
     W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption
     from United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further
     undertakes to deliver to each of the Credit Parties and the Agent (x)
     renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or
     before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after
     the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so
     delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be
     reasonably requested by any Credit Party or the Agent. All forms or
     amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such
     Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
     deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless
     an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or
     regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
     otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
     would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
     or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Credit Parties
     and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
     deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

          (v)   For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
     provide the Credit Parties with an appropriate form pursuant to clause
     (iv), above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
     regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof
     by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a
     form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall
     not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to
     Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender
     which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding
     tax become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
     required under clause (iv), above, each Credit Party shall take such steps
     as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S.
     Lender to recover such Taxes.

          (vi)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
     withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note
     pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall
     deliver to the Credit Parties (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or
     times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
     documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to
     be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

          (vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
     authority of the United States or any other country or any political
     subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
     withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because
     the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such
     Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which
     rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other
     reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid,
     directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or
     otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by
     any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent under this subsection,
     together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto (including
     reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable time charges of attorneys for the
     Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent).  The obligations of
     the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the
     Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     3.6  Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent reasonably
          ----------------------------------------
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Credit Parties (with a copy to
the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5.
Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations
upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on each Credit Party in the absence of manifest error.  Determination of
amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall
be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the
purchase of a

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a
reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in
fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount
specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand
after receipt by the Credit Parties of such written statement. The obligations
of each Credit Party under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment
of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     5.2  Authorization and Validity.  Each Credit Party has the corporate power
          --------------------------
and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to
perform its obligations thereunder.  The execution and delivery by each Credit
Party of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder
have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan
Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each Credit Party
enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     5.3  No Conflict; Government Consent.  Neither the execution and delivery
          -------------------------------
by any Credit Party of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Credit Party's or any of its Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation or by-laws
or the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which any Credit
Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or
its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of
any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, instrument or agreement, other than such violations, conflicts or
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  No order, consent, approval,
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority, or any

financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the September 30,
2001 unaudited  consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the Lenders (the "Financial Statements")
were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present the
consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries at such dates and the consolidated results of their operations for
the periods then ended.

reserves have been provided. The United States income tax returns of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service
through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995. No tax liens have been filed
and no claims against the Borrower or its Subsidiaries are being asserted with

provided with respect thereto on the books of such Credit Party and its
Subsidiaries). As of the date hereof, the Borrower has no material Contingent
Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the Financial Statements. Solely
for purposes of any reaffirmation of the foregoing representations pursuant to
Section 4.2(ii) in connection with any Loans (but not in connection with any
issuance of a Facility LC) the proceeds of which are used to repay maturing
commercial paper Indebtedness, such representations shall not extend to any
proceeding in which a punitive damages judgment has been entered against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, such judgment has been stayed on appeal or the time
for appeal from such judgment has not expired and such judgment could not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Borrower to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents.

which occurrence or withdrawal could result in a Material Adverse Effect. No
steps have been taken to terminate any Plan which has Unfunded Liabilities.

restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Credit Party nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions
contained in any agreement to which it is a party, which default could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Credit Party nor
any Significant Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any
agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

have complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective Property, except where the
failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Credit Party nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect
that its operations are not in material compliance with any of the requirements
of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and safety statutes
and regulations or the subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating
whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a release of any toxic or

     8.1  Acceleration; Facility LC Collateral Account. (i) If any Default
          --------------------------------------------
     described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with respect to any Credit Party,
     the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and the obligation
     and power of the LC Issuer to issue Facility LCs shall automatically
     terminate and the Obligations shall immediately become due and payable
     without any election or action on the part of the Agent, the LC Issuer or
     any Lender and the Credit Parties will be and become thereby
     unconditionally obligated, without any further notice, act or demand, to
     pay to the Agent an amount in immediately available funds, which funds
     shall be held in the Facility LC Collateral Account, equal to the
     difference of (x) the amount of LC Obligations at such time, less (y) the
     amount on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account at such time which
     is free and clear of all rights and claims of third parties and has not
     been applied against the Obligations (such difference, the "Collateral
     Shortfall Amount"). If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or
     the Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may (a) terminate or
     suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and the
     obligation and power of the LC Issuer to issue Facility LCs, or declare the
     Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall
     become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
     notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives, and
     (b) upon notice to the Credit Parties and in addition to the continuing
     right to demand payment of all amounts payable under this Agreement, make
     demand on the Credit Parties to pay, and the Credit Parties will, forthwith
     upon such demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the Agent
     the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the
     Facility LC Collateral Account.

          (ii)  If at any time while any Default is continuing, the Agent
     determines that the Collateral Shortfall Amount at such time is greater
     than zero, the Agent may make demand on the Credit Parties to pay, and the
     Credit Parties will, forthwith upon such demand and without any further
     notice or act, pay to the Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which
     funds shall be deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account.

          (iii) The Agent may at any time or from time to time after funds are
     deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account, apply such funds to the
     payment of the Obligations and any other amounts as shall from time to time
     have become due and payable by the Credit Parties to the Lenders or the LC
     Issuer under the Loan Documents.

          (iv)  At any time while any Default is continuing, neither any Credit
     Party nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through any Credit Party
     shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Facility LC
     Collateral Account. After all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly
     paid in full and the Aggregate Commitment has been terminated, any funds
     remaining in the Facility LC Collateral Account shall be returned by the
     Agent to applicable Credit Party or paid to whomever may be legally
     entitled thereto at such time.

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

          (v)   If, before any judgment or decree for the payment of the
     Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Modified Required
     Lenders (or, in the case of an automatic termination upon the occurrence of
     a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, all the Lenders), in their sole
     discretion, shall so direct, the Agent shall, by notice to the Credit
     Parties, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.

     8.2  Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
          ----------
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Credit Parties may enter into agreements supplemental hereto
for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or
changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or any Credit Party hereunder
or thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder or thereunder; provided, however,
that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender:

          (i)   Extend the Facility Termination Date or extend the expiry date
     of any Facility LC to a date after the Facility Termination Date,
     compromise or forgive the principal amount of any Credit Extension or any
     Reimbursement Obligation related thereto, or reduce the rate of interest or
     compromise or forgive payment of interest on any Credit Extension or any
     Reimbursement Obligation related thereto, or reduce the amount of any fee
     payable hereunder.

          (ii)  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
     Lenders or Modified Required Lenders.

          (iii) Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder
     or the commitment to issue Facility LCs, or permit any Credit Party to
     assign its rights under this Agreement.

          (iv)  Amend this Section 8.2.

     No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall
be effective without the written consent of the Agent and no amendment of any
provision relating to the LC Issuer shall be effective without the written
consent of the LC Issuer. The Agent may waive payment of the fee required under
Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent of any other party to this
Agreement.

     8.3  Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders, the LC
          ----------------------
Issuer or the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of a
Default or the inability of any Credit Party to satisfy the conditions precedent
to such Credit Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any
single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or
other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents
whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required
pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing
specifically set forth.  All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agent, the LC
Issuer and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

     9.5  Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
          -----------------------------------------------
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of
its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any
right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties
hereto expressly agree that the Arrangers shall enjoy the benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth

attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, the LC Issuer, the
Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent, the LC

<PAGE>

Agent, the LC Issuer, any Arranger or any Lender in connection with the
collection of the Obligations or the enforcement of the Loan Documents. Each

litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Agent, the LC Issuer, any
Arranger or any Lender is a party thereto, but excluding those indemnified
obligations arising solely from any Lender's failure to perform its obligations
under this Agreement) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder, except that no
indemnified party shall be indemnified for any indemnified obligations arising
from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction. The obligations of each Credit Party under this
Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient counterparts
so that the Agent may furnish one to the LC Issuer and each of the Lenders.

          ----------
terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations
hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.

     9.9  Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that
          --------------------------
is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation,
enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

     9.10 Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the Credit Parties
          -----------------------
on the one hand and the Lenders, the LC Issuer and the Agent on the other hand

sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by such Credit
Party in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the
transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan
Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith,
unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought.  Neither the
Agent, any Arranger, the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall have any liability with

Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents.  The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
X.  Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting
as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to
those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each
of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency
theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of
which claims each Lender hereby waives.

          ------
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The

<PAGE>

Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except
any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

          ----------------
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any Credit Party, the Lenders
or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or
therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

     10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor any
          -------------------------------------------
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have
any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each

or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity,

the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by any Credit Party
to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by any Credit Party to
the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

     10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
          ---------------------------------
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

     10.8   Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to
            -----------------------------------------
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by any Credit Party for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement
by any Credit Party under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses
incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent
in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two
or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing
to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required
pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions
thereof.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     10.9   Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
            -----------------
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or any
Credit Party referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders.

     10.10  Rights as a Lender.  In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
            ------------------
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity.  The Agent
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage
in any kind of trust,

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, with any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries in which such Credit Party or such Subsidiary is not restricted
hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its individual
capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

     10.11  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
            ----------------------
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arrangers or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by any Credit Party and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, the Arrangers or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     10.12  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving written
            ---------------
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Credit Parties, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of each Credit Party and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days
after the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of each Credit Party and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any
time without the consent of any Credit Party or any Lender, appoint any of its
Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed,
the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and each Credit
Party shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable
Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No
successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor
Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be a
commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the
Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean
the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

     10.14  Delegation to Affiliates.  Each Credit Party and the Lenders agree
            ------------------------
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates.  Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers,
agents and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement
shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

     10.15  Documentation Agents, Syndication Agent, etc.  None of the Lenders
            ---------------------------------------------
identified in this Agreement as the "Documentation Agents" or the "Syndication
Agent" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or
duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to
have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the
same acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to
the Agent in Section 10.11.

                           ------------------------

     11.1 Setoff.  In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
          -------
Lenders under applicable law, if any Credit Party becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of any Credit Party
may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

     11.2 Ratable Payments.  If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
          ----------------
payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than payments
received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than
that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure held by the
other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata
Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure.  If any Lender, whether in
connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise,
receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts
which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such
collateral ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares of the
Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure.  In case any such payment is disturbed by
legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.

               BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
               -------------------------------------------------

     12.1 Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan
          ----------------------
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Credit Party
and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) no
Credit Party shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii)
of this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any
pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a
Lender which is a fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its
obligations to its trustee; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment
creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its
obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with
the provisions of Section 12.3.  The Agent may treat the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless
and until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the
Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions
from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments
relating to such Loan or Note to another Person.  Any assignee of the rights to
any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all
the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or
consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a
Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on
any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

     12.2 Participations.
          --------------

          12.2.1  Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Lender may, in the
                  ------------------------------
     ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
     any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
     participating interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender,
     any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other
     interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the event of any such
     sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
     obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender
     shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
     performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its
     Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in
     evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts
     payable by any Credit Party under this Agreement shall be determined as if
     such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and each Credit
     Party and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
     Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the
     Loan Documents.

          12.2.2  Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
                  -------------
     approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than
     any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Credit Extension
     or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require
     consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of
     any other Loan Document.

          12.2.3  Benefit of Setoff.  Each Credit Party agrees that each
                  -----------------
     Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section
     11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the
     Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating
     interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents,
     provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in
     Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to
     each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and
     each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section
     11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the
     exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance
     with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

     12.3 Assignments.
          -----------

          12.3.1  Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may, in the ordinary course
                  ---------------------
     of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
     to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of
     its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Such assignment shall
     be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form as may be
     agreed to by the parties thereto.  The consent of each Credit Party, the
     Agent and the LC Issuer shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
     effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate
     thereof; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is
     continuing, the consent of any Credit Party shall not be required.  Such
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Each such
     assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an
     Affiliate thereof shall (unless each of the Credit Parties and the Agent
     otherwise consents) be in an amount not less than the lesser of (i)
     $5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
     Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment) or outstanding
     Loans (if the applicable Commitment has been terminated).

          12.3.2  Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an
                  ----------------------
     assignment, together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii)
     payment of a $4,000 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment, such
     assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such
     assignment.  The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser
     to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of
     the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable
     assignment agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and
     that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan
     Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.  On and after the
     effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be
     a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

     executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and
     obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if
     it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by any
     Credit Party, the Lenders or the Agent shall be required to release the
     transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate
     Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser. Upon
     the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
     12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the
     transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by
     Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate,
     replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as
     appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case
     in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted
     pursuant to such assignment.

     12.4 Dissemination of Information.  Each Credit Party authorizes each
          ----------------------------
Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring
an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and
any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of any Credit Party and its Subsidiaries,
including without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section
9.11 of this Agreement.

     12.5 Tax Treatment.  If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to
          -------------
any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

                                   GUARANTY
                                   --------


     13.1 Guaranty of Payment.  The Borrower hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
          -------------------
unconditionally guarantees prompt, full and complete payment when due, whether
at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter,
of all Obligations (the "Guaranteed Debt").  The Borrower agrees that if TMK Re
                         ---------------
shall fail to pay when due any Guaranteed Debt, the Borrower will promptly pay
the same without notice or demand whatsoever.  This is a guaranty of payment,
not a guaranty of collection.

     13.2 Acceptance of Guaranty; No Setoffs.  The Borrower waives notice of the
          ----------------------------------
acceptance of this Guaranty and of the extension or incurrence of the Guaranteed
Debt or any part thereof.  The Borrower further waives all setoffs and
counterclaims and presentment, protest, notice, filing of claims with a court in
the event of receivership, bankruptcy or reorganization of TMK Re, demand or
action on delinquency in respect of the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof,
including any right to require the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders to sue
TMK Re, any other guarantor or any other Person obligated with respect to the
Guaranteed Debt

                                      -53-

or any part thereof, or otherwise to enforce payment thereof against any
collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof.

     13.3 Nature of Guaranty; Continuing, Absolute and Unconditional.  The
          ----------------------------------------------------------
Borrower hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, its
obligations hereunder shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional under any
and all circumstances and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment,
termination, defense (other than indefeasible payment in full), setoff,
counterclaim or recoupment whatsoever (all of which are hereby expressly waived
by it to the fullest extent permitted by law), whether by reason of any claim of
any character whatsoever, including, without limitation, any claim of waiver,
release, surrender, alteration or compromise.  The validity and enforceability
of this Guaranty shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a)
any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or
substitution for, the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or any agreement
relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to perfect or maintain
any lien on, or preserve rights to, any security or collateral or to enforce any
right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof
or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Guaranteed
Debt or any part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any
default with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or any agreement
relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt
or any part thereof; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver,
subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any collateral
securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof, any other guaranties with
respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof, or any other obligations of
any person or entity with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof;
(e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or
the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or
with respect to any collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof;
(f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of
indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Debt, any part thereof or amounts which
are not covered by this Guaranty even though the LC Issuer and the Lenders might
lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the
Guaranteed Debt or to amounts which are not covered by this Guaranty; (g) any
change of ownership of TMK Re or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change
in the legal status of TMK Re; (h) any change in, or the imposition of, any law,
decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay
or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the
Guaranteed Debt; (i) the failure of TMK Re to maintain in full force, validity
or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental, insurance and
other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed
Debt or this Guaranty, or to take any other action required in connection with
the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed Debt or this
Guaranty; (j) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which the
Borrower may have at any time against TMK Re or any other guarantor or any other
Person in connection herewith or with any unrelated transaction; (k) the LC
Issuer and the Lenders' election, in any case or proceeding instituted under
chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any applicable federal, state
or foreign bankruptcy or other similar law, of the application of Section
1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code or other similar provision under
any applicable federal, state or foreign bankruptcy or other similar law; (l)
any borrowing, use of cash collateral, or grant of a security interest by TMK
Re, as debtor in possession, under Section 363 or 364 of

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

the United States Bankruptcy Code or any applicable federal, state or foreign
bankruptcy or other similar law; (m) the disallowance of all or any portion of
any of the LC Issuer and the Lenders' claims for repayment of the Guaranteed
Debt under Section 502 or 506 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any
applicable federal, state or foreign bankruptcy or other similar law; or (n) any
other fact or circumstance which might otherwise constitute grounds at law or
equity for the discharge or release of the Borrower from its obligations
hereunder, all whether or not the Borrower shall have had notice or knowledge of
any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (n) of this
paragraph. It is agreed that the Borrower's liability hereunder is independent
of any other guaranties or other obligations at any time in effect with respect
to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof, and that the Borrower's liability
hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or
non-enforcement of any such other guaranties or other obligations or any
provision of any applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by
TMK Re of the Guaranteed Debt in the manner agreed upon among the Agent, the LC
Issuer, the Lenders and TMK Re.

     13.4 Dealings with TMK Re.  Credit may be granted or continued from time to
          --------------------
time by the LC Issuer or the Lenders to TMK Re without notice to or
authorization from the Borrower regardless of TMK Re's financial or other
condition at the time of any such grant or continuation.  Neither the Agent, the
LC Issuer nor any Participant shall have an obligation to disclose or discuss
with the Borrower its assessment of the financial condition of TMK Re.

     13.5 Subrogation.  Until the irrevocable payment in full of the Obligations
          -----------
and termination of all commitments which could give rise to any Obligation, the
Borrower shall have no right of subrogation with respect to the Guaranteed Debt
and hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which the Agent, the LC Issuer
or the Lenders now have or may hereafter have against TMK Re, any endorser or
any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Debt, and the Borrower
hereby waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or
collateral given to the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders to secure payment of
the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or any other liability of TMK Re to the
Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders.  Upon such irrevocable payment and
termination, TMK Re shall indemnify the Borrower for the full amount of any
payment made by the Borrower under this Guaranty and the Borrower shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made
to the extent of such payment.

     13.6 Collateral.  The Borrower authorizes the Agent, the LC Issuer and the
          ----------
Lenders to take any action or exercise any remedy with respect to any non-cash
collateral from time to time securing the Guaranteed Debt, which the Agent, the
LC Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion shall determine, without
notice to the Borrower.  In the event the Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders
in their sole discretion elect to give notice of any action with respect to any
non-cash collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof, ten (10)
days' written notice mailed to the Borrower by ordinary mail at the address set
forth on the signature pages hereto shall be deemed reasonable notice of any
matters contained in such notice.  The Borrower consents and agrees that neither
the Agent, the LC Issuer nor the Lenders shall be under any obligation to
marshall any assets in favor of the Borrower or against or in payment of any or
all of the Guaranteed Debt.

     13.7 Rights to Payments, Etc.  In the event that acceleration of the time
          -----------------------
for payment of any of the Guaranteed Debt is stayed upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of TMK Re, or otherwise, all such amounts shall
nonetheless be payable by the Borrower forthwith upon demand by the Agent, the
LC Issuer or the Lenders.  The Borrower further agrees that, to the extent that
TMK Re makes a payment or payments to any of the LC Issuer or the Lenders on the
Guaranteed Debt, or the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders receive any proceeds
of collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt, which payment or receipt of proceeds
or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be returned or repaid to TMK Re, its
estate, trustee, receiver, debtor in possession or any other party, including,
without limitation, the Borrower, under any insolvency or bankruptcy law, state
or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
payment, return or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which has been
paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in
full force and effect as of the date when such initial payment, reduction or
satisfaction occurred.

     13.8 No Waiver.  No delay on the part of the Agent, the LC Issuer or the
          ---------
Lenders in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver
thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Agent, the LC Issuer or the
Lenders of any right, power or remedy shall preclude any further exercise
thereof; nor shall any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of any of
the terms or provisions of this Guaranty be binding upon the Agent, the LC
Issuer or the Lenders, except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed
and delivered on the LC Issuer and the Lenders' behalf by the Agent.  The
failure by the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders at any time or times
hereafter to require strict performance by TMK Re or the Borrower of any of the
provisions, warranties, terms and conditions contained in any promissory note,
security agreement, agreement, guaranty, instrument or document now or at any
time or times hereafter executed pursuant to the terms of, or in connection
with, this Agreement by TMK Re or the Borrower and delivered to the Agent, the
LC Issuer or the Lenders shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of the
Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders at any time or times hereafter to demand
strict performance thereof, and such right shall not be deemed to have been
waived by any act or knowledge of the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders, their
agents, officers or employees, unless such waiver is contained in an instrument
in writing duly signed and delivered on the LC Issuer and the Lenders' behalf by
the Agent.  No waiver by the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders of any default
shall operate as a waiver of any other default or the same default on a future
occasion, and no action by the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders permitted
hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the Agent's, the LC Issuer's or the
Lenders' rights or powers, or the obligations of the Borrower under this
Guaranty.  Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount
of any Guaranteed Debt owing by TMK Re to the LC Issuer and the Lenders shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower irrespective of whether the Borrower was
a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.

     13.9 Setoff.  In addition to and without limitation of any rights, powers
          ------
or remedies of the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders under applicable law, any
time after maturity of the Guaranteed Debt, whether by acceleration or
otherwise, the Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders may, in their sole
discretion, with notice after the fact to the Borrower and regardless of the
acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and
apply toward the

                                      -56-
<PAGE>

payment of the Guaranteed Debt (a) any indebtedness due or to become due from
any of the LC Issuer or the Lenders to the Borrower, and (b) any moneys, credits
or other property belonging to the Borrower (including all account balances,
whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) at any
time held by or coming into the possession of any of the Agent, the LC Issuer or
any Participant whether for deposit or otherwise.

     13.10  Severability.  Wherever possible, each provision of this Article
            ------------
XIII shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Article XIII shall be prohibited by
or invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Article XIII.

     13.11  Miscellaneous.  It is understood that while the amount of the
            -------------
Guaranteed Debt guaranteed hereby is not limited, if in any action or proceeding
involving any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency or other law
affecting the rights of creditors generally, this Guaranty would be held or
determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of the
aggregate liability under this Guaranty with respect to the Borrower, then,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the
aggregate amount of such liability shall, with respect to the Borrower, without
any further action of the Agent, the LC Issuer, the Lenders or any other Person,
be automatically limited and reduced with respect to the Borrower to the highest
amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or
proceeding.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Article XIII shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE XIV
                                    NOTICES

in this Section; provided that notices to the Agent under Article II shall not
be effective until received.

     14.2 Change of Address.  Each Credit Party, the Agent and any Lender may
          -----------------
each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to
the other parties hereto.

Issuer and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile
transmission or telephone that it has taken such action.

     Subject to the following two sentences, a particular Level Status shall
exist on a particular day if on such day the Borrower does not qualify for a
Level Status with more advantageous pricing  and either the Moody's Rating or
the S&P Rating is at least equal to the corresponding rating specified for such
Level Status in the table above.  In the event of a differential in Ratings of
one level, Level Status shall be determined by reference to the higher of the
two Ratings.  In the event of a differential in Ratings of more than one level,
the applicable
_________________

*    The Utilization Fee shall be payable only with respect to outstanding
     Advances on days when Utilization is greater than 33%. "Utilization" means,
     for any day, a percentage equal to the aggregate principal amount of Loans
     and Reimbursement Obligations hereunder and "Loans" (as defined in the 364-
     Day Agreement) outstanding on such day (and at the close of business on
     such day if a Business Day) divided by the sum on such day of the Aggregate
     Commitment and the "Aggregate Commitment" under the 364-Day Agreement;
     provided that for purposes of computing the Utilization Fee (a) the
     Aggregate Commitment shall be deemed to in no event be less than the
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans and the Reimbursement
     Obligations and (b) the Aggregate Commitment (as defined in the 364-Day
     Agreement) shall be deemed to in no event be less than the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of the "Loans" (as defined in the 364-Day
     Agreement).

Level Status shall be that Level Status one below the Level Status which would
have been applicable had the lower Rating been the same as the higher Rating.
The above ratings are in the format of S&P Rating/Moody's Rating.

     For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the following
meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

     "Level Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III
Status, Level IV Status or Level V Status.

     "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by
Moody's and then in effect.

     "Rating" means Moody's Rating or S&P Rating.

     "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by S&P and
then in effect.

     The Applicable Margin, Applicable Facility Fee Rate and Applicable Facility
LC Rate shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table based on the
Borrower's Status as determined from its then-current Moody's and S&P Ratings.
The Rating in effect on any date for the purposes of this Schedule is that in
effect at the close of business on such date.  If at any time the Borrower has
no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating or the Borrower does not qualify for a Level
Status with more advantageous pricing, Level V Status shall exist.
