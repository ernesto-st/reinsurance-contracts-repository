acceptable to the Company within 30 days after the Executive incurs such expense; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(v) the opportunity to&nbsp;elect the timing of

achievement of the specified performance targets. If the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the Retirement Date, the Company will not waive the employment conditions for vesting of any outstanding shares
of performance stock and all of the Executive&#146;s outstanding shares of performance stock will be forfeited to the extent provided by and in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant agreements. Moreover, no conditions of vesting of any
kind will be waived for grants made under equity plans, including without limitation, both the Performance Stock Plan and Stock Incentive Plan, other than the three specified grants, each of which has achieved the performance target required as a
condition of vesting, and which would otherwise require approximately one, two and four years more of employment, respectively, in order to satisfy the 15-year time-based vesting condition; rather, the shares represented by such grants shall be
forfeited at the Retirement Date. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;2(b) will affect the operation of any outstanding performance stock grant agreement or Performance Stock Plan provision relating to vesting in the
event of a change in control of the Company or the Employee&#146;s death or disability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) The Executive understands and agrees that the

this Section&nbsp;5, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief as well as any other applicable remedies at law or in equity. Executive understands and agrees that without such protection, the Company&#146;s business would be irreparably
harmed, and that the remedy of monetary damages alone would be inadequate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(iv) Executive acknowledges that the purposes of this
Section&nbsp;5 would be frustrated by measuring the period of restriction from the Retirement Date where Executive failed to honor the Agreement during the Restricted Period, as applicable, until directed to do so by court order. Therefore, should
Executive violate this Agreement and should legal proceedings have to be brought by the Company against Executive to enforce this Agreement, the period of restriction under this Section&nbsp;5 shall be deemed to be extended for a period equal to the
period of violation by Executive. </P>

<B>BROWN&nbsp;&amp; BROWN, INC.</B>, a Florida corporation (together with its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates, the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), and <B>CORY T. WALKER</B>, a resident of the State of Florida

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with Executive&#146;s retirement from the Company, the Company and the Executive executed and delivered a Transition Agreement
dated as of November &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2013 (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company was to provide certain monetary and other benefits to the Executive under certain circumstances, including his
execution and nonrevocation of this Supplement to such Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, the Company and the Executive, intending to
legally abound, agree as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>1. <U>The Executive&#146;s Release of the Company and Personnel</U></B>.<B> </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) In exchange for the monies and benefits given by the Company to the Executive under the Agreement to which he is not otherwise entitled,
the Executive agrees, on his own behalf and on behalf of any other person entitled to make a claim on his behalf or through him, that he hereby freely, finally, fully and forever releases and discharges the Company from any and all claims and causes
of action of any kind or nature that the Executive once had or now has against the Company, including all claims arising out of the Executive&#146;s employment or end of employment with the Company, whether such claims are now known or unknown to
the Executive (&#147;Released Claims&#148;). Released Claims do not include (i)&nbsp;any claims which by law may not be released by the Executive; (ii)&nbsp;any claims of the Executive for vested benefits under the Company&#146;s employee benefit
plans; and (iii)&nbsp;any claims related to the Company&#146;s performance of the Agreement. The Executive agrees that it is his intent that the releases of claims being given by him in this Supplement are intended to operate as a general release to
the maximum extent permitted by law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) The Executive realizes that there are many laws and regulations relating to employment,
including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; the Family and Medical Leave Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended; and various other federal, state and local constitutions, statutes, ordinances, human rights, discrimination, retaliation/whistleblower, wage payment laws, and common laws (including the laws of contract and tort), including any
applicable Florida discrimination, retaliation and wage payment laws. The Executive intends to fully and finally release the Company from any and all claims arising under such laws which he has or may have arising from events occurring prior to the
date on which he signs this Supplement except as set forth in the next-to-last sentence of the preceding paragraph above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) The
Executive agrees that he does not now have pending any claims or lawsuits against the Company, that he has not suffered an on-the-job injury for which he has not already filed a claim and that he will not in the future commence or join in any
lawsuit against the Company. Further, the Executive waives his right to any monetary recovery should any federal, state, or local administrative agency pursue any claims on his behalf arising out of or related to his employment with and/or
separation </P>

send a written notice of revocation to Robert W. Lloyd, Esq., General Counsel of the Company, so it is received not later than the close of business on the seventh day after he signed the Supplement. The Executive understands that, if he revokes
this Supplement, he will not receive any of the monies or benefits described in Section&nbsp;2 of the Agreement, except to the extent the Company otherwise is required to provide them as a matter of law. </P>

two separate taxable years, any payment of amounts under Section&nbsp;2(a)(iii) of the Agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A shall be payable on the later of (i)&nbsp;the date such payment is
