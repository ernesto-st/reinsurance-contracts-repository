     pending  or  contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of
     the  Commission  for  additional  information  has  been  complied  with.


<PAGE>
          At  the  respective  times the Registration Statement, any Rule 462(b)
     Registration  Statement  and  any  post-effective amendments thereto became

     Statement  and  any  amendments  and  supplements thereto complied and will
     comply  in  all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and
     did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
     to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the  statements  therein  not  misleading.  Neither  the  Prospectus,  any
     preliminary  prospectus,  nor any amendments or supplements thereto, at the
     time  such  preliminary  prospectus,  Prospectus  or  any such amendment or
     supplement  was  issued  and  at  the  Closing  Time  (and,  if  any Option
     Securities  are  purchased,  at  the  Date  of  Delivery), included or will
     include  an  untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to
     state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
     the  light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The  representations  and  warranties in this subsection shall not apply to
     statements  in  or  omissions  from  the  Registration  Statement,  any
     post-effective  amendment  thereto,  any  preliminary  prospectus,  the
     Prospectus,  or any amendments or supplements thereto made in reliance upon

     any  Underwriter  through  Keefe  Bruyette  expressly  for  use  in  the
     Registration  Statement,  preliminary  prospectus,  or  Prospectus.

          Each  preliminary  prospectus  and the prospectus filed as part of the
     Registration  Statement  as  originally  filed  or as part of any amendment
     thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, complied when so
     filed  in  all  material  respects  with  the 1933 Act and each preliminary
     prospectus  and  the  Prospectus  delivered  to the Underwriters for use in
     connection  with  this  offering  was  identical  to  the  electronically
     transmitted  copies  thereof  filed  with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR,
     except  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Regulation  S-T under the 1933 Act.

          (ii)  Independent  Registered  Public Accounting Firm. Joseph Decosimo
                -----------------------------------------------
     and  Company,  PLLC  ("Decosimo"),  the  accounting firm that certified the
                            --------
     financial  statements  and  supporting schedules of the Company included in
     the  Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, and the Prospectus
     is an independent registered public accounting firm as required by the 1933
     Act.  With  respect  to  the  Company,  Decosimo is not in violation of the
     auditor  independence  requirements  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002
     ("Sarbanes-Oxley  Act")  and  the  related  rules  and  regulations  of the
       -------------------
     Commission.

          (iii)  Financial  Statements. The financial statements included in the
                 ---------------------
     Registration  Statement,  any  preliminary  prospectus, and the Prospectus,
     together with the related schedules and notes, present fairly the financial
     position  of  the  Company  and  the Subsidiaries (as defined below) at the
     dates  indicated  and the statement of operations, stockholders' equity and
     cash  flows  of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the periods specified.
     Such  financial  statements and any supporting schedules have been prepared
     in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP")
                                                                          ----
     applied  on  a  consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except as
     may  be  expressly  stated in the related notes thereto, and except, in the
     case  of  the  interim  unaudited financial statements, for normal year-end
     adjustments  and  for  the  absence  of  footnotes  disclosure.  The


<PAGE>
     selected  financial  data and the summary financial information included in
     any  preliminary  prospectus  and/or  the  Prospectus  present  fairly  the
     information shown therein and have been compiled on a basis consistent with
     that  of  the  audited  financial  statements  included in the Registration
     Statement  (with  respect to the audited periods) and on a basis consistent
     with  that  of  the most recent interim financial statements filed with the
     Commission  (with  respect  to  unaudited periods). The pro forma financial
     statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included in the Registration
     Statement, any preliminary prospectus, and/or the Prospectus present fairly
     the  information  shown  therein, have been prepared in accordance with the
     Commission's  rules  and  guidelines  with  respect  to pro forma financial
     statements  and have been properly compiled on the basis described therein,
     and  the assumptions used in the preparation thereof are reasonable and the
     adjustments used therein are appropriate to give effect to the transactions
     and  circumstances  referred  to  therein. All disclosures contained in the
     Registration  Statement,  any  preliminary  prospectus,  or  the Prospectus
     regarding  "non-GAAP  financial  measures"  (as such term is defined by the
     rules  and  regulations  of the Commission) comply with Regulation G of the
     Securities  Exchange  Act  of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
     regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  the  "1934  Act")  and  Item  10  of
                                                  ---------
     Regulation  S-K  under  the  1933  Act,  to  the  extent  applicable.

          (iv)  No  Material  Adverse  Change  in Business. Since the respective
                ------------------------------------------
     dates  as  of  which information is given in the Registration Statement and

     (A)  there  has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial
     or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
     the  Company  and the Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or
     not  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  (a "Material Adverse
                                                                ----------------

     ------
     or  the  Subsidiaries, other than those in the ordinary course of business,
     which  are  material  with  respect  to  the  Company  and the Subsidiaries
     considered  as  one  enterprise,  and  (C)  there  has  been no dividend or

                     -----------------------------------------------

     (a)     Initial  Securities.  On  the  basis  of  the  representations  and
warranties  herein  contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set
forth,  the  Company  agrees  to  sell  to  each  Underwriter, severally and not
jointly,  and  each  Underwriter,  severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase
from the Company, at the price per share set forth in Schedule C, that number of
Initial  Securities  set  forth  in  Schedule  A  opposite  the  name  of  such
Underwriter,  plus  any  additional  number  of  Initial  Securities  which such
Underwriter  may  become  obligated  to  purchase  pursuant to the provisions of
Section  10  hereof,  subject,  in  each  case,  to  such  adjustments among the
Underwriters  as  the  Representative  in  its  sole  discretion  shall  make to
eliminate  any  sales  or  purchases  of  fractional  securities.

     (b)     Option  Securities.  In  addition,  on  the  basis  of  the
representations  and  warranties  herein  contained and subject to the terms and
conditions  herein  set  forth,  the  Company  hereby  grants  an  option to the
Underwriters,  severally  and  not  jointly,  to  purchase up to an aggregate of
675,000  additional  shares  of Common Stock, as set forth in Schedule B, at the
price  per  share set forth in Schedule C, less an amount per share equal to any
dividends  or  distributions  declared by the Company and payable on the Initial
Securities  but not payable on the Option Securities.  The option hereby granted
will  expire  30  days after the date hereof and may be exercised in whole or in
part  from  time  to time only for the purpose of covering over-allotments which
may  be  made  in  connection  with the offering and distribution of the Initial
Securities  upon  notice  by the Representative to the Company setting forth the
number  of  Option  Securities  as  to  which  the several Underwriters are then
exercising  the  option  and  the time and date of payment and delivery for such
Option  Securities.  Any  such  time and date of delivery (a "Date of Delivery")
                                                              ----------------
shall  be  determined  by  the Representative, but shall not be later than seven
full  business days after the exercise of said option, nor in any event prior to
the  Closing Time, as hereinafter defined.  If the option is exercised as to all
or  any  portion  of  the  Option  Securities,  each of the Underwriters, acting
severally  and not jointly, will purchase that proportion of the total number of
Option  Securities  then  being purchased which the number of Initial Securities
set forth in Schedule A opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the total
number  of  Initial  Securities, subject in each case to such adjustments as the
Representative  in its discretion shall make to eliminate any sales or purchases
of  fractional  shares.


<PAGE>
     (c)     Payment.  Payment  of  the  purchase  price  for,  and  delivery of
certificates  for, the Initial Securities shall be made at the offices of Alston
&  Bird,  LLP,  1201  West  Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, or at such
other  place  as  shall be agreed upon by the Representative and the Company, at
10:00 A.M. (Eastern time) on the third (fourth, if the pricing occurs after 4:30
P.M. (Eastern time) on any given day) business day after the date hereof (unless
postponed  in  accordance with the provisions of Section 10), or such other time
not  later than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the
Representative and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery being
herein  called  "Closing  Time").
                 -------------

     In  addition,  in  the  event  that any or all of the Option Securities are
purchased  by  the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery
of certificates for, such Option Securities shall be made at the above-mentioned
offices,  or  at  such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representative
and  the  Company,  on each Date of Delivery as specified in the notice from the
Representative  to  the  Company.

     Payment  shall  be  made  to  the  Company  by wire transfer of immediately
available  funds to a bank account designated by the Company against delivery to
the  Representative  for  the  respective  accounts  of  the  Underwriters  of
certificates  for the Securities to be purchased by them.  It is understood that
each  Underwriter  has authorized the Representative, for its account, to accept
delivery  of,  receipt  for,  and  make  payment  of the purchase price for, the
Initial  Securities  and  the  Option Securities, if any, which it has agreed to
purchase.  Keefe  Bruyette,  individually  and  not  as  representative  of  the
Underwriters,  may  (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase
price  for  the  Initial  Securities  or  the  Option  Securities, if any, to be
purchased  by  any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing
Time  or  the  relevant  Date  of Delivery, as the case may be, but such payment
shall  not  relieve  such  Underwriter  from  its  obligations  hereunder.

     (d)     Denominations; Registration.  The Securities to be purchased by the
Underwriter  hereunder, in definitive form, and in such authorized denominations
and  registered  in  such  names  as  Keefe  Bruyette  may request upon at least
forty-eight  hours'  prior  notice  to  the  Company shall be delivered by or on
behalf  of  the  Company  to  Keefe  Bruyette,  through  the  facilities  of the
Depository  Trust  Company ("DTC"), for the account of the Underwriters, against
                             ---
payment  by  or  on  behalf of the Underwriters of the purchase therefor by wire
transfer  of Federal (same day) funds to the account specified by the Company to
Keefe  Bruyette.  The  Company  will  cause  the  certificates  representing the
Securities  to be made available for checking and packaging at least twenty-four
hours prior to the Closing Time with respect thereto at the office of DTC or its
designated  custodian  (the  "Designated  Office").  The  time  and date of such
                              ------------------
delivery  and  payment  shall  be, with respect to the Initial Securities, 10:00
a.m.,  New York time, on the date specified by Keefe Bruyette or such other time
and  date as Keefe Bruyette and the Company may agree upon in writing, and, with
respect  to  the  Option  Securities,  10:00  a.m.,  New  York time, on the date
specified by Keefe Bruyette in the written notice given by Keefe Bruyette of the
Underwriter's  election  to  purchase such Option Securities, or such other time
and  date  as  Keefe  Bruyette  and  the  Company  may  agree  upon  in writing.

     SECTION  3.     Covenants  of the Company.  The Company covenants with each
                     -------------------------
Underwriter  as  follows:

     (a)     Compliance  with  Securities  Regulations  and Commission Requests.
The  Company, subject to Section 3(b), will comply with the requirements of Rule
430A  or  Rule  434, as applicable, and will notify the Representative promptly,
and  confirm the notice in writing, (i) when any post-effective amendment to the
Registration  Statement  shall  become  effective,  or  any  supplement  to  the
Prospectus  or any amended Prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt
of  any comments from the Commission, (iii) of any request by the Commission for
any  amendment  to  the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to
the  Prospectus  or  for additional information, and (iv) of the issuance by the
Commission  of  any  stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement,  of  any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus, or
of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any
of  such  purposes.  The  Company  will  promptly  effect  the filings necessary
pursuant  to  Rule  424(b)  and  will  take  such steps as it deems necessary to
ascertain  promptly  whether the form of prospectus transmitted for filing under
Rule  424(b) was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it
was  not,  it  will  promptly  file  such  prospectus.  The  Company  will  use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order and,
if  any  stop  order  is  issued,  to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest
possible  moment.

     (b)     Filing  of  Amendments.  The  Company  will give the Representative
notice  of  its  intention  to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration
Statement  (including any filing under Rule 462(b)) or any amendment, supplement
or  revision  to either the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at
the  time it became effective or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1933
Act,  the  1934 Act or otherwise, will furnish the Representative with copies of
any  such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or
use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the
Representative  or  counsel for the Underwriters shall have reasonably objected.

     (c)     Delivery  of Registration Statements.  The Company has furnished or
will  deliver  to  the  Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without
charge,  signed  copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of
each  amendment  thereto  (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by
reference  therein  and  documents  incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference  therein)  and  signed  copies  of  all  consents  and certificates of
experts,  and  will  also  deliver  to  the  Representative,  without  charge, a
conformed  copy  of  the  Registration Statement as originally filed and of each
amendment  thereto  (without exhibits) for each of the Underwriters.  The copies
of  the  Registration  Statement  and  each  amendment  thereto furnished to the
Underwriters  will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof
filed  with  the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by
Regulation  S-T  under  the  1933  Act.

     (d)     Delivery  of  Prospectuses.  The  Company  has  delivered  to  each
Underwriter,  without  charge,  as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as
such  Underwriter  reasonably  requested, and the Company hereby consents to the
use  of  such  copies  for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act.  The Company will
furnish  to  each  Underwriter,  without  charge,  during  the  period  when the
Prospectus  is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such
number  of  copies  of  the  Prospectus  (as  amended  or  supplemented) as such
Underwriter  may  reasonably


<PAGE>
request.  The  Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to
the  Underwriters  will  be  identical  to the electronically transmitted copies
thereof  filed  with  the  Commission  pursuant  to  EDGAR, except to the extent
permitted  by  Regulation  S-T  under  the  1933  Act.

     (e)     Continued Compliance with Securities Laws.  The Company will comply
with  the  1933  Act  and  the  1934  Act  so as to permit the completion of the
distribution  of  the  Securities  as  contemplated in this Agreement and in the
Prospectus.  If  at any time when a prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be
delivered  in  connection  with  sales of the Securities as contemplated by this
Agreement,  any  event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which
it  is  necessary,  in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or
for  the Company, to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the
Prospectus  in  order that the Prospectus will not include any untrue statements
of  a  material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing
at  the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the
reasonable  opinion  of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration
Statement  or  amend  or  supplement  the Prospectus in order to comply with the
requirements  of  the  1933  Act  in  connection with sales of the Securities as
contemplated  by this Agreement, the Company will promptly prepare and file with
the  Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment or supplement as may be
necessary  to  correct  such  statement  or omission or to make the Registration
Statement  or the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will
furnish  to  the  Underwriters  such  number  of  copies  of  such  amendment or
supplement  as  the  Underwriters  may  reasonably  request.

     (f)     Blue  Sky  Qualifications.  The  Company  will use its commercially
reasonable  efforts,  in  cooperation  with  the  Underwriters,  to  qualify the
Securities  for  offering  and sale under the applicable securities laws of such
states  and  other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representative may
reasonably  have  designated  in  writing and to maintain such qualifications in
effect  for  a  period of not less than one year from the later of the effective
date  of  the Registration Statement and any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement;
provided,  however,  that  the Company shall not be obligated to execute or file
any general consent to service of process or to qualify or register as a foreign
corporation  or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not
so  qualified, required to file such a consent, or to subject itself to taxation
in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so
subject.  In  each  U.S.  jurisdiction  in  which  the  Securities  have been so
qualified,  the Company will file such statements and reports as may be required
by  the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for a
period  of  not  less  than one year from the effective date of the Registration
Statement  and  any  Rule  462(b)  Registration  Statement.

     (g)     Rule  158.  The  Company  will timely file such reports pursuant to
the  1934  Act  as  are  necessary  in  order to make generally available to its
securityholders  as  soon  as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes
of,  and  to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section
11(a)  of  the  1933  Act.

     (h)     Use of Proceeds.  The Company will use the net proceeds received by
it  from  the  sale  of the Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus
under  "Use  of  Proceeds."


<PAGE>
     (i)     Listing.  The  Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to  effect  and  maintain the quotation of the Securities on the Nasdaq National
Market  and  will file with the Nasdaq National Market all documents and notices
required  by  the  Nasdaq National Market of companies that have securities that
are  traded in the over-the-counter market and quotations for which are reported
by  the  Nasdaq  National  Market.

     (j)     Restriction  on  Sale  of  Securities.  During a period of 180 days
from the date of the Prospectus (the "Restricted Period"), the Company will not,
                                      -----------------
without the prior written consent of Keefe Bruyette, directly or indirectly, (i)
offer,  pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase  any  option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase  or  otherwise  transfer or dispose of any share of Common Stock or any
securities  convertible  into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or
file  any  registration  statement under the 1933 Act with respect to any of the
foregoing  or  (ii)  enter  into  any  swap, hedge or any other agreement or any
transaction  that  transfers,  in  whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the
economic  consequence  of  ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such swap,
hedge  or  transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by
delivery  of  Common  Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise.  The
foregoing  sentence  shall not apply to (A) the Securities to be sold hereunder,
(B)  any  shares  of  Common Stock issued by the Company upon the exercise of an
option  or  warrant  outstanding  on  the  date  hereof  and  referred to in the
Prospectus  and  any  preliminary  prospectus, (C) any shares of Common Stock or
other  securities  issued,  options to purchase Common Stock or other securities

Common  Stock  or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for  Common Stock offered, pledged or contracted to be sold as consideration for
the  acquisition  by  the Company or any Subsidiary of the business or assets of
any  entity  not  controlled by any executive officer, director, or affiliate of
the  Company,  or  (E)  any  transfer,  sale or other disposition with the prior
written  consent  of  Keefe Bruyette.  Keefe Bruyette agrees not to provide such
consent  without  providing notice to each Underwriter to permit compliance with
applicable  provisions  of NASD Conduct Rule 2177(f) restricting publication and
distribution  of research and public appearances by research analysts before and
after  the  expiration,  waiver or termination of a lock-up agreement and agrees
only to provide consent in circumstances that will permit such compliance by the
Underwriters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that either (i) during
the  period  that  begins  on  the  date that is 15 calendar days plus three (3)
business  days before the last day of the Restricted Period and ends on the last
day of the Restricted Period, the Company issues an earnings release or material
news  or  a  material event relating to the Company occurs, or (ii) prior to the
expiration  of the Restricted Period, the Company announces that it will release
earnings  results  during  the  16-day  period  beginning on the last day of the
Restricted  Period,  the  restrictions  set  forth herein will continue to apply
until  the  expiration  of  the  date  that  is  15 calendar days plus three (3)
business  days  after  the  date  on which the earnings release is issued or the
material  news  or  event  related  to  the  Company  occurs.

     (k)     Reporting  Requirements.  The  Company,  during the period when the
Prospectus  is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will
file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934
Act within the time periods required by the 1934 Act (including as allowed to be
extended  pursuant  to  Form  12b-25  or  otherwise  under  the  1934  Act).


<PAGE>
     (l)     Compliance  with  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act.  During the time when a
Prospectus  is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, the Company shall at
all  times  comply,  in all material respects, with all applicable provisions of
the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the related rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder  by  the Commission and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., in effect from
time  to  time.

     (m)     Compliance  with  the  Cuba  Act.  In  accordance with that certain
Florida  Act relating to the disclosure of doing business with Cuba, codified as

any other party except as provided in Section 4 and except that Sections 1, 6, 7
and  8  shall  survive any such termination and remain in full force and effect.

     SECTION  6.     Indemnification.
                     ---------------

     (a)     Indemnification  of Underwriters.  The Company and the Subsidiaries
agree,  jointly  and  severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter
and  each  person,  if  any,  who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section  15  of  the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the extent and in
the  manner  set  forth  in  clauses  (i),  (ii)  and  (iii)  below:


<PAGE>
          (i)  against  any  and  all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
     whatsoever,  as  incurred,  arising  out of any untrue statement or alleged
     untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
     (or  any  amendment  thereto),  including the Rule 430A Information and the
     Rule  434  Information,  if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission
     therefrom  of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
     make  the  statements  therein  not misleading or arising out of any untrue
     statement  or  alleged  untrue statement of a material fact included in any
     preliminary  prospectus  or  the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
     thereto),  or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact
     necessary  in  order  to  make  the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not  misleading;

          (ii)  against  any  and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
     whatsoever,  as  incurred,  to  the  extent of the aggregate amount paid in
     settlement  of  any  litigation,  or any investigation or proceeding by any
     governmental  agency  or  body,  commenced  or  threatened, or of any claim
     whatsoever  based  upon  any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
     alleged  untrue  statement  or  omission; provided that (subject to Section
     6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the
     Company;  and

          (iii)  against  any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including
     the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Keefe Bruyette), reasonably
     incurred  in  investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation,
     or  any  investigation  or  proceeding  by any governmental agency or body,
     commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
     statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to
     the  extent  that  any  such  expense  is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;

provided,  however,  that  this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss,
--------   -------
liability,  claim,  damage  or  expense  to the extent arising out of any untrue
statement  or  omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance
upon  and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any
Underwriter  through  Keefe  Bruyette  expressly  for  use  in  the Registration
Statement  (or  any  amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information, if
applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement  thereto);  provided  further  that the parties acknowledge and agree
that  the  only  information  that  any Underwriter has furnished to the Company
specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus
and Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the last sentence of
the last paragraph on the front cover page of the Prospectus and the preliminary
prospectus  regarding  the  anticipated  delivery  date  of  the Securities, the
concession  and  reallowance  figures appearing in the Prospectus in the section
entitled  "Underwriting"  and  the  information  contained  under  the  captions
"Underwriting  -  Stabilization"  and  "Underwriting  -  Passive Market Making."

     (b)     Indemnification  of Company and Directors and Officers. Underwriter
severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each
of  its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any,
who  controls  the  Company  within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or
Section  20  of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage
and  expense  described  in  the  indemnity  contained in subsection (a) of this
Section,  as  incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions,
or  alleged


<PAGE>
untrue  statements  or  omissions,  made  in  the Registration Statement (or any
amendment  thereto),  including the Rule 430A Information, if applicable, or any
preliminary  prospectus  or  the  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or supplement
thereto)  in  reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to  the  Company by such Underwriter through Keefe Bruyette expressly for use in
the  Registration  Statement  (or  any  amendment  thereto)  or such preliminary
prospectus  or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), provided
that  the  parties  acknowledge and agree that the only written information that
any  Underwriter  has furnished to the Company specifically for inclusion in the
Registration  Statement, preliminary prospectus and Prospectus (or any amendment
or  supplement thereto) are the last sentence of the last paragraph on the front
cover  page  of  the  Prospectus  and  the  preliminary prospectus regarding the
anticipated  delivery  date  of  the  Securities, the concession and reallowance
figures  appearing in the Prospectus  in the section entitled "Underwriting" and
the  information contained under the captions "Underwriting - Stabilization" and
"Underwriting  -  Passive  Market  Making."

     (c)     Actions  against  Parties;  Notification.  Each  indemnified  party
shall  give  notice  as  promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying
party  of  any  action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be
sought  hereunder,  but  failure  to  so  notify an indemnifying party shall not
relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is
not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve
it  from  any  liability  which  it  may  have otherwise than on account of this
indemnity  agreement.  In  the  case  of parties indemnified pursuant to Section
6(a)  above,  counsel  to  the  indemnified  parties  shall be selected by Keefe
Bruyette,  and,  in  the  case  of  parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b)
above,  counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.  An
indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such
action;  provided,  however,  that  counsel  to the indemnifying party shall not
(except  with  the  consent  of  the  indemnified  party) also be counsel to the
indemnified  party.  In  no  event  shall the indemnifying parties be liable for
fees  and  expenses  of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel)
separate  from  their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with
any  one  action  or  separate  but  similar  or  related  actions  in  the same
jurisdiction  arising  out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  No
indemnifying  party  shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified
parties,  settle  or  compromise  or  consent  to the entry of any judgment with
respect  to  any  litigation,  or  any  investigation  or  proceeding  by  any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in
respect  of  which  indemnification  or  contribution could be sought under this
Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual
or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i)
includes  an  unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability
arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does
not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure
to  act  by  or  on  behalf  of  any  indemnified  party.

     (d)     Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse.  If at any time
an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the
indemnified  party  for  fees  and  expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party
agrees  that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by
Section  6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is
entered  into  more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the
aforesaid  request,  (ii)  such indemnifying party shall have received notice of
the  terms  of  such  settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being
entered  into  and  (iii)  such  indemnifying


<PAGE>
party  shall  not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such
request  prior  to  the  date  of  such  settlement.

     SECTION  7.     Contribution.  If  the  indemnification  provided  for  in
                     ------------
Section  6  hereof  is  for  any  reason  unavailable to or insufficient to hold
harmless  an  indemnified  party  in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims,
damages  or  expenses  referred  to  therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute  to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages
and  expenses  incurred  by  such  indemnified  party,  as incurred, (i) in such
proportion  as  is  appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering
of  the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided
by  clause  (i)  is  not  permitted  by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate  to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)
above  but  also  the  relative  fault of the Company on the one hand and of the
Underwriters  on  the  other hand in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well
as  any  other  relevant  equitable  considerations.

     The  relative  benefits  received  by  the  Company on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities
pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  be  deemed  to  be  in the same respective
proportions  as  the  total  net  proceeds  from  the offering of the Securities
pursuant  to  this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
and  the  total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case
as  set  forth  on  the  cover  of  the  Prospectus.

     The  relative  fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on
the  other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
any  such  untrue  or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Company  or  by  the  Underwriters  and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access  to  information  and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.

     The  Company  and  the  Underwriters  agree  that  it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata
allocation  (even  if  the  Underwriters  were  treated  as  one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable  considerations  referred  to  above in this Section 7.  The aggregate
amount  of  losses,  liabilities,  claims,  damages  and expenses incurred by an
indemnified  party  and  referred  to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to
include  any  legal  or  other  expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party  in  investigating,  preparing or defending against any litigation, or any
investigation  or  proceeding  by  any governmental agency or body, commenced or
threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue
statement  or  omission  or  alleged  omission.

     Notwithstanding  the  provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be
required  to  contribute  any  amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price  at  which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public
were  offered  to  the  public  exceeds  the  amount  of  any damages which such
Underwriter  has  otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or
alleged  untrue  statement  or  omission  or  alleged  omission.


<PAGE>
     No  person  guilty  of  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who  was  not  guilty  of  such  fraudulent  misrepresentation.

     For  purposes  of  this  Section  7,  each  person, if any, who controls an
Underwriter  within  the  meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of
the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and
each  director  of  the  Company,  each  officer  of  the Company who signed the
Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within
the  meaning  of  Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall
have  the  same  rights  to  contribution  as  the  Company.  The  Underwriters'
respective  obligations  to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in
proportion  to  the  number  of  Initial  Securities  set  forth  opposite their
respective  names  in  Schedule  A  hereto  and  not  joint.

     SECTION  8.     Representations,  Warranties  and  Agreements  to  Survive
                     ----------------------------------------------------------
Delivery.  All  representations,  warranties  and  agreements  contained in this
--------
Agreement  or  in  certificates  of  officers  of  the Company or any Subsidiary
submitted  pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect,
regardless  of  any  investigation  made  by  or on behalf of any Underwriter or
controlling  person,  or  by  or  on  behalf  of  the Company, and shall survive
delivery  of  the  Securities  to  the  Underwriters.

     SECTION  9.     Termination  of  Agreement.
                     --------------------------

     (a)     Termination;  General.  The  Representative  may  terminate  this
Agreement,  by written notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing
Time  (i)  if  there  has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or
since  the  respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus,
any  Material  Adverse Effect, or (ii) if there has occurred (A) any outbreak or
escalation  of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the
United  States  of  a  national  emergency  or war, or (B) any other calamity or
crisis  or  any  change  in  financial,  political or economic conditions in the
United  States  or  elsewhere,  including  without  limitation,  as  a result of
terrorist  activities occurring after the date hereof, if the effect of any such
event  specified  in  (A)  or (B) in the judgment of the Representative makes it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery
of  the  Securities  being delivered at the Date of Delivery on the terms and in
the  manner contemplated in the Prospectus (iii) if trading in any securities of
the  Company  has  been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the
Nasdaq  National  Market, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange
or  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  in  the Nasdaq National Market has been
suspended  or  materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have
been  fixed,  or  maximum  ranges  for prices have been required, by any of said
exchanges  or  by  such  system  or  by  order  of  the Commission, the National
Association  of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or
(iv)  if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York or
Tennessee  authorities  or  a  material  disruption  in  commercial  banking  or
securities  settlement  or clearance services in the United States has occurred.

     (b)     Liabilities.  If  this  Agreement  is terminated in accordance with
this  Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any
other  party  except  as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that
Sections  1,  6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force
and  effect.


<PAGE>
     SECTION 10.     Default by One or More of the Underwriters.  If one or more
                     ------------------------------------------
of the Underwriters shall fail at Closing Time or a Date of Delivery to purchase
the  Securities  which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement
(the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24
      --------------------
hours  thereafter,  to  make  arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting
Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all,
of  the  Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the
terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed
such  arrangements  within  such  24-hour  period,  then:

     (a)     if  the  number  of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the
number  of  Securities  to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting
Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full
amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations
hereunder  bear  to  the  underwriting  obligations  of  all  non-defaulting
Underwriters,  or

     (b)     if  the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number of
Securities  to be purchased on such date, this Agreement or, with respect to any
Date  of  Delivery  which  occurs  after the Closing Time, the obligation of the
Underwriters  to purchase and of the Company to sell the Option Securities to be
purchased and sold on such Date of Delivery shall terminate without liability on
the  part  of  any  non-defaulting  Underwriter.

     No  action  taken  pursuant  to  this  Section shall relieve any defaulting
Underwriter  from  liability  in  respect  of  its  default.

     In  the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of
this  Agreement or, in the case of a Date of Delivery which is after the Closing
Time,  which  does  not  result  in  a  termination  of  the  obligation  of the
Underwriters to purchase and the Company to sell the relevant Option Securities,
as the case may be, either (i) the Representative or (ii) the Company shall have
the right to postpone Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case
may  be,  for  a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required
changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or
arrangements.  As  used  herein,  the  term  "Underwriter"  includes  any person
                                              -----------
substituted  for  an  Underwriter  under  this  Section  10.

     SECTION  11.     Default  by  the  Company.  If  the  Company shall fail at
                      -------------------------
Closing Time or at the Date of Delivery to sell the number of Securities that it
is  obligated to sell hereunder, then this Agreement shall terminate without any
liability  on  the  part of any nondefaulting party; provided, however, that the
provisions  of  Sections 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8 shall remain in full force and effect.
No  action  taken  pursuant  to  this  Section  shall  relieve  the Company from
liability,  if  any,  in  respect  of  such  default.

     SECTION  12.     Notices.  All  notices  and other communications hereunder
                      -------
shall  be  in  writing  and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or
transmitted  by  any  standard  form  of  telecommunication.  Notices  to  the
Underwriters shall be directed to the Representative at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods,
Inc.,  787  Seventh  Avenue,  4th  Floor, New York, New York 10019, attention of
General  Counsel;  notices  to  the  Company  shall  be  directed to it at First

                      -------
be  binding  upon  the  Underwriters  and  the  Company  and  their  respective
successors.  Nothing  expressed  or  mentioned  in this Agreement is intended or
shall  be  construed  to  give  any  person, firm or corporation, other than the
Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors and the controlling
persons  and  officers  and  directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their
heirs  and  legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under  or  in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.  This
Agreement  and  all  conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the
sole  and  exclusive  benefit  of  the  Underwriters  and  the Company and their
respective  successors,  and said controlling persons and officers and directors
and  their  heirs  and  legal  representatives,  and for the benefit of no other
person,  firm  or  corporation.  No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter
shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  successor  by  reason  merely  of  such  purchase.

     SECTION  14.     GOVERNING  LAW AND TIME.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED
                      -----------------------

                      FORM OF OPINION OF COMPANY'S COUNSEL
                           TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO
                                  SECTION 5(b)

     (i)     The  Company  is  a  registered bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), and has been duly incorporated
                                          ----
and  is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the
State  of  Tennessee.  The  activities of each of the Company's subsidiaries are
permissible  for  a  subsidiary  of  a  bank  holding  company.

     (ii)     The  Company  has  the corporate power and authority to own, lease
and  operate  its  properties  and  to  conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus  and  to  enter  into  and perform its obligations under the Purchase
Agreement.

     (iii)     The  Company  is  duly  qualified  or  authorized  as  a  foreign
corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which  such  qualification  is  required,  whether by reason of the ownership or
leasing  of  property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to
qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (iv)     The  authorized,  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock  of the
Company  is as set forth in the Prospectus in the column entitled "Actual" under
the  caption "Capitalization" (except for subsequent issuances, if any, pursuant
to  the  Purchase  Agreement or pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee
benefit  plans  referred  to  in  the  Prospectus or pursuant to the exercise of
convertible  securities or options referred to in the Prospectus); the shares of
issued  and  outstanding  capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized
and  validly  issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; and to our knowledge
after  due  inquiry,  none  of  the  outstanding  shares of capital stock of the
Company was issued in violation of the preemptive or other similar rights of any
securityholder  of  the  Company.

     (v)     The Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company
have  been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the Underwriters pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to
the  Purchase  Agreement  against  payment of the consideration set forth in the
Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and
no  holder  of  the Securities is or will be subject to personal liability under
the  Tennessee  Business  Corporation  Act  by  reason  of  being such a holder.

     (vi)     The  issuance  and  sale  of  the Securities by the Company is not
subject  to  the preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the
Company.

     (vii)     FSGBank,  National  Association  has  been  duly organized and is
validly  existing  as  a  national  bank  in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction  of  its organization, and each other subsidiary of the Company has
been  duly  incorporated  and,


<PAGE>
except  for  Premier  National  Services, Inc. ("PNS"), is validly existing as a
                                                 ---
corporation  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of  the  jurisdiction  of its
incorporation.  Each  subsidiary  of  the  Company  other than PNS has the power
(corporate  or otherwise) and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified
or  authorized  as  a  foreign  corporation  to transact business and is in good
standing  in  each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether
by  reason  of  the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business,
except  where  the  failure  so  to  qualify or to be in good standing would not
result  in  a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock  of  each subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully
paid  and  non-assessable (except as otherwise provided in 12 U.S.C. Section 55)
and,  to  our  knowledge,  is  owned  by  the  Company,  directly  or  through
subsidiaries,  free  and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien,
encumbrance,  claim  or equity; to our knowledge, none of the outstanding shares
of  capital stock of any subsidiary was issued in violation of the preemptive or
similar  rights  of  any  securityholder  of  such  subsidiary.

     (viii)     The  Purchase  Agreement  has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by  the  Underwriters,  will  constitute  the valid and binding agreement of the
Company  enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
may  be  limited  or  otherwise  affected  by  (A)  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium,  fraudulent  conveyance  or other similar statutes,
rules,  regulations or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
and  remedies  generally,  and  (B)  the unavailability of, or limitation on the
availability of, a particular right or remedy (whether in a proceeding in equity
or  at law) because of an equitable principle, public policy or a requirement as
to  commercial  reasonableness,  conscionability  or  good  faith.

     (ix)     The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration
Statement,  has  been declared effective under the 1933 Act; any required filing
of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within
the  time  period required by Rule 424(b); and, to the best of our knowledge, no
stop  order  suspending  the  effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any
Rule  462(b)  Registration  Statement  has been issued under the 1933 Act and no
proceedings  for  that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened
by  the  Commission.

     (x)     The  Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration
Statement and the Rule 430A Information, as applicable, the Prospectus, and each
amendment  or  supplement  to the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus
and Prospectus (other than (a) the financial statements and notes and supporting
schedules included therein or omitted therefrom and (b) the information provided
by  the  Representative,  including  the  concession  and  reallowance  figures
appearing  in  the  Prospectus  in  the  section entitled "Underwriting" and the
information  contained  under  the  captions  "Underwriting - Stabilization" and
"Underwriting - Passive Market Making", as to which we need express no opinion),
as  of  their  respective  effective  or issue dates, complied as to form in all
material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  1933  Act.


                                      A - 2
<PAGE>
     (xi)     The form of certificate used to evidence the Common Stock complies
in  all  material  respects with all applicable statutory requirements, with any
applicable  requirements  of  the  charter  and  by-laws  of the Company and the
requirements  of  the  Nasdaq  National  Market.

     (xii)     To  our knowledge, there is not pending or threatened any action,
suit,  proceeding,  inquiry  or  investigation,  to  which  the  Company  or any
subsidiary is a party, or to which the property of the Company or any subsidiary
is  subject,  before  or  brought  by  any court or governmental agency or body,
domestic  or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse  Effect,  or  which  might  reasonably  be  expected  to  materially and
adversely affect the properties or assets thereof considered in the aggregate or
that could adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated in
the  Purchase  Agreement  or  the  performance by the Company of its obligations
thereunder.

     (xiii)     The  information  in  the  Prospectus  under  "Risk  Factors,"
"Description  of  Capital  Stock"  and  "Underwriting"  and  in the Registration
Statement  under  Item  14,  in  each instance to the extent that it constitutes
matters  of law, summaries of legal matters, the Company's charter and bylaws or
legal  proceedings,  or  legal  conclusions,  have  been  reviewed by us and are
accurate  and  complete  in  all  material  respects.

     (xiv)     To  our  knowledge, there are no statutes or regulations that are
required  to  be described in the Prospectus that are not described as required.

     (xv)     All  descriptions  in  the Registration Statement of contracts and
other  documents  to  which  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries are a party are
accurate  in  all  material respects; to our knowledge, there are no franchises,
contracts,  indentures,  mortgages,  loan  agreements,  notes,  leases  or other
instruments  required  to  be  described  or  referred  to  in  the Registration
Statement  or  to  be  filed  as  exhibits thereto other than those described or
referred  to  therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto,
and  the descriptions thereof or references thereto are accurate in all material
respects.

     (xvi)     Except  for  the  administrative  dissolution of PNS, neither the
Company nor any subsidiary is in violation of its charter or by-laws, and to our
knowledge,  no  default  by  the  Company  or  any  subsidiary exists in the due
performance  or  observance  of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition
contained  in  any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or
other  agreement  or  instrument  that  is  described  or  referred  to  in  the
Registration  Statement  or the Prospectus or filed or incorporated by reference
as  an exhibit to the Registration Statement, which would individually or in the
aggregate  have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect.

     (xvii)     No  filing  with,  or authorization, approval, consent, license,
order,  registration,  qualification  or  decree  of,  any court or governmental
authority  or agency other than under the 1933 Act, which have been obtained (or
as  may  be required (a) under the rules and regulations of the NASD, (b) by any
foreign  governmental  entity or of the laws, rules or regulation of any foreign
jurisdiction or (c) under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states,
as  to  which  in  each  case  we  need  express  no  opinion)


                                      A - 3
<PAGE>
is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and
delivery  of  the  Purchase  Agreement  or  for  the offering, issuance, sale or
delivery  of  the  Securities.

     (xviii)     The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  of  the  Purchase
Agreement  and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase
Agreement  and in the Registration Statement (including the issuance and sale of
the  Securities  and  the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as
described  in the Prospectus under the caption "Use Of Proceeds") and compliance
by the Company with its obligations under the Purchase Agreement do not and will
not,  whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, (a)
to  our  knowledge,  conflict  with  or  constitute  a  breach of, or default or
Repayment  Event  (as  defined  in  Section 1(a)(xii) of the Purchase Agreement)
under or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance
upon  any  property  or  assets of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to any
contract,  indenture,  mortgage,  deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note,
lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to us, to which the Company or
any  subsidiary  is  a  party  or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to
which  any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject
(except  for  such  conflicts,  breaches  or  defaults  or  liens,  charges  or
encumbrances  that  would not have a Material Adverse Effect), (b) result in any
violation  of  the  provisions  of  the charter or by-laws of the Company or any
subsidiary,  (c)  result  in  any  violation  or  breach  of any applicable law,
statute,  rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to us, of any
government,  government  instrumentality  or  court, domestic or foreign, having
jurisdiction  over  the  Company  or  any  subsidiary or any of their respective
properties,  assets  or  operations.

     (xix)     The  Company  is  not and after giving effect to the offering and
sale  of  the  Securities and the use of proceeds, an "investment company" or an
entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the
1940  Act.

     (xx)     To  our knowledge, without independent investigation and except as
set  forth  on Schedule I hereto, neither the Company nor FSGBank (a) is a party
to  or  subject  to any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding or
similar  arrangement with, or a commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
submission  to,  any  governmental  entity  charged  with  the  supervision  or
regulation  of  depository  institutions or engaged in the insurance of deposits
(including  the  FDIC)  or  the  supervision  or  regulation of it or any of its
subsidiaries  and (b) has been advised by any such governmental entity that such
governmental  entity  is  contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering
the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement,
memorandum  of  understanding,  commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
submission.

     (xxi)     With  respect  to  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002:

          (A)  The  Company has adopted a Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct for
     senior  financial  officers meeting the requirements of 17 CFR Part 228.406
     and  an  audit  committee  charter  meeting  the  requirements  of  Rule
     4350(d)(1)(C)  of  the  Nasdaq  Marketplace  Rules;


                                      A - 4
<PAGE>
          (B) The Company's Board of Directors has determined that a majority of
     its members and all of the members of its compensation and audit committees
     are independent under applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, and based solely
     on  our  review  of written representations furnished by such directors, to
     our  knowledge  no independent director of the Company has any relationship
     prohibited  under Rule 4200(a)(15)(A) through (G) of the Nasdaq Marketplace
     Rules  and  no audit committee member has any relationship prohibited under
     Rule  4350(d)(2)(a)(1)  of  the  Nasdaq  Marketplace  Rules;

          (C)  The  Board  of  Directors  has  adopted  a  policy  regarding the
     nominations  process  pursuant  to  Rule  4350(b)(4)(B)  of  the  Nasdaq
     Marketplace  Rules  that  provides  for  the  nomination  of  directors  in
     accordance  with  such  rules;  and

          (D)  The  certifications  pursuant  to  Section  302  and  906  of the
     Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  contained  in the Company's periodic reports
     filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") since August 14,
                                                          ---
     2002, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
     such Act and the SEC regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, however,
     that  we  do not give any opinion as to the accuracy of the content of such
     certifications.

     (xxii)     To  our knowledge, the Company and FSGBank have not received any
communication from any governmental entity asserting that the Company or FSGBank
is  not  currently  in  compliance  with  any  statute,  law,  rule, regulation,
decision,  directive  or  order.

          In  addition,  although  we  do  not assume any responsibility for the
accuracy,  completeness  or  fairness  of  the  statements  contained  in  the
Registration  Statement  or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in this
opinion  in  subsections  (iv),  (xiii), (xiv) and (xv), nothing has come to our
attention  that  would lead us to believe that the Registration Statement or any
amendment  thereto, including the Rule 430A Information (if applicable), (except
for  financial  statements  and  schedules  and other financial data included or
omitted  therefrom,  as  to  which  we need make no statement), at the time such
Registration  Statement  or  any  such  amendment became effective, contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to  be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
or  that  the  Prospectus  or  any  amendment  or supplement thereto (except for
financial  statements and schedules and other financial data included or omitted
therefrom,  as  to  which we need make no statement), at the time the Prospectus
was  issued,  at the time any such amended or supplemented prospectus was issued
or  at  the Closing Time, included or includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements  therein,  in  the  light  of the circumstances under which they were
made,  not  misleading.

          In  rendering  such  opinions,  such counsel may rely as to matters of
fact  (but  not  as  to  legal  conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on
certificates  of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.  Such
opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is
otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to
legal  opinions,  including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the
ABA Section of Business Law (1991).  "Knowledge" shall include the meaning after
due  inquiry,  except  where  the  context  otherwise  requires.
