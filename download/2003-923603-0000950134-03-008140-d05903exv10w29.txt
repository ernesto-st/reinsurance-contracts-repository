telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to Borrower as soon as
reasonably practical, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to
the last day of the then current Interest Period. If such notice is given, the
Loan shall bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate beginning on the first day of
the next succeeding Interest Period. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Borrower have the right to elect to
have the Loan bear interest at either the Eurodollar Rate or the Adjusted Prime
Rate.

      (b) If any requirement of law or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall hereafter make it unlawful for
Lender in good faith to make or maintain the portion of the Loan bearing
interest at the Eurodollar Rate, (I) the obligation of Lender hereunder to make
the Loan bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate shall be canceled forthwith and
(II) the Loan shall automatically bear interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate on
the next succeeding Payment Date or within such earlier period as required by
Applicable Law. Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay Lender (within ten (10)
days of Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate Lender for any reasonable costs incurred by Lender in making any
conversion in accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order
to make or maintain the Loan hereunder. Upon written demand from Borrower,
Lender shall demonstrate in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to


                                      -26-
<PAGE>
Lender's determination and the calculation substantiating the Adjusted Prime
Rate and any additional costs incurred by Lender in making the conversion.
Lender's written notice of such costs, as certified to Borrower, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

      (c) In the event that any change in any requirement of any Applicable Law
or in the interpretation or application thereof, or compliance in good faith by
Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
hereafter issued from any Governmental Authority, in each such case, which is
generally applicable to all Lenders subject to such Governmental Authority's
jurisdiction:

            (i) shall hereafter impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
      special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
      held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
      advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
      acquisition of funds by, any U.S. office of Lender which is not otherwise
      included in the determination of LIBOR hereunder;

            (ii) shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the Eurodollar
      Rate, hereafter have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender's
      capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below
      that which Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
      compliance (taking into consideration Lender's policies with respect to
      capital adequacy) by any amount deemed by Lender to be material; or

            (iii) shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the Eurodollar
      Rate, hereafter impose on Lender any other condition, the result of which
      is to increase the cost to Lender of making, renewing or maintaining loans
      or extensions of credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder by
      any amount deemed by Lender to be material;

then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay Lender (within ten (10) days
of Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which
Lender deems to be material. If Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.2.3(c), Lender shall provide Borrower with
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the event or circumstance by
reason of which it has become so entitled and the additional amount required to
fully compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount. A
certificate as to any additional costs or amounts payable pursuant to the
foregoing sentence submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. This provision shall survive payment of the Note and the
satisfaction of all other obligations of Borrower under the Note, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

      (d) Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender and to hold Lender harmless from
any loss or expense which Lender sustains or incurs to the extent it is a
consequence of (I) any default by Borrower in payment of the principal of or
interest on the Loan while bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, including,
without limitation, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees
payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the
Eurodollar Rate, (II) any prepayment (whether voluntary or mandatory) of the
Loan on a day that (A) is not the Payment Date immediately following the last
day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or (B) is the Payment Date
immediately following the last day of an Interest Period with respect


                                      -27-
<PAGE>
thereto if Borrower did not give the prior written notice of such prepayment
required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders
of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the Eurodollar Rate hereunder and
(III) the conversion (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or
involuntary) of the Applicable Interest Rate from the Eurodollar Rate to the
Adjusted Prime Rate with respect to any portion of the outstanding principal
amount of the Loan then bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate on a date other
than the Payment Date immediately following the last day of an Interest Period,
including, without limitation, such loss or expenses arising from interest or
fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain
the Eurodollar Rate hereunder (the amounts referred to in clauses (I), (II) and
(III) are herein referred to collectively as the "Breakage Costs"). This
provision shall survive payment of the Note and the satisfaction of all other
obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      2.2.4 Payment on Maturity Date.

      Borrower shall pay to Lender on (or, to the extent permitted herein,
before) the Maturity Date the outstanding principal balance, all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Note,
the Pledge Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, all interest that would accrue on the outstanding principal balance
of the Loan through and including the end of the Interest Period in which the
Maturity Date occurs (even if such Interest Period extends beyond the Maturity
Date).

      2.2.5 Payments after Default.

      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect
of the Loan, shall accrue at the Default Rate, calculated from the date such
payment was due without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein.
Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the
default until the actual receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion
thereof that is then due). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, interest
at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall itself accrue interest at
the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the Pledge Agreement. This
paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date
of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy
accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default.

      2.2.6 Late Payment Charge.

      If any principal, interest or any other sums due under the Loan Documents
is not paid by Borrower on the date on which it is due, Borrower shall pay to
Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of such
unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law in order to defray
the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent
payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent
payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Pledge Agreement and the other
Loan Documents to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; provided, however,
Borrower shall have the option, not to be exercised more than three (3) times
during the term of the Loan, to not pay


                                      -28-
<PAGE>
the late payment charge contemplated by this Section 2.2.6 in the event any
Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount is paid within one (1) Business Day after
the date the same was due.

      2.2.7 Usury Savings.

      This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that at
no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the principal
balance of the Loan at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the
terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time
required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at
a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Applicable Interest Rate or the
Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to
the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on
account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to
Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

      2.2.8 Foreign Taxes.

      If the Loan is bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, all payments made
by Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for
or on account of, Foreign Taxes, excluding, in the case of Lender, Foreign Taxes
measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is resident or organized, or any
political subdivision thereof and, in the case of Lender, taxes measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of
Lender's lending office or any political subdivision thereof or in which Lender
is resident or engaged in business. If any non-excluded Foreign Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to Lender hereunder, the
amounts so payable to Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield
to Lender (after payment of all non-excluded Foreign Taxes) interest or any such
other amounts payable hereunder at the rate or in the amounts specified
hereunder. Whenever any non-excluded Foreign Tax is payable pursuant to
Applicable Law by Borrower, Borrower shall send to Lender an original official
receipt showing payment of such non-excluded Foreign Tax or other evidence of
payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender
for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by
Lender which may result from any failure by Borrower to pay any such
non-excluded Foreign Tax when due to the appropriate taxing authority or any
failure by Borrower to remit to Lender the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, provided, however, in the event that Lender or any
successor and/or assign of Lender is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof Lender agrees that, prior to the
first date on which any payment is due such entity hereunder, it will deliver to
Borrower (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case may be,
certifying in each case that such entity is entitled to receive payments under
the Note, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, or (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or successor applicable
form, as the case may be, to establish an


                                      -29-
<PAGE>
exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each entity required to
deliver to Borrower a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or Form W-9 pursuant to the
preceding sentence further undertakes to deliver to Borrower two further copies
of the said letter and W-8BEN or W-8ECI or Form W-9, or successor applicable
forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the
date that any such letter or form expires (which, in the case of the Form
W-8ECI, is the last day of each U.S. taxable year of the non-U.S. entity) or
becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent letter and form previously delivered by it to Borrower, and such
other extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by Borrower,
certifying in the case of a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI that such entity is entitled
to receive payments under the Note without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes, unless in any such case an event (including,
without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior
to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders
all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such entity from duly
completing and delivering any such letter or form with respect to it and such
entity advises Borrower that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax, and in the case of
a Form W-9, establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such entity fails to provide a duly completed
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form and, under Applicable Law, in
order to avoid liability for Foreign Taxes, Borrower is required to withhold on
payments made to such entity that has failed to provide the applicable form,
Borrower shall be entitled to withhold the appropriate amount of Foreign Taxes.
In such event, Borrower shall promptly provide to such entity evidence of
payment of such Foreign Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and shall
promptly forward to such entity any official tax receipts or other documentation
with respect to the payment of the Foreign Taxes as may be issued by the taxing
authority.

      2.2.9 Extension of Mortgage Loan.

      Upon Lender's written request to Borrower ("Mortgage Loan Extension
Request"), Borrower shall be required to take all steps necessary to cause
Mortgage Borrower to extend the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Mortgage
Loan Agreement. If Lender shall have given the Mortgage Loan Extension Request,
not later than ten (10) days before the latest date that Mortgage Borrower may
effectively give the notice of its exercise of the Mortgage Loan Extension
Option under the Mortgage Loan Agreement, Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower
to notify Mortgage Lender ("Mortgage Loan Extension Notice") that Mortgage
Borrower has elected to exercise the Mortgage Loan Extension Option (with a
simultaneous copy to Lender) and Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to take
all other steps (and make all other payments) necessary in order to exercise the
Mortgage Loan Extension Option. If Lender shall have given the Mortgage Loan
Extension Request, the failure of Borrower to cause Mortgage Borrower to give
the Mortgage Loan Extension Notice and take all other steps necessary to
exercise the Mortgage Loan Extension Option Loan in accordance with this Section
and the Mortgage Loan Documents shall be an automatic Event of Default (with no
notice, cure or grace period). If Borrower fails to give the Mortgage Loan
Extension Notice within such time, Borrower hereby authorizes Lender, and grants
Lender an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest, to give such
Mortgage Loan Extension Notice on behalf of and in the name of Mortgage
Borrower, and take all other steps as may be necessary to exercise the Mortgage
Loan Extension Option.

      SECTION 2.3 Prepayments.

      2.3.1 Voluntary Prepayments.

      Except as otherwise provided herein, Borrower shall not have the right to
prepay the Loan in whole or in part prior to the Payment Date occurring in
November, 2003 (the "Lockout Period"). On any Payment Date occurring after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, Borrower may, at its option, prepay the Loan
in whole, but not in part, upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

      (a) Borrower shall provide prior written notice to Lender specifying the
date (the "Prepayment Date") upon which the prepayment is to be made, which
notice shall be delivered to Lender not less than thirty (30) Business Days
prior to such payment;

      (b) Borrower shall pay to Lender, simultaneously with such prepayment, (i)
if such prepayment occurs prior to the Payment Date occurring in May, 2004 (the
"Open Date"), a prepayment premium equal to one percent (1%) of the original
principal amount of the Loan, (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest calculated at
the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of principal being prepaid through
and including the Prepayment Date together with an amount equal to the interest
that would have accrued at the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of
principal being prepaid through the end of the Interest Period in which such
prepayment occurs, notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the
date of prepayment, (the "Interest Shortfall"), (iii) Breakage Costs, if any,
without duplication of any sums paid pursuant to the preceding clause (ii); and
(iv) all other sums then due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan
Documents;

      (c) Mortgage Borrower simultaneously prepays the Mortgage Loan in
accordance with the provisions of Mortgage Loan Agreement; and

      (d) Junior Mezzanine Borrower simultaneously prepays the Junior Mezzanine
Loan in accordance with the provisions of the Junior Mezzanine Loan Agreement.

      This Section 2.3.1 shall not apply to prepayments made in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.5 hereof.

      2.3.2 Liquidation Events.

      (a) In the event of (i) any Casualty to all or any portion of any
Individual Property, (ii) any Condemnation of all or any portion of any
Individual Property, (iii) a Transfer of any Individual Property in connection
with realization thereon by the Mortgage Lender following an Event of Default
under the Mortgage Loan, including without limitation a foreclosure sale, or
(iv) any refinancing of any Individual Property or the Mortgage Loan (each, a
"Liquidation Event"), Borrower shall cause the related Net Liquidation Proceeds
After Debt Service to be deposited directly into an account designated by
Lender. On each date on which Lender actually receives a distribution of Net
Liquidation Proceeds After Debt Service, if such date is a Payment Date, such
Net Liquidation Proceeds After Debt Service shall be applied to the outstanding
principal balance of the Note in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%)
of such Net Liquidation Proceeds After Debt Service, together with interest that
would have accrued on such


                                      -31-
<PAGE>
amount through the next Payment Date and all other sums then due. In the event
Lender receives a distribution of Net Liquidation Proceeds After Debt Service on
a date other than a Payment Date, such amounts shall be held by Lender as
collateral security for the Loan in an interest bearing account, with such
interest accruing to the benefit of Borrower, and shall be applied by Lender on
the next Payment Date.

      (b) Borrower shall immediately notify Lender of any Liquidation Event once
Borrower has knowledge of such event. Borrower shall be deemed to have knowledge
of (i) a sale (other than a foreclosure sale) of any Individual Property on the
date on which a contract of sale for such sale is entered into, and a
foreclosure sale, on the date notice of such foreclosure sale is given, and (ii)
a refinancing of any Individual Property, on the date on which a commitment for
such refinancing is entered into. The provisions of this Section 2.3.2 shall not
be construed to contravene in any manner the restrictions and other provisions
regarding refinancing of the Mortgage Loan or Transfer of the Property or the
Collateral set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      2.3.3 Prepayments After Default.

      If, following an uncured Event of Default, Borrower tenders payment of all
or any part of the Debt, or if all or any portion of the Debt is recovered by
Lender after such Event of Default such tender or recovery shall be deemed a
voluntary prepayment by Borrower in violation of the prohibition against
prepayment of the Loan prior to the expiration of the Lockout Period and
Borrower shall pay, in addition to the Debt, (i) all accrued and unpaid interest
calculated at the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of principal being
prepaid through and including the Prepayment Date together with an amount equal
to the interest that would have accrued at the Applicable Interest Rate on the
amount of principal being prepaid through the end of the Interest Period in
which such prepayment occurs, notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends
beyond the date of prepayment, (ii) if such prepayment occurs prior to the
expiration of the Open Period, a prepayment consideration equal to five percent
(5%) of the amount being prepaid, (iii) the Interest Shortfall, if applicable,
with respect to the amount prepaid, (iv) Breakage Costs, if any, without
duplication of any sums paid pursuant to the preceding clause (iii); and (v) all
other sums due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents in
connection with a partial or total prepayment.

      2.3.4 Making of Payments.

      Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be made in
funds settled through the New York Clearing House Interbank Payments System or
other funds immediately available to Lender by 12:00 p.m., New York City time,
on or prior to the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such
account as Lender may designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any
payment hereunder or under the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is
not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the first Business Day
succeeding such scheduled due date.


                                      -32-
<PAGE>
      2.3.5 Application of Prepayments.

      All prepayments received pursuant to this Section 2.3 and Section 2.5
shall be applied first, to interest on the outstanding principal balance being
prepaid that accrued through and including the Prepayment Date, second, to
interest on the outstanding principal balance being prepaid that would have
accrued through the end of the Interest Period in which the prepayment occurred,
notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the date of prepayment,
and third, to the payments of principal due under the Loan in the inverse order
of maturity.

      SECTION 2.4 Interest Rate Cap Agreement.

      (a) Borrower shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, and shall thereafter
maintain in effect, an Interest Rate Cap Agreement with an Acceptable
Counterparty, which shall be coterminous with the Loan, as the same may be
extended in accordance with the terms hereof and have a notional amount which
shall not at any time be less than the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
and which shall at all times have a strike rate equal to the Strike Rate. The
Counterparty shall be obligated under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement to make
monthly payments equal to the excess of one (1) month LIBOR over the Strike
Rate, calculated on the notional amount. The notional amount of the Interest
Rate Cap Agreement may be reduced from time to time in amounts equal to any
payment of the principal of the Loan in accordance with the terms hereof.

      (b) Borrower shall collaterally assign to Lender pursuant to an Assignment
of Interest Rate Cap Agreement substantially in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit A, all of its right, title and interest to receive any and all payments
under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (and any related guarantee, if any) and
shall deliver to Lender an executed counterpart of such Interest Rate Cap
Agreement and notify the Counterparty of such collateral assignment (either in
such Interest Rate Cap Agreement or by separate instrument). The Counterparty
shall agree in writing to make all payments it is required to make under the
Interest Rate Cap Agreement directly to an Account specified by Lender. At such
time as the Loan is repaid in full, all of Lender's right, title and interest in
the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall terminate and Lender shall promptly
execute and deliver at Borrower's sole cost and expense, such documents as may
be required to evidence Lender's release of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement and
to notify the Counterparty of such release.

      (c) Borrower shall comply with all of its obligations under the terms and
provisions of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement. All amounts paid by the
Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be deposited
immediately into the Lockbox Account or if the Lockbox Account is not then
required to be in effect, into such Account as specified by Lender. Borrower
shall take all actions reasonably requested by Lender to enforce Borrower's and
Lender's rights under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement in the event of a default
by the Counterparty and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify any of its
rights thereunder.

      (d) In the event of any downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
rating of the Counterparty below "AA-" (or the equivalent) by the Rating
Agencies, Borrower shall replace the Interest Rate Cap Agreement with a
Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement with an


                                      -33-
<PAGE>
Acceptable Counterparty not later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt
of notice from Lender or Servicer of such downgrade, withdrawal or
qualification.

      (e) In the event that Borrower fails to purchase and deliver to Lender the
Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Replacement Interest Cap Agreement as and
when required hereunder, Lender may purchase such Interest Rate Cap Agreement
and the cost incurred by Lender in purchasing such Interest Rate Cap Agreement
shall be paid by Borrower to Lender with interest thereon at the Default Rate
from the date such cost was incurred by Lender until such cost is paid by
Borrower to Lender.

      (f) In connection with an Interest Rate Cap Agreement, if requested by
Mortgage Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.4 of the Mortgage Loan
Agreement, Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel from counsel for the Counterparty (upon
which Lender and its successors and assigns may rely) which shall provide, in
relevant part, that:

            (1) the Counterparty is duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the
organizational power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its
obligations under, the Interest Rate Cap Agreement;

            (2) the execution and delivery of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement by
the Counterparty, and any other agreement which the Counterparty has executed
and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations
thereunder have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do
not contravene any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent Organizational Documents) or any law, regulation or contractual
restriction binding on or affecting it or its property;

            (3) all consents, authorizations and approvals required for the
execution and delivery by the Counterparty of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement,
and any other agreement which the Counterparty has executed and delivered
pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been
obtained and remain in full force and effect, all conditions thereof have been
duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with any
governmental authority or regulatory body is required for such execution,
delivery or performance; and

            (4) the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, and any other agreement which
the Counterparty has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, has been duly
executed and delivered by the Counterparty and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Counterparty, enforceable against the Counterparty in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

      SECTION 2.5 Release of Property.

      2.5.1 Release of Individual Property.

      Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, Borrower may cause Mortgage Borrower to obtain
a release from the Lien of a Security Instrument pursuant to Section 2.5.1 of
the Mortgage Loan Agreement:

      (a) Borrower shall provide Lender with at least thirty (30) days but no
more than ninety (90) days prior written notice of its request to obtain a
release of such Security Instrument;

      (b) Borrower shall have delivered evidence satisfactory to Lender that
(i)(A) Mortgage Borrower complied with all of the terms and conditions set forth
in Section 2.5.1 of the Mortgage Loan Agreement with respect to a release of the
Security Instrument thereunder and Mortgage Lender has delivered (or is
simultaneously delivering) such release to Mortgage Borrower and (ii) Junior
Mezzanine Borrower complied with all of the terms and conditions set forth in
Section 2.5.1 of the Junior Mezzanine Loan Agreement with respect to a release
(if any) of the security interest corresponding to the release requested
pursuant to this Section 2.5.1 and (B) Junior Mezzanine Lender has granted such
release to Junior Mezzanine Borrower;

      (c) Lender shall have received a wire transfer of immediately available
federal funds in an amount equal to the Release Price for the applicable
Individual Property, together with (i) all accrued and unpaid interest
calculated at the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of principal being
prepaid through and including the Prepayment Date, (ii) if such release occurs
on or prior to the Open Date, a prepayment premium equal to one percent (1%) of
the applicable Release Price, (iii) the Interest Shortfall, if applicable, with
respect to the amount prepaid, (iv) Breakage Costs, if any, without duplication
of any sums paid pursuant to the preceding clause (iii); and (v) all other sums
due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents in connection
with a partial prepayment;

      (d) Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably
requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release by Mortgage
Borrower, together with an Officer's Certificate certifying that the release
will not impair or otherwise adversely affect the Liens, security interests and
other rights of Lender under the Loan Documents not being released (or as to the
parties to the Loan Documents and Collateral);

      (e) After giving effect to such release, Lender shall have determined that
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Properties then remaining subject to the
Lien of a Security Instrument (not including the Individual Property to be
released) (but for the purpose of this calculation only, assuming a Release
Price equal to the Allocated Loan Amount) shall be at least equal to the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for all of the Properties (including the Individual
Property to be released) for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the release of the Individual Property; and

      (f) Lender shall have received payment of all Lender's reasonable costs
and expenses, including due diligence review costs and reasonable counsel fees
and disbursements


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

conditions of the Management Agreement. In no event shall the base management
fees under the Management Agreement exceed (I) with respect to the Properties

revenue and (y) two percent (2%) of total revenue; provided, however, Six
Continents Hotels shall not charge any additional franchise fees in connection
with such Properties and (II) with respect to the Properties managed by any
Person other than Six Continents Hotels, four percent (4%) of the gross income
derived from the Property (excluding any incentive management fees which are
subordinate to the Loan). Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower (or Pledgor
shall cause Operating Lessee to) (i) diligently perform and observe all of the
terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement, on the part of
Operating Lessee to be performed and observed to the end that all things shall
be done which are necessary to keep unimpaired the rights of Operating Lessee
under the Management Agreement and (ii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of
any notice by Manager to Operating Lessee of any default by Operating Lessee in
the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
the Management Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed and
observed and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such notice. Borrower shall
cause Mortgage Borrower and/or Pledgor shall cause Operating Lessee to not
surrender the Management Agreement, consent to the assignment by the Manager of
its interest under the Management Agreement, or terminate or cancel the
Management Agreement, or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the

the rights of Mortgage Lender, if Operating Lessee shall default in the
performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
Management Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed or
observed, then, without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this
Agreement, and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations
hereunder, Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to permit Lender to pay any
sums and to perform any act or take any action as may be appropriate to cause
all the terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement on the part
of Operating Lessee to be performed or observed to be promptly performed or
observed on behalf of Operating Lessee, to the end that the rights of Mortgage
Borrower in, to and under the Management Agreement shall be kept unimpaired and
free from default; provided, however, that Lender shall have no such obligation
to perform any such action. Borrower shall cause Lender and any Person
designated by Lender by written notice to Borrower to have the right to enter
upon the applicable Individual Property at any time and from time to time for
the purpose of taking any such action. If the Manager shall deliver to Lender a
copy of any notice sent to Borrower or Mortgage Borrower and/or Pledgor or
Operating Lessee of default under the Management Agreement, such notice shall
constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by Lender in good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower shall cause Mortgage
Borrower and/or Pledgor shall cause Operating Lessee to not, and shall not
permit the Manager to, sub-contract all or any material portion of its
management responsibilities under the Management Agreement to a third-party
without the prior written consent of Lender. Pledgor shall cause Operating
Lessee to request of Manager and deliver to Lender upon receipt such
certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance by Operating Lessee with the
terms of the Management Agreement as may be requested by Lender. Borrower shall
cause Mortgage Borrower and/or Pledgor shall cause Operating Lessee to exercise
each individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of the Management
Agreement to the extent required to continue it

      in full force and effect until after the Maturity Date. Any sums expended
by Lender pursuant to this paragraph (i) shall bear interest at the Default Rate
from the date such cost is incurred to the date of payment to Lender, (ii) shall
be deemed to constitute a portion of the Debt, (iii) shall be secured by the
lien of the Pledge Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (iv) shall be
immediately due and payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

      (b) Without limitation of the foregoing, Pledgor shall cause Operating
Lessee, upon the request of Lender and in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Subordination of Management Agreement, to terminate the Management
Agreement and replace the Manager, without penalty or fee, if at any time during
the Loan: (a) the Manager shall become insolvent or a debtor in any bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding, (b) there exists an Event of Default or (c) there
exists an event of default by Manager under the Management Agreement. At such
time as the Manager may be removed, provided no Event of Default has occurred, a
Qualified Manager may be selected by Mortgage Borrower and/or Operating Lessee
to assume management of the applicable Individual Property pursuant to a
Replacement Management Agreement.

      5.1.19 Environmental Covenants.

      (a) Borrower covenants and agrees that so long as the Loan is outstanding

is not in full compliance with all Environmental Laws, and share with Lender the
reports and other results thereof, and Lender and other Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to rely on such reports and other results thereof; (vii)

shall cause Mortgage Borrower to not allow any tenant or other user of any of

                                      -65-
<PAGE>
with any Environmental Laws related in any way to any of the Properties; (C) any
actual or potential Environmental Lien; (D) any required or proposed remediation
of environmental conditions relating to any of the Properties; and (E) any

      (b) Lender and any other Person designated by Lender by written notice to
Borrower, including but not limited to any representative of a Governmental

court of competent jurisdiction, shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to enter upon any Individual Property at all reasonable times to assess any and
all aspects of the environmental condition of any Individual Property and its
use, including but not limited to conducting any environmental assessment or
audit (the scope of which shall be determined in Lender's sole and absolute
discretion) and taking samples of soil, groundwater or other water, air, or
building materials, and conducting other invasive testing. Borrower shall cause
Mortgage Borrower to cooperate with and provide access to Lender and any such
Person or entity designated by Lender by written notice to Borrower.

      5.1.20 Alterations.

      Borrower shall obtain Lender's prior written consent prior to allowing
Mortgage Borrower to perform any structural or other material alterations to any
Improvements, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld except with
respect to alterations that may have a material adverse effect on Borrower's or
Mortgage Borrower's financial condition, the value of the related Individual
Property, the Collateral or the Net Operating Income thereof.

      5.1.21 Franchise Agreement.

      (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1.21(b), the Improvements on
the Properties shall be operated under the terms and conditions of the Franchise
Agreements, if applicable. Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower or Pledgor
shall cause Operating Lessee to (i) pay all sums required to be paid by
Operating Lessee under the Franchise Agreement, (ii) diligently perform, observe
and enforce all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Franchise
Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed, observed and enforced
to the end that all things shall be done which are necessary to keep unimpaired
the rights of Mortgage Borrower and/or Operating Lessee under the Franchise
Agreement, (iii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of any notice to Mortgage
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee of any default by Operating Lessee in the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the
Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed and observed
and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such notice, and (iv) promptly deliver
to Lender a copy of each financial statement, business plan, capital expenditure
plan, notice, report and estimate received by it under the Franchise Agreement.
Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1.21(b), Borrower shall cause Mortgage
Borrower and/or Pledgor shall cause Operating Lessee to not, without the prior

Franchise Agreement or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the Franchise
Agreement, in any material respect, either orally or in writing.


                                      -66-

Subject to the rights of Mortgage Lender, if Operating Lessee shall default in
the performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed or observed,
then, without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Agreement,
and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder,
Borrower shall permit Lender to pay any sums and to perform any act or take any
action as may be appropriate to cause all the terms, covenants and conditions of
the Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed or
observed to be promptly performed or observed on behalf of Operating Lessee, to
the end that the rights of Mortgage Borrower and/or Operating Lessee in, to and
under the Franchise Agreement shall be kept unimpaired and free from default;
provided, however, that Lender shall have no such obligation to perform any such
action. Borrower shall cause Lender and any Person designated by Lender by
written notice to Borrower shall have, and are hereby granted, the right to
enter upon the Properties at any time and from time to time for the purpose of
taking any such action. If Franchisor shall deliver to Lender a copy of any
notice sent to Borrower and Mortgage Borrower and/or Pledgor or Operating Lessee
of default under the Franchise Agreement, such notice shall constitute full
protection to Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Lender in
good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower and/or
Pledgor shall cause Operating Lessee, from time to time, use its best efforts to
obtain from Franchisor such certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance
by Operating Lessee with the terms of the Franchise Agreement as may be
requested by Lender. Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower and/or Pledgor shall
cause Operating Lessee to exercise each individual option, if any, to extend or
renew the term of the Franchise Agreement to the extent required to continue it
in full force and effect until after the Maturity Date. Any sums expended by
Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall bear interest at the Default Rate from
the date such cost is incurred to the date of payment to Lender, shall be deemed
to constitute a portion of the Debt, shall be secured by the lien of the Pledge
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall be immediately due and payable
upon demand by Lender therefor.

      (b) With respect to the Expiring Franchise Agreement Property only,
Borrower shall not be required to cause Mortgage Borrower to obtain Lender's
consent or a confirmation from the Rating Agencies in the event that the
Franchise Agreement in effect on the date hereof is extended on the same or more
favorable terms to Mortgage Borrower and/or Operating Lessee, as applicable,
prior to the expiration thereof.

      5.1.22 Operating Lease.

      Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to promptly notify Lender of any
event of default under the Operating Lease.

      5.1.23 OFAC.

recommendations of The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department
of the Treasury.

      5.1.24 The Ground Lease.

      With respect to each Ground Lease, Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower
to (i) pay all rents, additional rents and other sums required to be paid by
Mortgage Borrower, as tenant under and pursuant to the provisions of each Ground

conditions of each Ground Lease on the part of Mortgage Borrower, as tenant
thereunder, (iii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of any notice by the
landlord under the applicable Ground Lease to Mortgage Borrower of any default
by Mortgage Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and deliver to Lender a true copy of
each such notice within five (5) days of receipt and (iv) promptly notify Lender
of any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of the landlord under the
applicable Ground Lease or of any notice thereof, and deliver to Lender a true
copy of such notice within five (5) days of Borrower's receipt. Borrower shall
not, without the prior consent of Lender, cause Mortgage Borrower to surrender
the leasehold estate created by the applicable Ground Lease or terminate or
cancel any Ground Lease or modify, change, supplement, alter, amend or waive any
material term of any Ground Lease, either orally or in writing, and if Mortgage
Borrower shall default in the performance or observance of any term, covenant or
condition of any Ground Lease on the part of Mortgage Borrower, as tenant
thereunder, and shall fail to cure the same prior to the expiration of any
applicable cure period provided thereunder, Borrower shall cause Mortgage
Borrower to (or cause Operating Lessee to) permit Lender to, but Lender shall
not have the obligation to, pay any sums and to perform any act or take any
action as may be appropriate to cause all of the terms, covenants and conditions
of such Ground Lease on the part of Mortgage Borrower to be performed or
observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the rights of Mortgage Borrower
in, to and under such Ground Lease shall be kept unimpaired and free from
default; provided, however, that Lender shall have no such obligation to perform
any such actions. If the landlord under the applicable Ground Lease shall
deliver to Lender a copy of any notice of default under such Ground Lease, such
notice shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by Lender, in good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower
shall cause Mortgage Borrower to exercise each individual option, if any, to
extend or renew the term of each Ground Lease upon demand by Lender made at any
time within one (1) year prior to the last day upon which any such option may be
exercised.

      5.1.25 Capital Budget

its rights under the


                                      -68-
<PAGE>
Organizational Documents of Mortgage Borrower to cause Mortgage Borrower to make
to Borrower (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) a distribution in an
aggregate amount such that Lender shall receive the amount required to be
disbursed pursuant to Article III of the Mortgage Loan Agreement.

      5.1.28 Mortgage Borrower Covenants.

      Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to comply with all obligations with
which Mortgage Borrower has covenanted to comply under the Mortgage Loan
Agreement and all other Mortgage Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
those certain covenants regarding the maintenance of the Mortgage Interest Rate
Cap Agreement and affirmative and negative covenants set forth in the Mortgage
Loan Agreement) whether the Mortgage Loan has been repaid or the related
Mortgage Loan Document has been otherwise terminated, unless otherwise consented
to in writing by Lender. Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to promptly
notify Lender of all notices received by Mortgage Borrower under or in
connection with the Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, any notice by
the Mortgage Lender to Mortgage Borrower of any default by Mortgage Borrower in
the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
the Mortgage Loan Documents on the part of Mortgage Borrower to be performed or
observed, and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such notice, together with
any other consents, notices, requests or other written correspondence between
Mortgage Borrower and Mortgage Lender.

      5.1.29 Mortgage Loan Estoppels.

reasonable efforts from time to time, to obtain from the Mortgage Lender such
certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance by Mortgage Borrower with
the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents as may be reasonably requested by
Lender. In the event or to the extent that Mortgage Lender is not legally
obligated to deliver such certificates of estoppel and is unwilling to deliver
the same, or is legally obligated to deliver such certificates of estoppel but
breaches such obligation, then Borrower shall not be in breach of this provision
so long as Borrower furnishes to Lender an estoppel executed by Borrower and
Mortgage Borrower and expressly representing to Lender the information requested
by Lender regarding compliance by Mortgage Borrower with the terms of the
Mortgage Loan Documents. Borrower hereby indemnify Lender from and against all
out-of-pocket liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, assessments,
actions, or causes of action, judgments, suits, claims, demands, costs, expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and other professional
fees, whether or not suit is brought and settlement costs) and disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against Lender based in whole or in part upon any fact, event, condition, or
circumstances relating to the Mortgage Loan which was misrepresented in any
material respect in, or which warrants disclosure and was omitted from such
estoppel executed by Borrower and Mortgage Borrower.

      SECTION 5.2 Negative Covenants.

      From the date hereof until payment and performance in full of all
obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or the earlier release in full

any Person owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership
interest in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to such transfer, deliver
an updated Insolvency Opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope
and substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

be the sole general partner of FelCor Lodging Limited Partnership.

      (b) If any Distributions shall be received by Borrower or any Affiliate of
Borrower after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,

      (a) No Loan Party, Guarantor or any Affiliate of any of them or any Person
acting at any such Person's request or direction, shall acquire or agree to
acquire Mortgage Lender's interest in the Mortgage Loan, or any portion thereof
or any interest therein, or any direct or indirect ownership interest in the
holder of the Mortgage Loan, via purchase, transfer, exchange or otherwise, and
any breach or attempted breach of this provision shall constitute an Event of
Default hereunder. If, solely by operation of applicable subrogation law,
Borrower shall have failed to comply with the foregoing, then Borrower: (i)
shall immediately notify Lender of such failure; (ii) shall cause any and all
such prohibited parties acquiring any interest in the Mortgage Loan Documents:
(A) not to enforce the Mortgage Loan Documents; and (B) upon the request of
Lender, to the extent any of such prohibited parties has or have the power or
authority to do so, to promptly: (1) cancel the promissory note evidencing the
Mortgage Loan, (2) reconvey and release the Lien securing the Mortgage Loan and
any other collateral under the Mortgage Loan Documents, and (3) discontinue and
terminate any enforcement proceeding(s) under the Mortgage Loan Documents.

      (b) Lender shall have the right at any time to acquire all or any portion
of the Mortgage Loan or any interest in any holder of, or participant in, the
Mortgage Loan without notice or consent of Borrower or any other Loan Party, in
which event Lender shall have and may exercise all rights of Mortgage Lender
thereunder (to the extent of its interest), including the right (i) to declare
that the Mortgage Loan is in default in accordance with the terms thereof and
(ii) to accelerate the Mortgage Loan indebtedness, in accordance with the terms
thereof and (iii) to pursue all remedies against any obligor under the Mortgage
Loan Documents. In addition, Borrower hereby expressly agree that any claims,
counterclaims, defenses, offsets, deductions or reductions of any kind which
Mortgage Borrower or any other Person may have against Mortgage Lender relating
to or arising out of the Mortgage Loan shall be the personal obligation of
Mortgage Lender, and in no event shall Mortgage Borrower be entitled to bring,
pursue or raise any such claims, counterclaims, defenses, offsets, deductions or
reductions against Lender or any Affiliate of Lender or any other Person as the
successor holder of the Mortgage Loan or any interest therein, provided that
Mortgage Borrower may seek specific performance of its contractual rights under
the Mortgage Loan Documents.

approval to any of the following actions or items:

            (i) except as permitted by Lender herein (i) any prepayment in full

            (iv) except as permitted by the Mortgage Loan Documents, any
      determination to restore any Individual Property after a Casualty or
      Condemnation.

      (b) Prior to the payment in full of the Debt, and unless otherwise
required pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Agreement, neither Borrower nor any of
its Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of Lender (which may be
furnished or withheld at its sole and absolute discretion), give its consent or
approval to any modification or amendment in any material respect or a
consolidation, interest rate, restatement, waiver or termination of any of the
Mortgage Loan Documents.

      VI. INSURANCE; CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION; REQUIRED REPAIRS

      SECTION 6.1 Insurance.

      (a) Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to maintain at all times during
the term of the Loan the insurance required under Section 6.1 of the Mortgage
Loan Agreement, including, without limitation, meeting all insurer requirements
thereunder. In addition, Borrower shall cause Lender to be named as an
additional named insured under each of the insurance policies described in
Section 6.1(a)(ii), (iii), (v), (ix), (xi) and (xii) of the Mortgage Loan
Agreement. In addition, Borrower shall cause Lender to be named as a named
insured together with Mortgage Lender, as their interest may appear, under the

and (x) of the Mortgage Loan Agreement. Borrower shall also cause all insurance
policies required under this Section 6.1 to provide for at least thirty (30)
days prior notice to Lender in the event of policy cancellation or material
changes. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of the
Policies (as such term is defined in the Mortgage Loan Agreement) theretofore
furnished to Lender pursuant to the terms hereof, certified copies of the
Policies marked "premium paid" or accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender
of payment of the premiums due thereunder shall be delivered by Borrower to
Lender; provided, however, that in the case of renewal Policies, Borrower may
furnish Lender with binders therefor to be followed by copies of the original
Policies when issued.


                                      -76-
<PAGE>
      (b) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all
insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the
right, with prior notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Collateral, including, without
limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole
discretion deems appropriate and all expenses incurred by Lender in connection
with such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall
be paid by Borrower to Lender upon demand and until paid shall be secured by the
Pledge Agreement and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

      (c) For purposes of this Agreement, Lender shall have the same approval
rights over the insurance referred to above (including, without limitation, the
insurers, deductibles and coverages thereunder, as well as the right to require
other reasonable insurance pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(xii)) as are provided in
favor of the Mortgage Lender in the Mortgage Loan Agreement. All liability
insurance provided for in the Mortgage Loan Agreement shall provide insurance
with respect to the liabilities of both the Mortgage Borrower and the Borrower.
The insurance policies delivered pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Agreement shall
include endorsements of the type described in Section 6.1(e) thereof, but
pursuant to which Lender shall have the same rights as the Mortgage Lender as
referred to in such Section 6.1(e).

      (d) In the event that the Mortgage Loan has been paid in full, except upon
the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall permit
Mortgage Borrower to settle any insurance or condemnation claims with respect to
the insurance proceeds or condemnation awards which in the aggregate are less
than or equal to $250,000.00 for the applicable Individual Property. Lender
shall have the right to participate in and reasonably approve any settlement for
insurance or condemnation claims with respect to the insurance proceeds or
condemnation awards which in the aggregate are equal to or greater than the
$250,000 for the applicable Individual Property. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to
empower Lender, in the name of Mortgage Borrower as its true and lawful
attorney-in-fact, to file and prosecute such claim and to collect and to make
receipt for any such payment.

      (e) On the first Payment Date of each Fiscal Year, Borrower shall pay to
Lender the sum of $1,500.00 to compensate Lender for administrative costs
associated with Lender's review of Borrower's required insurance.

      SECTION 6.2 Casualty.

      If any Individual Property shall sustain a Casualty, Borrower shall cause
Mortgage Borrower to give prompt notice of such Casualty to Lender and shall
cause Mortgage Borrower to promptly commence and diligently prosecute to
completion the repair and restoration of such Individual Property as nearly as
possible to the condition such Individual Property was in immediately prior to
such Casualty and otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4 of the Mortgage Loan
Agreement.


                                      -77-
<PAGE>
      SECTION 6.3 Condemnation.

      Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to give Lender prompt notice of any
actual or threatened Condemnation by any Governmental Authority of all or any
part of any Individual Property and shall cause Mortgage Borrower to deliver to
Lender a copy of any and all papers served in connection with such proceedings.
Lender may participate in any such proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to
time cause Mortgage Borrower to deliver to Lender all instruments requested by
Lender to permit such participation. Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower, at
Borrower's expense, to diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall
consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the
carrying on or defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any
Condemnation, Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement.

      SECTION 6.4 Restoration.

      (a) Borrower shall, or shall cause Mortgage Borrower to, deliver to Lender
all reports, plans, specifications, documents and other materials that are
delivered to Mortgage Lender under Section 6.4 of the Mortgage Loan Agreement in
connection with a restoration of the Property after a Casualty or Condemnation.
If any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Awards are to be disbursed by Mortgage
Lender for restoration, Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Lender copies of all written correspondence delivered to and received from
Mortgage Lender that relates to the restoration and release of the Insurance
Proceeds or Condemnation Awards.

      (b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all
Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation Award will be made available to Mortgage
Borrower in accordance with the Mortgage Loan Agreement. In the event the
Mortgage Loan has been paid in full and Lender receives any Insurance Proceeds
or Condemnation Awards, Lender shall either apply such proceeds to the Debt or
for the restoration of the applicable Individual Property in accordance with the
same terms and conditions contained in Section 6.4 of the Mortgage Loan
Agreement.

      SECTION 6.5 Rights of Lender.

      For purposes of this Article 6, Borrower shall obtain the approval (which
approval shall be granted or withheld by Lender subject to the same standards
contained in Section 6.4 of the Mortgage Loan Agreement) of Lender for each
matter requiring the approval of Mortgage Lender under the provisions of
Sections 6.4 of the Mortgage Loan Agreement, with each reference in any such
provisions to the "Loan" to include the Mortgage Loan and the Loan, and the
reference in any such provisions to the "Maturity Date" to mean the Maturity
Date, as defined herein. If the Mortgage Lender does not require the deposit by
the Mortgage Borrower of the "Net Proceeds Deficiency" pursuant to Section
6.4(b)(vi) of the Mortgage Loan Agreement, Lender shall have the right to demand
that Borrower make a deposit of said "Net Proceeds Deficiency" in accordance
with the terms of such Section (as if each reference therein to "Borrower" and
"Lender" referred to Borrower and Lender, respectively).

      VII. RESERVE FUNDS

      SECTION 7.1 Required Repairs.

      Borrower shall, or shall cause Mortgage Borrower to, perform the Required
Repairs in accordance with all of the terms and conditions set forth in Section
7.1 of the Mortgage Loan Agreement.

      SECTION 7.2 Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.

      (a) Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of
the Taxes (the "Monthly Tax Deposit") that Lender estimates will be payable
during the next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with Lender
sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to their
respective due dates; and (b) at the option of Lender, if the liability or
casualty Policy maintained by Mortgage Borrower covering the Properties shall
not constitute an approved blanket or umbrella Policy pursuant to Section 6.1(c)
of the Mortgage Loan Agreement, or Lender shall require Borrower to cause
Mortgage Borrower to obtain a separate Policy pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the
Mortgage Loan Agreement, one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums (the "Monthly
Insurance Premium Deposit") that Lender estimates will be payable for the
renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in
order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance
Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said
amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund"). In the event Lender shall elect to collect payments in escrow for
Insurance Premiums pursuant to clause (b) above, Borrower shall pay to Lender an
initial deposit to be determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, to increase
the amounts in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to an amount which, together
with anticipated Monthly Insurance Premium Deposits, shall be sufficient to pay
all Insurance Premiums as they become due. The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and
the payments of interest or principal or both, payable pursuant to the Note and
this Agreement, shall be added together and shall be paid as an aggregate sum by
Borrower to Lender. Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to
payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower
pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof. In making any payment relating to the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or
estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or
insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the
accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax,
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount
of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and
Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future
payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. In allocating such
excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender to be the
owner of the Properties. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. If at
any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is
not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates
set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such
determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments to Lender by the
amount that Lender estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least
thirty (30) days prior to delinquency of the Taxes and/or


                                      -79-
<PAGE>
thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the Policies, as the case may be. Any
Taxes, Other Charges and Insurance Premiums paid by Lender from the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be a capital contribution from Borrower
to Mortgage Borrower.

      (b) Borrower shall be relieved of its obligation under Section 7.2(a)
above provided that Mortgage Borrower is required to and does make monthly
deposits to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund under the Mortgage Loan and Lender
receives evidence acceptable to Lender of the making of such deposits and the
payment of such Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

      SECTION 7.3 Replacements and Replacement Reserve.

      7.3.1 Replacement Reserve Fund.

      Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date, the Replacement Reserve
Monthly Deposit for Capital Expenditures required to be made to the Properties
during the calendar year as may be necessary to maintain and operate first
class, reputable hotels in the manner and quality of the hotels operated at the
Properties on the date hereof (collectively, the "Replacements"). Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "Replacement Reserve
Fund".

      7.3.2 Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account.

      (a) Lender shall make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account
to reimburse Borrower only for the costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not
be obligated to make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine maintenance (other than
Replacements) to an Individual Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed
from the Required Repair Fund.

      (b) Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of
the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2, disburse to Borrower amounts
from the Replacement Reserve Account necessary to reimburse Borrower for the
actual costs of Replacements. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse
funds from the Replacement Reserve Account if an Event of Default exists.

      (c) Each request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account
shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Lender and shall specify (i) the
specific Replacements for which the disbursement is requested, (ii) the quantity
and price of each item purchased, if the Replacement includes the purchase or
replacement of specific items, (iii) the price of all materials (grouped by type
or category) used in any Replacement other than the purchase or replacement of
specific items, and (iv) the cost of all contracted labor or other services
applicable to each Replacement for which the disbursement is requested. With
each request Borrower shall certify that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge,
all Replacements have been made in accordance with all applicable Legal
Requirements of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
applicable Individual Property to which the Replacements are being provided.
Upon request of Lender in connection with each request for disbursement in
excess of $200,000, Borrower shall provide Lender with copies of invoices for
amounts in excess of $100,000 for items or materials purchased or contracted
labor or services. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence of completion
satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable judgment.


                                      -80-
<PAGE>
      (d) Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with the Replacements
with respect to each request for disbursement prior to submitting such request
for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or, at the request of
Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower and the
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or other party to
whom payment is due in connection with a Replacement. In the case of payments
made by joint check, Lender may require a waiver of lien from each Person
receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement from the Replacement Reserve
Account. In addition, as a condition to any disbursement, Lender may require
Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each contractor, supplier, materialman,
mechanic or subcontractor who receives payment in an amount equal to or greater
than $100,000 for completion of its work or delivery of its materials. Any lien
waiver delivered hereunder shall conform to the requirements of Applicable Law
and shall cover all work performed and materials supplied (including equipment
and fixtures) for the applicable Individual Property by that contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the
current reimbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check,
the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

      (e) Borrower shall not make a request for disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account more frequently than once in any calendar month and
(except in connection with the final disbursement) the total cost of all
Replacements in any request shall not be less than $25,000.

      (f) If the Replacement Reserve Funds are disbursed to the Borrower, then
Borrower shall make a capital contribution to Mortgage Borrower in an amount
equal to such Replacement Reserve Funds disbursed to Borrower as and when such
disbursements are made pursuant to this Section 7.3.2 and Borrower shall cause
Mortgage Borrower to pay for the related Replacement.

      7.3.3 Performance of Replacements.

      (a) Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to make Replacements when
required in order to keep each Individual Property in condition and repair
consistent with other first class, full service hotels in the same market
segment and under the same franchisor in the metropolitan area in which the
respective Individual Property is located, and to keep each Individual Property
or any portion thereof from deteriorating. Borrower shall cause Mortgage
Borrower to complete all Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as soon
as practicable following the commencement of making each such Replacement.

      (b) Intentionally Omitted.

      (c) If the Mortgage Loan is paid in full and the Loan remains outstanding,
then, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in
the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that any Replacement is
not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that any Replacement
has not been completed in a workmanlike or timely manner, Lender shall have the
option, without providing any prior notice to Borrower, to withhold disbursement
for such unsatisfactory Replacement and to


                                      -81-
<PAGE>
proceed under existing contracts or, upon five (5) Business Days prior written
notice to Borrower, to contract with third parties to complete such Replacement
and to apply the Replacement Reserve Fund toward the labor and materials
necessary to complete such Replacement and to exercise any and all other
remedies available to Lender upon an Event of Default hereunder.

      (d) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making of the
Replacements pursuant to Section 7.3.3(c) above, Borrower shall cause Mortgage
Borrower to grant Lender the right, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to enter onto any Individual Property and
perform any and all work and labor necessary to complete or make the
Replacements and/or employ watchmen to protect such Individual Property from
damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Replacement
Reserve Fund, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower
and secured by the Pledge Agreement. For this purpose, Borrower shall cause
Mortgage Borrower to constitute and appoint Lender its true and lawful
attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete or undertake the
Replacements in the name of Mortgage Borrower. Such power of attorney shall be
deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower
shall cause Mortgage Borrower to empower said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i)
to use any funds in the Replacement Reserve Account for the purpose of making or
completing the Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes and
corrections to the Replacements as shall be necessary or desirable to complete
the Replacements; (iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (iv) to pay,
settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may become Liens
against any Individual Property, or as may be necessary or desirable for the
completion of the Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v) to execute all
applications and certificates in the name of Mortgage Borrower which may be
required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend all
actions or proceedings in connection with any Individual Property or the
rehabilitation and repair of any Individual Property; and (vii) to do any and
every act which Borrower might do in its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
Agreement.

      (e) Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing the Replacements; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in
addition to the Replacement Reserve Fund to make or complete any Replacement;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Replacements; or (iv) obligate Lender
to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement.

      (f) Borrower shall cause Mortgage Borrower to permit Lender and Lender's
agents and representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer,
architect, or inspector) or third parties making Replacements pursuant to this
Section 7.3.3 to enter onto each Individual Property during normal business
hours (subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the
progress of any Replacements and all materials being used in connection
therewith, to examine all plans and shop drawings relating to such Replacements
which are or may be kept at each Individual Property, and to complete any
Replacements made pursuant to this Section 7.3.3. Borrower shall cause Mortgage
Borrower to cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or
Lender's representatives or such other persons described above in connection
with inspections described in this Section 7.3.3(f) or the completion of
Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3.


                                      -82-
<PAGE>
      (g) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may require an inspection of an Individual Property at Borrower's expense
prior to making a monthly disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account,
with respect to each Individual Property, in order to verify completion of the
Replacements for which reimbursement is sought. Lender may require that such
inspection be conducted by an appropriate independent qualified professional
selected by Lender and/or may require a copy of a certificate of completion by
an independent qualified professional acceptable to Lender prior to the
disbursement of any amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower shall
pay or cause Mortgage Borrower to pay the expense of the inspection as required
hereunder, whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent
qualified professional.

      (h) The Replacements and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any other
item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be constructed, installed or
completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialmen's or
other Liens.

      (i) Before each disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account relating
to actual physical work on the Improvements in excess of $200,000 with respect
to each Individual Property, Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender with
a search of title to the applicable Individual Property effective to the date of
the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's or materialmen's Liens
or other Liens of any nature have been placed against the applicable Individual
Property since the date of recordation of the related Security Instrument and
that title to such Individual Property is free and clear of all Liens (other
than the Lien of the related Security Instrument and other Permitted
Encumbrances).

      (j) All Replacements shall comply with all applicable Legal Requirements
of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the applicable
Individual Property and applicable insurance requirements including, without
limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental
regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

      (k) If the Mortgage Loan is paid in full and the Loan remains outstanding,
in addition to any insurance required under the Loan Documents, Borrower shall
cause to be provided workmen's compensation insurance, builder's risk, and
public liability insurance and other insurance to the extent required under
Applicable Law in connection with a particular Replacement. All such policies
shall be in form and amount reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All such policies
which can be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss payable to
Lender or its assigns shall be so endorsed. Certified copies of such policies
shall be delivered to Lender.

      7.3.4 Failure to Make Replacements.

      (a) It shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement if Borrower fails
to comply with any provision of this Section 7.3 and such failure is not cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice from Lender. Upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default, Lender may use the Replacement Reserve Fund (or any portion
thereof) for any purpose, including but not limited to completion of the
Replacements as provided in Sections 7.3.3(c) and 7.3.3(d), or for any other
repair or replacement to any Individual Property or toward payment of the Debt
in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion. Lender's right to


                                      -83-
<PAGE>
withdraw and apply the Replacement Reserve Funds shall be in addition to all
other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

      (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any
portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on account of an Event of Default to
payment of the Debt or in any specific order or priority.

      7.3.5 Balance in the Replacement Reserve Account.

      The insufficiency of any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account shall
not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all preservation and
maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

      7.3.6 Waiver of Replacement Reserve.

      Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations under Sections 7.3.1, 7.3.2,
7.3.3, 7.3.4 and 7.3.5 above, provided that Mortgage Borrower is required to and
does make the monthly deposits of Replacement Reserve Funds under the Mortgage
Loan and provided Lender receives evidence acceptable to Lender of the making of
such deposits.

      SECTION 7.4 Ground Lease Escrow Fund.

      (a) In the event that the annual Ground Rent due pursuant to a Ground
Lease is in excess of $100.00, Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date
an amount (the "Monthly Ground Rent Deposit") that is estimated by Lender to be
due and payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease for all rent and any and all
other charges (the "Ground Rent") which may be due by Mortgage Borrower under
the Ground Lease in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
sums payable under the Ground Lease at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the dates due (said amounts, hereinafter called the "Ground Lease Escrow Fund").
The Ground Lease Escrow Fund is for the purpose of paying all sums due under the
Ground Lease. Upon Mortgage Borrower's failure to pay any Ground Rents pursuant
to the Ground Lease, Lender may, in its discretion, apply any amounts held in
the Ground Lease Escrow Fund to the payment of such Ground Rent; provided
however, that the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall not be deemed to create
any obligation on the part of Lender to pay any such Ground Rent from amounts on
deposit in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund. Such deposit may be increased by Lender
in the amount Lender deems is necessary in its reasonable discretion based on
any increases in the Ground Rent due under the Ground Lease.

      (b) If Ground Lease Escrow Funds are disbursed to Borrower, then Borrower
shall make a capital contribution to Mortgage Borrower in an amount equal to
such Ground Lease Escrow Funds disbursed to Borrower as and when such
disbursements are made pursuant to this Section 7.4 and Borrower shall cause
Mortgage Borrower to pay the related Ground Rent.

      (c) Borrower shall be relieved of its obligation under Section 7.4(a) and
(b) above, provided that Mortgage Borrower is required to and does make the
monthly deposits of Ground Lease Escrow Funds under the Mortgage Loan and

Default described in clauses (vi) or (vii) above) and at any time thereafter, in
addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take
such action, without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect
and enforce its rights against Borrower and the Collateral, including, without
limitation, declaring the Debt to be immediately due and payable, and Lender may
enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or remedies provided in the Loan
Documents and any or all of the Collateral and may exercise all the rights and
remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code against Borrower
and the Collateral, including, without limitation, all rights or remedies
available at law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described in
clauses (vi) or (vii) above, the Debt and all other obligations of Borrower
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and automatically
become due and payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower hereby expressly
waives any such notice or demand, anything contained herein or in any other Loan
Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

      SECTION 8.2 Remedies.

      (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of
the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and
delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised
by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the
Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to the
Collateral. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent
and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise,
at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its sole discretion,
to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, without impairing or
otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender permitted by
Applicable Law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees
that if an Event of Default is continuing all Liens and other rights, remedies
or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in


                                      -90-
<PAGE>
full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the
Collateral and the Collateral has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise
realized upon in satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

      (b) With respect to Borrower and the Collateral, nothing contained herein
or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to resort
to the Collateral for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in preference or
priority, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of the Collateral or any other
Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of the
Debt. In addition, Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially
foreclose the upon the Collateral in any manner and for any amounts secured by
the Pledge Agreement then due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole
discretion including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in
the event Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of
one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose
upon the Collateral to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event
Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance
of the Loan, Lender may foreclose upon the Collateral to recover so much of the
principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums
secured by the Pledge Agreement as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more
partial foreclosures, the Collateral shall remain subject to the Pledge
Agreement to secure payment of sums secured by the Pledge Agreement and not
previously recovered.

      (c) Lender shall have the right, from time to time, to sever the Note and
the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, pledges and other
security documents (the "Severed Loan Documents") in such denominations as
Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and
enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and
deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a
severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to
effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and
irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its
said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not
make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) days after
notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender's intent to exercise its
rights under such power. The Severed Loan Documents shall not contain any
representations, warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and
any such representations and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents
will be given by Borrower only as of the Closing Date.

      (d) Any amounts recovered from the Collateral after an Event of Default
may be applied by Lender toward the payment of any interest and/or principal of
the Loan and/or any other amounts due under the Loan Documents in such order,
priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall determine.

      SECTION 8.3 Right to Cure Defaults.

      (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, Lender may, but without any obligation to do so and without notice to
or demand on Borrower and


                                      -91-
<PAGE>
without releasing Borrower from any obligation hereunder, make any payment or do
any act required of Borrower hereunder in such manner and to such extent as
Lender may deem necessary to protect the security hereof. Lender is authorized
to enter upon the Property for such purposes, or appear in, defend, or bring any
action or proceeding to protect its interest in the Property for such purposes,
and the cost and expense thereof (including reasonable attorneys' fees to the
extent permitted by law), with interest as provided in this Section 8.3, shall
constitute a portion of the Debt and shall be due and payable to Lender upon
demand. All such costs and expenses incurred by Lender in remedying such Event
of Default or such failed payment or act or in appearing in, defending, or
bringing any action or proceeding shall bear interest at the Default Rate, for
the period after notice from Lender that such cost or expense was incurred to
the date of payment to Lender. All such costs and expenses incurred by Lender
together with interest thereon calculated at the Default Rate shall be deemed to
constitute a portion of the Debt and be secured by the liens, claims and
security interests provided to Lender under the Loan Documents and shall be
immediately due and payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

      (b) Lender shall have the right, but shall not have the obligation, to
exercise Borrower's rights under the Organizational Documents of Mortgage
Borrower (a) to cure a Mortgage Loan Event of Default and (b) to satisfy any
Liens, claims or judgments against the Properties (except for Liens permitted by
the Mortgage Loan Documents), in the case of either (a) or (b), unless Borrower
or Mortgage Borrower shall be diligently pursuing remedies to cure to Lender's
sole satisfaction. Borrower shall reimburse Lender on demand for any and all
costs incurred by Lender in connection with curing any such Mortgage Loan Event
of Default or satisfying any Liens, claims or judgments against any Individual
Property.

      SECTION 8.4 Remedies Cumulative; Waivers.

      The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's rights, powers
and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time
and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay
or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one or more
Defaults or Events of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to
be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to
impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

      SECTION 8.5 Power of Attorney.

      For the purpose of carrying out the provisions and exercising the rights,
powers and privileges granted in this Section 8, Borrower hereby irrevocably
appoints the Lender as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact to execute,
acknowledge and deliver any instruments and do and perform any acts such as are
referred to in this subsection in the name and on behalf of Borrower. This power
of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.

      (e) make such representations and warranties as of the closing date of the
Lender Transaction with respect to the Collateral, the Properties, Borrower,
Mortgage Borrower and the Loan Documents as are customarily provided in
securitization transactions and as may be reasonably requested by the holder of
the Note or the Rating Agencies and consistent with the facts covered by such
representations and warranties as they exist on the date thereof, including the
representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents

      Other than costs and expenses which are otherwise the responsible of
Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, in connection with
Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 9.1, Borrower shall
only be responsible for the payment of (i) Borrower's legal counsel and
accountants and (ii) any internal, administrative or clerical cost and expenses
incurred by Borrower.

      SECTION 9.2 Securitization.

      In the event Lender ever desires to issue mortgage pass-through
certificates or other securities evidencing a beneficial interest in a rated or
unrated public offering or private placement, Borrower agrees to (and agrees to
cause Mortgage Borrower to) cooperate with Lender to the same extent such
cooperation is required of Mortgage Borrower pursuant to the terms of the
Mortgage Loan Agreement.

      SECTION 9.3 Servicer.

      At the option of Lender or Agent, the Loan may be serviced by a
servicer/trustee (the "Servicer") selected by Lender or Agent and Lender or
Agent may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the Servicer pursuant to a servicing
agreement (the "Servicing Agreement") between Lender or Agent and Servicer.

      SECTION 9.4 Exculpation.

      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.4 and comparable
provisions in the Pledge Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, Lender shall
not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the
obligations contained in this Agreement, the Note or the Pledge Agreement by any
action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower
or any of Borrower's Affiliates, except that Lender may bring a foreclosure
action, action for specific performance or other appropriate action or
proceeding to enable Lender to enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the
Note, the Pledge Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Collateral, and
any other Collateral created by this Agreement, the Note, the Pledge Agreement
and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that any judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of
Borrower's interest in the Collateral and in any other collateral given to
Lender. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the Note and the Pledge Agreement,
agrees that it shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.4 and
comparable provisions or in the Pledge Agreement, sue for, seek or demand any
deficiency judgment against Borrower or any of Borrower's Affiliates in any such
action or proceeding, under or by reason of or under or in connection with this
Agreement, the Note, the Pledge Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The
provisions of this Section shall not, however, (i) constitute a waiver, release
or impairment


                                      -94-
<PAGE>
of any obligation evidenced or secured by this Agreement, the Note, the Pledge

Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a
receiver; (v) impair the right of Lender to enforce Sections 4.1.9, 4.1.29,
5.1.9 and 5.2.8 hereof; or (vi) impair the right of Lender to obtain a
deficiency judgment or other judgment on the Note against Borrower to the extent
necessary to (A) preserve or enforce its rights and remedies against the
Collateral or (B) obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to which Lender would
otherwise be entitled under the terms of this Agreement or the Pledge Agreement;
provided however, Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the extent of
amounts Lender is entitled to under the terms of this Agreement from such
Insurance Proceeds and/or Awards.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.4 to the contrary,
Borrower shall be personally liable to Lender for the Losses Lender incurs to
the extent due to: (i) fraud or material misrepresentation in connection with
the execution and the delivery of this Agreement, the Note, the Pledge
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any Mortgage Loan Document; (ii)

distribution to its equity owners after the occurrence of an Event of Default;
(vii) Mortgage Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges (except to the
extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have been deposited in escrow
with Mortgage Lender pursuant to the terms of Section 7.2 of the Mortgage Loan
Agreement), charges for labor or materials or other charges that can create
Liens on the Properties; (viii) Borrower's or Pledgor's failure to return or to
reimburse Lender for all Personal Property taken from any Properties by or on
behalf of Mortgage Borrower or Operating Lessee and not replaced with Personal
Property of comparable utility and value; (ix) any act of intentional waste or
arson to the Collateral by Borrower, Mortgage Borrower, the Operating Lessee SPE
Entities, the Pledgor SPE Entities or Principal or any Affiliate or thereof or
by any Indemnitor or Guarantor; (x) any fees or commissions paid by Borrower to
Principal, Mortgage Borrower, the Pledgor SPE Entities, the Operating Lessee SPE

terms of this Agreement, the Note, the Pledge Agreement or the other Loan
Documents; (xi) Borrower's failure to comply with the provisions of Sections
4.1.40 and 5.1.19 of this Agreement. (xii) any Loss resulting from a Casualty

                                      -95-
<PAGE>
written notice to Borrower); (xiv) if any Ground Lease is modified or terminated

without limitation, any termination or similar fees by, or on behalf of,
Operating Lessee) resulting from a termination of the franchise license
agreement(s) relating to the Hilton Franchised Properties.

      (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to pursue
recourse liability as set forth in Subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL AND
VOID and shall be of no further force and effect and the obligation to repay the
Debt shall become a personal recourse obligation of Borrower (i) in the event of
Borrower's or Principal's default under Section 4.1.36 hereof or Pledgor's
default under Section 12 of the Operating Lease Subordination Agreement (such
that such failure was considered by a court as a factor in the court's finding
for a consolidation of the assets of Borrower, Principal and/or Pledgor with the
assets of another Person) or any Transfer in violation of the provisions of
Section 5.2.10 hereof, (ii) if any Individual Property, the Collateral, or any
part thereof shall become an asset, or if Borrower, Principal, Ground Lessor, an
Operating Lessee SPE Entity, a Pledgor SPE Entity, Mortgage Borrower, Mortgage
Principal, Junior Mezzanine Borrower or Junior Mezzanine Principal shall be a
debtor, in (A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or (B) an
involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding commenced by any Person (other
than Lender, Mortgage Lender or Junior Mezzanine Lender) and, with respect to
such involuntary proceeding, Borrower consents or fails to object to such
proceedings) or if Borrower, Principal, Ground Lessor, an Operating Lessee SPE
Entity, a Pledgor SPE Entity, Mortgage Borrower, Mortgage Principal, Junior
Mezzanine Borrower, Junior Mezzanine Principal or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing has acted in concert with, colluded or conspired with the party to
cause the filing of such involuntary proceeding, (iii) the event that fee title
to any applicable Individual Property is not promptly transferred by Ground
Lessor to Mortgage Borrower in accordance with the terms of the option to
purchase such fee title contained in each Ground Lease or (iv) an Event of
Default contemplated by Section 8.1(xi)(b), 8.1(xi)(c) or 8.1(xxiv)(b) hereof
has occurred (unless caused by, or at the request of, Lender, Mortgage Lender of
Junior Mezzanine Lender); provided, however, with respect to this Section
9.4(c)(iii) and (iv) only, Borrower shall only be liable on a recourse basis for
the Allocated Loan Amounts (plus interest thereon and costs and expenses
relating thereto) of the Individual Properties that were the cause of such Event
of Default.

      (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which
Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of
the Bankruptcy Code against Borrower and Principal to file a claim for the full
amount of the indebtedness secured by the Pledge Agreement or to require that
all Collateral shall continue to secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender
in accordance with this Agreement, the Note, the Pledge Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

      SECTION 9.5 Mortgage Loan Defaults.

      (a) Without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this
Agreement, and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations
hereunder, if there shall occur any Default under the Mortgage Loan Documents or
if Mortgage Lender asserts in writing that Mortgage Borrower has defaulted in
the performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition of the Mortgage
Loan Documents (whether or not the same shall have continued beyond any
applicable notice or grace periods, whether or not Mortgage Lender shall have
delivered proper notice to Mortgage Borrower, and without regard to any other
defenses or offset rights Mortgage Borrower may have against Mortgage Lender),
Borrower hereby expressly agrees that Lender shall have the immediate right,
without notice to or demand on Borrower or Mortgage Borrower, but shall be under
no obligation: (i) to pay all or any part of the Mortgage Loan, and any other
sums, that are then due and payable and to perform any act or take any action on
behalf of Mortgage Borrower, as may be appropriate, to cause all of the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Mortgage Loan Documents on the part of Mortgage
Borrower to be performed or observed thereunder to be promptly performed or
observed; and (ii) to pay any other amounts and take any other action as Lender,
in its sole and absolute discretion, shall deem advisable to protect or preserve
the rights and interests of Lender in the Loan and/or the Collateral. Lender
shall have no obligation to complete any cure or attempted cure undertaken or
commenced by Lender. All sums so paid and the costs and expenses incurred by
Lender in exercising rights under this Section (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' and other professional fees), with interest at the Default
Rate, for the period from the date of demand by Lender to Borrower for such
payments to the date of payment to Lender, shall constitute a portion of the
Debt, shall be secured by the Pledge Agreement and shall be due and payable to
Lender within two (2) Business Days following demand therefor. In the event that
Lender makes any payment in respect of the Mortgage Loan, Lender shall be
subrogated to all of the rights of Mortgage Lender under the Mortgage Loan
Documents against the Property and Mortgage Borrower in addition to all other
rights Lender may have under the Loan Documents or applicable law.

      (b) Subject to the rights of tenants, Borrower hereby grants, and shall
cause Mortgage Borrower to grant, Lender and any Person designated by Lender the
right to enter upon the Property at any time for the purpose of carrying out the
rights granted to Lender under this Section 9.5. Borrower shall not, and shall
not cause or permit Mortgage Borrower or any other Person to impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay, any effort or action on the part of Lender to cure any
default or asserted default under the Mortgage Loan, or to otherwise protect or
preserve Lender's interests in the Loan and the Collateral, including the
Property in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

      (c) Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender from and against all out-of-pocket
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, assessments, actions, or
causes of action, judgments, suits, claims, demands, costs, expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and other professional fees, whether
or not suit is brought, and settlement costs), and disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
Lender as a result of the foregoing actions described in Section 9.10(a). Lender
shall have no obligation to Borrower, Mortgage Borrower or any other party to
make any such payment or performance.


                                      -97-
<PAGE>
      (d) If Lender shall receive a copy of any notice of default under the
Mortgage Loan Documents sent by Mortgage Lender to Mortgage Borrower, such
notice shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by Lender, in good faith, in reliance thereon. As a material
inducement to Lender's making the Loan, Borrower hereby absolutely and
unconditionally release and waive all claims against Lender arising out of
Lender's exercise of its rights and remedies provided in this Section other than
claims arising out of the fraud, illegal acts, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Lender.

      (e) Any Default under the Mortgage Loan which is cured by Lender, whether
or not such cure is prior to the expiration of any applicable grace, notice or
cure period under the Mortgage Loan Documents, shall constitute an immediate
Event of Default under this Agreement without any notice, grace or cure period
otherwise applicable under this Agreement.

      SECTION 9.6 Intercreditor Agreement.

      (a) Lender and Mortgage Lender are parties to a certain intercreditor
agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Intercreditor Agreement")
memorializing their relative rights and obligations with respect to the Mortgage
Loan, the Loan, Mortgage Borrower, Borrower and the Properties. Borrower and
Mortgage Borrower hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) such Intercreditor
Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of Lender and Mortgage Lender and
(ii) Borrower and Mortgagor are not intended third-party beneficiaries of any of
the provisions therein and shall not be entitled to rely on any of the
provisions contained therein. Lender and Mortgage Lender have not disclosed and
shall have no obligation to disclose to Borrower the contents of the
Intercreditor Agreement. Borrower's obligations hereunder are independent of
such Intercreditor Agreement and remain unmodified by the terms and provisions
thereof.

      (b) In the event Lender is required pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement to pay over any payment or distribution of assets,
whether in cash, property or securities which is applied to the Debt, including,
without limitation, any proceeds of the Properties previously received by Lender
on account of the Loan to the Mortgage Lender, then Borrower agrees to indemnify
Lender for any amounts so paid, and any amount so paid shall continue to be
owing pursuant to the Loan Documents as part of the Debt notwithstanding the
prior receipt of such payment by Lender.

      SECTION 9.7 Discussions with Mortgage Lender.

      In connection with the exercise of its rights set forth in the Loan
Documents, Lender shall have the right at any time to discuss the Properties,
the Mortgage Loan, the Loan or any other matter directly with Mortgage Lender or
Mortgage Lender's consultants, agents or representatives without notice to or
permission from Borrower or any other Loan Party, nor shall Lender have any
obligation to disclose such discussions or the contents thereof with Borrower or
any other Loan Party.

      SECTION 9.8 Independent Approval Rights.

      If any action, proposed action or other decision is consented to or
approved by Mortgage Lender, such consent or approval shall not be binding or
controlling on Lender. Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
risks of Mortgage Lender in making the Mortgage


                                      -98-
<PAGE>
Loan are different from the risks of Lender in making the Loan, (ii) in
determining whether to grant, deny, withhold or condition any requested consent
or approval Mortgage Lender and Lender may reasonably reach different
conclusions, and (iii) Lender has an absolute independent right to grant, deny,
withhold or condition any requested consent or approval based on its own point
of view. Further, the denial by Lender of a requested consent or approval shall
not create any liability or other obligation of Lender if the denial of such
consent or approval results directly or indirectly in a default under the
Mortgage Loan, and Borrower hereby waives any claim of liability against Lender
arising from any such denial.

      SECTION 9.9 Reinstatement.

      This Agreement and each other Loan Document shall continue to be effective
or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of
the Debt or any part thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or
reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by Borrower,
whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent conveyance," or otherwise, all
as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any
payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the
Debt shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so
rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

      X. MISCELLANEOUS

      SECTION 10.1 Survival.

      This Agreement and all covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made herein and in the certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the making by Lender of the Loan and the execution and delivery to
Lender of the Note, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as all
or any of the Debt is outstanding and unpaid unless a longer period is expressly
set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include
the legal representatives, successors and assigns of such party. All covenants,
promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall
inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of
Lender, and all covenants, promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on
behalf of Lender, shall be binding upon the legal representatives successors and
assigns of Lender.

      SECTION 10.2 Lender's Discretion.

      Whenever pursuant to this Agreement, Lender exercises any right given to
it to approve or disapprove, or any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory to
Lender, the decision of Lender to approve or disapprove or to decide whether
arrangements or terms are satisfactory or not satisfactory shall (except as is
otherwise specifically herein provided) be in the sole discretion of Lender and
shall be final and conclusive.

      SECTION 10.3 Governing Law.

      (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT ENTERED INTO PURSUANT
TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND


                                      -99-
<PAGE>
SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED, CONSTRUED, APPLIED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (OTHER THAN THOSE CONFLICT OF LAW
PROVISIONS THAT WOULD DEFER TO THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION).
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE PRECEDING CHOICE OF LAW, THE PARTIES ELECT TO BE
GOVERNED BY NEW YORK LAW IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ARE RELYING (AT LEAST IN PART)
ON, SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

      (b) WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR ACTION ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT, THE NOTE, OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, BORROWER (A) IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN NEW
YORK, NEW YORK, AND APPELLATE COURTS FROM ANY THEREOF, AND (B) IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE AT ANY TIME TO THE LAYING ON VENUE OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
NOTE OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT, IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS
BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTE OR
THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO PRECLUDE LENDER FROM
BRINGING AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT HERETO IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE PRECEDING CONSENTS TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE,
THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH NEW YORK COURTS IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 5-1402 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF

      SECTION 10.4 Modification, Waiver in Writing.

      No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement, the Note, or of any other Loan Document, nor
consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

      SECTION 10.5 Delay Not a Waiver.

      Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender or Borrower in
insisting upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement,
or exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note

therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor


                                     -100-
<PAGE>
shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise,
or the exercise of any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular,
and not by way of limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any
amount payable under this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender
shall not be deemed to have waived any right either to require prompt payment
when due of all other amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other
Loan Documents, or to declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of
any such other amount.

proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared


                                     -102-
<PAGE>
to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a
trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, State or federal
law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or
proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or part thereof intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such
payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender.

      SECTION 10.11 Waiver of Notice.

      Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

      SECTION 10.12 Remedies of Borrower.

      In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment.

      SECTION 10.13 Expenses; Indemnity.

      (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Borrower covenants and
agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to reimburse, Lender within five (5)
days of receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
Lender in connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of furnishing
all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without limitation any opinions
requested by Lender as to any legal matters arising under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents with respect to the Properties); (ii) Borrower's ongoing
performance of and compliance with Borrower's respective agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part
to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, confirming compliance with environmental and insurance requirements;
(iii) Lender's ongoing performance and compliance with all agreements and
conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part
to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any consents, amendments,
waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and any other documents or matters requested by


                                     -103-
<PAGE>
Lender; (v) securing Borrower's compliance with any requests made pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement; (vi) the filing and recording fees and
expenses, UCC insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
providing to Lender all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses
incurred in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor of Lender pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing or preserving any
rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any
action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case against, under or
affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Collateral, or
any other security given for the Loan; and (viii) enforcing any obligations of
or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or with respect to the Collateral or in connection with any
refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the
payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of
the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender. Any
cost and expenses due and payable to Lender may, at Lender's option, be payable
to Lender's designee.

      (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for Lender in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not
Lender shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against Lender in any manner relating to or arising out of (i)
any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however, that Borrower
shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such
Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable
because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum
portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under Applicable Law to the
payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Lender.

      (c) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless Lender and the Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA, the Code, any State statute or other similar law that may be required, in
Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur, directly or indirectly, as a
result of a default under Sections 4.1.9 or 5.2.8 hereof.

      SECTION 10.14 Schedules and Exhibits Incorporated.

      The Schedules and Exhibits annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein
as a part of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body
hereof.


                                     -104-
<PAGE>
      SECTION 10.15 Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses.

      Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and
the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to the Loan Documents which
Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of the Loan Documents, and no
such unrelated counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by
Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such
documents and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset,
counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly
waived by Borrower.

      SECTION 10.16 No Joint Venture or Partnership; No Third Party
Beneficiaries.

      (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender and
Lender does not have any fiduciary relationship to Borrower. Nothing herein or
therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common,
or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender.

      (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit
of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower
(or an Affiliate of either of the foregoing acting on behalf of Borrower or
Lender, as applicable) any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or
observance of any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions
to the obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

      SECTION 10.17 Publicity.

      All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or their
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents, to
Lender, or any of their Affiliates shall be subject to the prior written
approval of Lender, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, disclosure required by any federal or State securities laws,
rules or regulations, as determined by Borrower's counsel, shall not be subject
to the prior written approval of Lender.

      SECTION 10.18 Cross-Default; Cross-Collateralization; Waiver of
Marshalling of Assets.

      (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower upon
the security of its collective interest in the Collateral and in reliance upon
the aggregate of the Collateral being of greater value as collateral security
than the sum of any portion of the Collateral taken separately. Borrower agrees
that the Pledge Agreements are and will be cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event of Default under any of the
Pledge Agreements shall constitute an Event of Default under each of the other
Pledge


                                     -105-
<PAGE>
Agreements which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of Default under the Note or
this Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default under each Pledge Agreement;
(iii) each Pledge Agreement shall constitute security for the Note as if a
single blanket lien were placed on all of the Properties as security for the
Note; and (iv) such cross-collateralization shall in no event be deemed to
constitute a fraudulent conveyance.

      (b) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower, for
itself and its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the
assets of Borrower, Junior Mezzanine Borrower, and of the Collateral, or to a
sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of all or any of
the Pledge Agreement, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws
pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of
alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or
any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender
under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Collateral for the collection of the
Debt without any prior or different resort for collection or of the right of
Lender to the payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Properties in
preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, Borrower, for itself
and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of the Pledge
Agreement, any equitable right otherwise available to Borrower which would
require the separate sale of the Collateral or require Lender to exhaust its
remedies against any portion of the Collateral before proceeding against any
other portion of the Collateral; and further in the event of such foreclosure
Borrower does hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of
Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any
combination of the Collateral.

      SECTION 10.19 Waiver of Counterclaim.

      Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

      SECTION 10.20 Conflict; Construction of Documents; Reliance.

      In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and
any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.
The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent counsel
in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan Documents
and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing
their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that,
with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and
advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any
statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any parent,
subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any limitation
whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any
of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which govern the
Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of
Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower
hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on
the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of any such rights
or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real
estate financings and other real estate transactions and investments which may
be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business of Borrower or its
Affiliates.

      SECTION 10.21 Brokers and Financial Advisors.

      Borrower and Lender hereby represent that they have dealt with no
financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind (including Lender's
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in any way relating to or arising from
a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of Borrower in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein. The provisions of this Section 10.21
shall survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and the payment
of the Debt.

      SECTION 10.22 Prior Agreements.

      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire agreement
of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such parties,
whether oral or written, between Borrower and/or its Affiliates and Lender are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      SECTION 10.23 Certain Additional Rights of Lender.

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which may be contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of Section 9.4 hereof,
Lender shall have:

      (a) the right to routinely consult with and advise Borrower's management
regarding the significant business activities and business and financial
developments of Borrower, provided, however, that such consultations shall not
include discussions of environmental compliance programs or disposal of
hazardous substances. Consultation meetings should occur, at Lender's request,
on a regular basis at any reasonable times;

      (b) the right, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to examine
the books and records of Borrower at any time upon reasonable notice;

      (c) the right, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to receive
monthly, quarterly and year-end financial reports, including balance sheets,
statements of income, shareholder's equity and cash flow, a management report
and schedules of outstanding indebtedness;

      (d) the right, without restricting any other rights of Lender under this
Agreement (including any similar right), to approve any acquisition by Borrower
of any other significant property (other than personal property required for the
day to day operation of the Properties);

      (e) the right, without restricting any other rights of Lender under this
Agreement (including any similar right), in the event of certain Events of
Default, to vote the owners' interests in Borrower pursuant to irrevocable
proxies granted, at the request of Borrower in advance for this purpose; and


                                     -107-
<PAGE>
      (f) the right, without restricting any other rights of Lender under this
Agreement (including any similar right), to restrict the transfer to voting
interests in Borrower held by its members, an the right to restrict the transfer
of interests in such member, except for any Transfer that is a permitted
transfer.

            After prior written notice to Borrower, the rights described above
may be exercised by any entity which owns and controls, directly or indirectly,
substantially all of the interests in Lender.

      SECTION 10.24 Counterparts.

      This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this
Agreement on any number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts
taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
