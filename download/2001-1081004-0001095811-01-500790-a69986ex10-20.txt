                                  NOVATION, LLC

                           PHARMACY SUPPLIER AGREEMENT

1. INTRODUCTION.

        a. PURCHASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS. Novation, LLC ("Novation") is
engaged in providing purchasing opportunities with respect to high quality
products and services to participating health care providers ("Members").
Members are entitled to participate in Novation's programs through their
membership or other participatory status in any of the following client
organizations: VHA Inc., University HealthSystem Consortium, and HealthCare
Purchasing Partners International, LLC (collectively, "Clients"). Novation is
acting as the exclusive agent for each of the Clients and certain of each
Client's subsidiaries and affiliates, respectively (and not collectively), with
respect to this Agreement. A current listing of Members is maintained by
Novation in the electronic database described in the Guidebook referred to in
Subsection 7.c below ("Novation Database"). A provider will become a "Member"
for purposes of this Agreement at the time Novation adds the provider to the
Novation Database and will cease to be a "Member" for such purposes at the time
Novation deletes the provider from the Novation Database.

        b. AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS. Novation and/or the Clients have entered
into arrangements with certain distributors ("Authorized Distributors") that
have agreed to distribute the Products to Members. A current listing of
Authorized Distributors is maintained by Novation in the Novation Database. A
distributor will become an "Authorized Distributor" for purposes of this
Agreement at the time Novation adds the distributor to the Novation Database and
will cease to be an "Authorized Distributor" for such purposes at the time
Novation deletes the distributor from the Novation Database. Any limitations on
the scope of an Authorized Distributor's authority will also be set forth in the
Novation Database. By reason of requirements of law, regulation or internal
policy of certain Members, from time to time Novation may identify underutilized
businesses as Authorized Distributors.

        c. SUPPLIER. Supplier is the manufacturer of products listed on Exhibit
A, the provider of installation, training and maintenance services for such
products, and the provider of any other services listed on Exhibit A (such
products and/or services are collectively referred to herein as "Products").

        d. CONTRACT PRICES; NON-PRICE SPECIFICATIONS; COMMITTED PROGRAMS. A
description of the Products and pricing therefor ("Contract Prices") is attached
hereto as Exhibit A, the other specifications are attached hereto as Exhibit B
("Non-Price Specifications"), and the Special Conditions are attached hereto as
Exhibit C ("Special Conditions").

2. BASIC TERMS.

        a. PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS. Novation and Supplier hereby agree that
Supplier will make the Products available for purchase by the Authorized
Distributors at the Contract Prices for resale to the Members in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; provided, however. that this Agreement will not
constitute a commitment by any person to purchase any of the Products.

        b. QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. Supplier must complete and submit the
Novation QA/RA questionnaire for evaluation by Novation's Supplier Certification
Committee (the "Committee"). The completed questionnaire addresses the
Supplier's quality standards, procedures, personnel, regulatory history, FDA
inspections and responses, back order history, frequency of product recalls, as
well as contract manufacturers, sub-contractors or re-packagers (if any) as
submitted on the QA/RA questionnaire, unless prior written consent is obtained
from Novation. Failure to use the contract manufacturers, sub-contractors or
re-packagers (if any) listed on the QA/RA questionnaire, shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement, giving Novation a right to terminate this Agreement
and subjecting Supplier to potential liability to Novation, the Clients, the
Members, and the Authorized Distributors, including without limitation,
liability for costs of replacement products and loss of Marketing Fees from such
breach.

Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Effective Date, Supplier must be
certified as "Approved" or "Conditionally Approved" by the Committee. In certain
instances where the Supplier does not receive the approval of the Committee, the
Committee may wish to monitor the Supplier's quality performance and may
classify the Supplier as "Conditionally Approved." During the "Conditionally
Approved" time period, the Supplier must provide quarterly reports listing any
FDA inspections received during the quarter, FD-483 observations and warning
letters issued, as well as all responses thereto. If no FDA inspections occur,
or inspections occur in which there are no observations or warning letters, the
"Conditionally Approved" Supplier must so indicate in the quarterly reports.
After the 180 day grace period, failure by the Supplier to be deemed "Approved"
or "Conditionally Approved" by the Committee shall constitute a breach of this
Agreement, giving Novation the right to terminate this Agreement and subjecting
Supplier to potential liability to Novation, the Clients, the Members, and the
Authorized Distributors, including without limitation, liability for costs of
replacement products and loss of Marketing Fees resulting from such breach.

        c. OPTIONAL PURCHASING ARRANGEMENT. Novation and Supplier agree that
each Member will have the option of purchasing the Products under the terms of
this Agreement or under the terms of any other purchasing or pricing arrangement
that may exist between such Member and Supplier at any time during the Term;
provided, however, that, regardless of the arrangement, Supplier will comply
with Sections 7 and 9 below. If any Member uses any other purchasing or pricing
arrangement with Supplier when ordering products covered by any contract between
Supplier and Novation, Supplier will notify such Member of the pricing and other
significant terms of the applicable Novation contract.



                                      -2-
<PAGE>   7

        d. MARKET COMPETITIVE TERMS. Supplier agrees that the prices, quality,
value and technology of all Products purchased under this Agreement will remain
market competitive at all times during the Term. Supplier agrees to provide
prompt written notice to Novation of all offers for the sale of the Products
made by Supplier during the Term on terms that are more favorable to the offeree
than the terms of this Agreement. Supplier will lower the Contract Prices or
increase any discount applicable to the purchase of the Products as necessary to
assure market competitiveness. If at any time during the Term Novation receives
information from any source suggesting that Supplier's prices, quality, value or
technology are not market competitive, Novation may provide written notice of
such information to Supplier, and Supplier will, within five (5) business days
for Novation's private label Products and within ten (10) business days for all
other Products, advise Novation in writing of and fully implement all
adjustments necessary to assure market competitiveness.

        e. CHANGES IN CONTRACT PRICES. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in any
exhibit to this Agreement, the Contract Prices will not be increased and any
discount will not be eliminated or reduced during the Term. In addition to any
changes made to assure market competitiveness, Supplier may lower the Contract
Prices or increase any discount applicable to the purchase of the Products at
any time.

        f. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES IN PRICING TERMS. Supplier will provide not
less than sixty (60) days' prior written notice to Novation and not less than
forty-five (45) days' prior written notice to all Authorized Distributors of any
change in pricing terms permitted or required by this Agreement. For purposes of
the foregoing notification requirements, a change in pricing terms will mean any
change that affects the delivered price to the Member, including, without
limitation, changes in list prices, discounts or pricing tiers or schedules.
Such prior written notice will be provided in such format and in such detail as
may be required by Novation from time to time, and will include, at a minimum,
sufficient information to determine line item pricing of the Products for all
affected Members.

        g. UNDERUTILIZED BUSINESSES. Certain Members may be required by law,
regulation and/or internal policy to do business with underutilized businesses
such as Minority Business Enterprises (MBE), Disadvantaged Business Enterprises
(DBE), Small Business Enterprises (SBE), Historically Underutilized Businesses
(HUB) and/or Women-owned Business Enterprises (WBE). To assist Novation in
helping Members meet these requirements, Supplier will comply with all Novation
policies and programs with respect to such businesses and will provide, on
request, Novation or any Member with statistical or other information with
respect to Supplier's utilization of such businesses as a vendor, distributor,
contractor or subcontractor.

3. TERM AND TERMINATION.

        a. TERM. This Agreement will be effective as of the effective date set
forth in Exhibit D attached hereto ("Effective Date"), and, unless sooner
terminated, will continue in full force and effect for the initial term set
forth in the Non-Price Specifications and for any renewal terms set forth in the
Non-Price Specifications by Novation's delivery of written notice of renewal to
Supplier not less than ten (10) days prior to the end of the initial term or any
renewal



                                      -3-
<PAGE>   8

term, as applicable. The initial term, together with the renewal terms, if any,
are collectively referred to herein as the "Term."

        b. TERMINATION BY NOVATION. Novation may terminate this Agreement at any
time for any reason whatsoever by delivering not less than sixty (60) days'
prior written notice thereof to Supplier. In addition, Novation may terminate
this Agreement immediately by delivering written notice thereof to Supplier upon
the occurrence of either of the following events:

                (1) Supplier breaches this Agreement; or

                (2) Supplier becomes bankrupt or insolvent or makes an
        unauthorized assignment or goes into liquidation or proceedings are
        initiated for the purpose of having a receiving order or winding up
        order made against Supplier, or Supplier applies to the courts for
        protection from its creditors.

Novation's right to terminate this Agreement due to Supplier's breach in
accordance with this Subsection is in addition to any other rights and remedies
Novation, the Clients, the Members or the Authorized Distributors may have
resulting from such breach, including, but not limited to, Novation's and the
Clients' right to recover all loss of Marketing Fees resulting from such breach
through the date of termination and for sixty (60) days thereafter.

        c. TERMINATION BY SUPPLIER. Supplier may terminate this Agreement at any
time for any reason whatsoever by delivering not less than sixty (60) days'
prior written notice thereof to Novation.

4. PRODUCT SUPPLY.

        a. DELIVERY AND INVOICING. On and after the Effective Date, Supplier
agrees to deliver Products ordered directly by the Members to the Members and
Products ordered by the Authorized Distributors on behalf of Members to the
Authorized Distributors, FOB destination, and will direct its invoices to the
ordering organization in accordance with this Agreement. Supplier agrees to
prepay and absorb charges, if any, for transporting Products directly to the
Members or to the Authorized Distributors. Payment terms through Authorized
Distributors are 2%-30, Net 31 days. Supplier will make whatever arrangements
are reasonably necessary with the Members ordering directly and with the
Authorized Distributors to implement the terms of this Agreement; provided,
however, Supplier will not impose any purchasing commitment on any Member or
Authorized Distributor as a condition to the Member's or Authorized
Distributor's purchase of any Products pursuant to this Agreement.



                                      -4-
<PAGE>   9

        b. PRODUCT FILL RATES; CONFIRMATION AND DELIVERY TIMES. Supplier agrees
to provide product fill rates to the Members and Authorized Distributors of
greater than ninety-five percent (95%), calculated as line item orders. Supplier
will provide confirmation of orders from the Members or Authorized Distributors
via the electronic data interchange described in the Guidebook referred to in
Subsection 7.e below within two (2) business days after placement of the order
and will deliver the Products to the Members ordering directly within five (5)
business days and to Authorized Distributors within ten (10) business days after
placement of the order.

        c. BUNDLED TERMS. Supplier agrees to give Novation prior written notice
of any offer Supplier makes to any Member or Authorized Distributor to sell
products that are not covered by this Agreement in conjunction with Products
covered by this Agreement under circumstances where the Member or Authorized
Distributor has no real economic choice other than to accept such bundled terms.

        d. DISCONTINUATION OF PRODUCTS; CHANGES IN PACKAGING. Supplier will have
no unilateral right to discontinue any of the Products or to make any changes in
packaging which render any of the Products substantially different in use,
function or distribution. Supplier may request Novation in writing to agree to a
proposed discontinuation of any Products or a proposed change in packaging for
any Products at least ninety (90) days prior to the proposed implementation of
the discontinuation or change. Under no circumstances will any Product
discontinuation or packaging changes be permitted under this Agreement without
Novation's agreement to the discontinuation or change. In the event Supplier
implements such proposed discontinuation or change without Novation's agreement
thereto in writing, in addition to any other rights and remedies Novation or the
Members may have by reason of such discontinuation or change, (i) Novation will
have the right to terminate any or all of the Product(s) subject to such
discontinuation or change or to terminate this Agreement in its entirety
immediately upon becoming aware of the discontinuation or change or any time
thereafter by delivering written notice thereof to Supplier; (ii) the Members
may purchase products equivalent to the discontinued or changed Products from
other sources and Supplier will be liable to the Members for all reasonable
costs in excess of the Contract Prices plus any other damages which they may
incur; and (iii) Supplier will be liable to Novation and the Clients for any
loss of Marketing Fees resulting from such unacceptable discontinuation or
change plus any other damages which they may incur.

        e. REPLACEMENT OR NEW PRODUCTS. Supplier will have no unilateral right
to replace any of the Products listed in Exhibit A with other products or to add
new products to this Agreement. Supplier may request Novation in writing to
agree to a replacement of any of the Products or the addition of a new product
that is closely related by function or use to an existing Product at least sixty
(60) days prior to the proposed implementation of the replacement or to the new
product introduction. Under no circumstances will any Product replacement or new
product addition to this Agreement be permitted without Novation's agreement to
the replacement or new product.



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   10

        f. MEMBER SERVICES. Supplier will consult with each Member to identify
the Member's policies relating to access to facilities and personnel. Supplier
will comply with such policies and will establish a specific timetable for sales
calls by sales representatives to satisfy the needs of the Member. Supplier will
promptly respond to Members' reasonable requests for verification of purchase
history. If requested by Novation or any Members, Supplier will provide, at
Supplier's cost, on-site inservice training to Members' personnel for pertinent
Products. Supplier will not make inappropriate use of product usage information
relating to any Members that is purchased from third party sources. Supplier
will not send unsolicited product samples to any Member unless the Member has
given Supplier its express written consent to receiving unsolicited product
samples from Supplier.

        g. PRODUCT DELETION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Novation may delete any one or more of the Products from this
Agreement at any time, at will and without cause, upon not less than sixty (60)
days' prior written notice to Supplier.

        h. RETURN OF PRODUCTS. Any Member or Authorized Distributor, in addition
to and not in limitation of any other rights and remedies, will have the right
to return Products to Supplier in accordance with the policies and requirements
attached hereto as Exhibit F.

        i. FAILURE TO SUPPLY. In the event of Supplier's failure to perform its

        e. RECALL OF PRODUCTS. Supplier will reimburse Authorized Distributors
and Members for any cost associated with any Product corrective action,
withdrawal or recall requested by Supplier or required by any governmental
entity. In the event a product recall or a court action impacting supply occurs,

deliver a summary of the purchasing arrangements covered by this Agreement to
each Member and each Authorized Distributor and will, from time to time, at the
request of Supplier, deliver to each Member and each Authorized Distributor
reasonable and appropriate amounts and types of materials supplied by Supplier

market the purchasing arrangements covered by this Agreement to the Members.
Such promotional services may include, as appropriate, the use of direct mail,
contact by Novation's field service delivery team, member support services, and

activities by inviting Supplier to participate in meetings and other reasonable
networking activities with Members.

9. MARKETING FEES.

        a. CALCULATION. Supplier will pay to Novation, as the authorized
collection agent for each of the Clients and certain of each Client's
subsidiaries and affiliates, respectively (and not



                                      -11-
<PAGE>   16

collectively), marketing fees ("Marketing Fees") belonging to any of the Clients
or certain of their subsidiaries or affiliates equal to the Agreed Percentage of
the aggregate gross charges of all net sales of the Products to the Members
directly or indirectly from Supplier, whether under the pricing and other terms
of this Agreement or under the terms of any other purchasing or pricing
arrangements that may exist between the Members and Supplier. Such gross charges
will be determined without any deduction for uncollected accounts or for costs
incurred in the manufacture, provision, sale or distribution of the Products,
and will include, but not be limited to, charges for the sale of products, the
provision of installation, training and maintenance services, and the provision
of any other services listed on Exhibit A. The "Agreed Percentage" will be
defined in the Non-Price Specifications.

        b. PAYMENT. On or about the Effective Date, Novation will advise
Supplier in writing of the amount determined by Novation to be Supplier's
monthly estimated Marketing Fees. Thereafter, Supplier's monthly estimated
Marketing Fees may be adjusted from time to time upon written notice from
Novation based on actual purchase data. No later than the tenth (10th) day of
each month, Supplier will remit the monthly estimated Marketing Fees for such
month to Novation. Such payment will be adjusted to reflect the reconciliation
between the actual Marketing Fees payable for the second month prior to such
month with the estimated Marketing Fees actually paid during such prior month.
Supplier will pay all estimated and adjusted Marketing Fees by check made
payable to "Novation, LLC." All checks should reference the Agreement number.
Supplier will include with its check the reconciliation calculation used by
Supplier to determine the payment adjustment, with separate amounts shown for
each Client's component thereof. Checks sent by first class mail will be mailed

10. ADMINISTRATIVE DAMAGES. Novation and Supplier agree that Novation would
incur additional administrative costs if Supplier fails to provide notice of
change in pricing terms as required in Subsection 2.f above, fails to provide

Supplier is uncertain, and they therefore agree that the following schedule of
administrative damages constitutes a reasonable estimation of such costs and
were determined according to the principles of just compensation:

1st failure                                             written warning

3rd failure:                                                 $ 1,000.00

may have by reason of Supplier's failure to pay the Marketing Fees or provide
the reports or notices within the time and manner required by this Agreement.

Distributor becomes bankrupt or insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit
of creditors or goes into liquidation, or if proceedings are initiated for the
purpose of having a receiving order or winding up order made against a Member or
Authorized Distributor, or if a Member or Authorized Distributor applies to the
court for protection from its creditors, then, in any such case, this Agreement
will not terminate, but, in the case of an Authorized Distributor, Supplier will
have the right, upon prior written notice to Novation and the Members, to
discontinue providing Products through that Authorized Distributor, and Supplier
will thereafter provide Products to the Members directly or through another
Authorized Distributor, as directed by Novation, and in the case of a Member,

soon as practicable after it receives or gives them.

safety of the Products, occupational health and safety, environmental
protection, nondiscrimination, antitrust, and equal employment opportunity.

                                    EXHIBIT E

                               RETURN OF PRODUCTS

1.      SUPPLIER'S POLICY. Supplier represents that the return goods policy
        attached as Schedule 1 to this Exhibit ("Suppliers Policy") is and will
        continue to be consistent with prevailing practices in the pharmacy
        industry. In reliance on such representation, and subject to the terms
        of this Exhibit, Supplier's Policy is accepted by Novation and Supplier
        agrees to strictly comply with the terms of Supplier's Policy for the
        benefit of the Members and Authorized Distributors with respect to
        Products purchased under this Agreement.

2.      CHANGES TO SUPPLIER'S POLICY. Supplier will have no unilateral right to
        change Supplier's Policy from that set forth in Schedule I hereto during
        the Term. Supplier may request Novation in writing to agree to proposed
        changes to Supplier's Policy, provided that Novation must be given a
        reasonable opportunity (at least sixty (60) days) to review such
        proposed changes prior to any proposed implementation date. Under no
        circumstances will any changes to Supplier's Policy be applicable to
        Products purchased under this Agreement without Novation's agreement to
        the change.

3.      OVERRIDING RETURN RIGHTS. Notwithstanding the terms of Supplier's Policy
        or any contrary provisions elsewhere in this Exhibit, Supplier agrees
        that any Member or Authorized Distributor, in addition to and not in
        limitation of any other rights and remedies, will have the right to
        return any of the Products under the following circumstances without
        charge and for full credit (based on purchase price):

        a.      Return of any dated Product within twelve (12) months after its
                expiration date.

        b.      Return of any Product that is ordered or shipped in error.

        c.      Return of any defective Product.

        d.      Return of any Product that is received in a damaged,
                nonconforming or otherwise unusable condition.

        e.      Return of any recalled Product (see also Section 5.e of the
                Agreement).

4.      DEA FORMS. If requested by the Member or Authorized Distributor,
        Supplier agrees to promptly initiate any DEA forms required for the
        return of Schedule II controlled substances.

5.      WAIVER OF RETURN RIGHTS. Supplier agrees that any Member will have the
        option, to be exercised by written notice to Supplier at any time during
        the Term for purchases after the notice date, of waiving all rights to
        return Products for any reason (except recall) under Supplier's Policy
        or under the terms of this Exhibit in exchange for a right to purchase
        the

6.      PROCEDURE

        6.1     The Return Goods Authorization Log

                6.1.1   All return goods authorizations are logged into the RGA
                        log, an Excel spreadsheet, located in the WFHC directory
                        of y:\\ntserver\users\Customer Service\Returned Goods
                        Authorization\RGA.xls.

                6.1.2   The RGA log contains columns for the following
                        information to be recorded for each RGA:

                        6.1.2.1 Date

                        6.1.2.2 RGA number (assigned as described in section
                        6.2)

                        6.1.2.3 Name of Customer

                        6.1.2.4 Product to be returned

                        6.1.2.5 Distribution Source (LHSI or WFHC)

                        6.1.2.6 Quantity to be returned

        6.2     Assigning RGA numbers

                RGA numbers are 6-digit alpha-numeric codes used to identify
                returned goods, in the format RGAxx-yyy, where:

                        make the Products available for purchase by the
                        Authorized Distributors at the Contract Prices for
                        resale to the Members in accordance with the terms of
                        this Agreement; provided, however, that this Agreement
                        will not constitute a commitment by any person to
                        purchase any of the Products. Supplier may, in its sole
                        discretion and without regard to requests by any other
                        party to this Agreement, make the Products available for
                        purchase directly by Members in limited circumstances,
                        and therefore, any references herein to the Supplier
                        providing the Product directly to Members shall be read
                        in conjunction with this Section 2a.

2              2b       Second paragraph - Within one hundred eighty (180) days
                        of the Effective Date, Supplier must be certified as
                        "Approved" or "Conditionally Approved" by the Committee.
                        In certain instances where the Supplier does not receive
                        the approval of the Committee, the Committee may wish to
                        monitor the Supplier's quality performance and may
                        classify the Supplier as "Conditionally Approved."
                        During the "Conditionally Approved" time period, the
                        Supplier must provide quarterly reports listing any FDA
                        inspections received during the quarter, FD-483
                        observations and warning letters issued, as well as all
                        responses thereto. If no FDA inspections occur, or
                        inspections occur in which there are no observations or
                        warning letters, the "Conditionally Approved" Supplier
                        must so indicate in the quarterly reports. After the 180
                        day grace period, failure by the Supplier to be deemed
                        "Approved" or "Conditionally Approved" by the
                        Committee, in good faith, shall constitute a breach of
                        this Agreement, giving Novation the right to terminate
                        this Agreement.

                        the option of purchasing the Products under the terms of
                        this Agreement or under the terms of any other
                        purchasing or pricing arrangement that may exist between
                        such Member and Supplier at any time during the Term. If

                        when ordering products covered by any contract between
                        Supplier and Novation, Supplier will notify such Member
                        of the pricing and other significant terms of the
                        applicable Novation contract.

                        technology of all Products purchased under this
                        Agreement will remain market competitive at all times
                        during the Term. Supplier agrees to provide prompt
                        written notice to Novation of all offers for the sale of
                        the Products made by Supplier during the Term on terms
                        that are more favorable to the offeree than the terms of
                        this Agreement. Supplier will lower the Contract Prices
                        or increase any discount applicable to the purchase of
                        the Products as necessary to assure market
                        competitiveness. If at any time during the Term,
                        Novation receives information from any source suggesting
                        that Suppliers prices, quality, value or technology are
                        not market competitive, Novation may provide written
                        notice of such information to Supplier, and Supplier
                        will, within five (5) business days for Novation's
                        private label Products and within ten (10) business days
                        for all other Products, advise Novation in writing of
                        and fully implement all adjustments necessary to assure
                        market competitiveness. The terms of this Section 2(d)
                        are limited to comparisons of prices for the Products on
                        other Supplier agreements having like terms and
                        conditions to this Agreement.

3              2e       Unless otherwise expressly agreed in any exhibit to this
                        Agreement, the Contract Prices will not be increased and
                        any discount will not be eliminated or reduced during
                        the Initial Term. In addition to any changes made to
                        assure market competitiveness, Supplier may lower the
                        Contract Prices or increase any discount applicable to
                        the purchase of the Products at an time.

3              3a       This Agreement will be effective as of the effective
                        date set forth in Exhibit D attached hereto (Effective
                        Date"), and, unless sooner terminated, will continue in

                        through Authorized Distributors are 2%-30, Net 31 days.

                        impose any purchasing commitment on an Member or
                        Authorized Distributor as a condition to the Members or


<PAGE>   38

                        Authorized Distributor's purchase of any Products
                        pursuant to this Agreement. No payment discount may

                        subject to such discontinuation or change or to
                        terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately

                        be liable to Novation and the Clients for any loss of
                        Marketing Fees resulting from less than 90 days
                        notification or any discontinuation or change that is
                        not applied to all similarly situated customers plus any
                        other damages, which a court of competent jurisdiction
                        determines, are caused by Supplier against Novation or a
                        Client respecting Supplier's failure to comply with the
                        notification requirements or any discontinuance or
                        change that is not applied to all similarly situated

                        Agreement due to Force Majeure (as defined herein).

                        excuse from performance shall have used its best efforts
                        to minimize the effects of the Force Majeure and resume
                        performance. If such event occurs unabated for a period
                        of forty-five (45) days or longer, the party not
                        claiming the excuse may terminate this Agreement upon

                        electronically transmitting and receiving data in agreed
                        formats in substitution for conventional paper-based
                        documents and to assure that such Transactions are not
                        legally invalid or unenforceable as a result of the use
                        of available electronic technologies for the mutual
                        benefit of the parties. At the time of executing this

                        capable of complying with the requirements set forth in

                        Section 4(b) and 7 of the Agreement and this Exhibit F.
