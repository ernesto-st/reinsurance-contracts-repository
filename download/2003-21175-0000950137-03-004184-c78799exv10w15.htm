thereof, to entities not controlled by the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, an entity shall be deemed controlled by the Company if it holds,
directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting interest of such entity. If a
Change in Control shall occur, any entity that acquires CNA Re and that becomes
the employer of the Executive in connection therewith shall be referred to
herein, together with its affiliates, as the &#147;Successor Entity.&#148;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final and binding determination of whether a sale of the business of

as a result of any other reason or cause.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <B><u>Annual Bonus</u>.</B> The Executive shall receive following the Covered
Termination an amount equal to one (1)&nbsp;times the annual target bonus as in
effect at the time of the Covered Termination, payable in 12 equal monthly
installments.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <B><u>CNA Re Deferred Profit Sharing Plan</u>.</B> For purposes of the CNA Re
Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (DPS), the Executive&#146;s Covered Termination shall
be treated as a termination through retirement, and the Executive shall receive
those amount that would be payable in the event of termination through
retirement pursuant to the terms of the DPS in effect immediately prior to the
Covered Termination.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <B><u>Miscellaneous Items</u>.</B> The Executive shall receive any unpaid base
salary prorated to the date of her termination and any previous year&#146;s earned,
but unpaid annual bonus.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <B><u>Welfare Benefits</u>.</B> Provided they are maintained by the Company, the
Executive shall be entitled to coverage and benefits under the Company&#146;s
benefit programs, on substantially the same terms as were in effect immediately
prior to a Covered Termination, including any applicable co-payments or
premiums to be paid by the Executive, for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year following
the Executive&#146;s Covered Termination (the &#147;Continuation Period&#148;), under the
medical, dental and group life insurance plans in which the Executive was
participating at the time of the Covered Termination, as though the Executive&#146;s
termination of employment had not occurred. (The benefits and coverages to be
provided under this paragraph (f)&nbsp;are hereinafter referred to as &#147;Welfare
Continuation Coverages&#148;.) All Welfare Continuation Coverages shall apply to the
Executive and any of the Executive&#146;s dependents as and to the extent they would
have been eligible for coverage if the Executive had continued to be employed
by the Company during the Continuation Period. The Company may provide the
Executive with the Welfare Continuation Coverages under arrangements other than
pursuant to the generally applicable welfare benefit plans of the Company in
which the Executive was previously participating, provided that the benefits
and coverages so provided are at least as favorable to the Executive as
coverage under the otherwise applicable Welfare Continuation Coverages, on a
coverage by coverage basis, and taking into account all tax consequences to the
Executive. The Executive&#146;s entitlement to &#147;COBRA&#148; continuation coverages for
medical and dental benefits under section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code
(or any successor provision thereto) shall run concurrent with Welfare
Continuation Coverages.

the Miscellaneous Items set forth in Section&nbsp;2(d) above and she shall be

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><u>Termination Prior To End Date By The Company Without Cause</u>.</B> In the
