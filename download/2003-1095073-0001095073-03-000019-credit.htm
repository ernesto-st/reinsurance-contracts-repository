<U>Reliance by Administrative Agent</U>. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any notice, statement, consent or
other communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone, telecopy,
telex, telegram or cable) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons. The Administrative Agent
may deem and treat each Lender as the owner of its interest hereunder for all purposes
hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, negotiation or transfer
thereof shall have been given to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from
taking or omitting to take any action in connection with this Agreement or any other
Credit Document (i)&nbsp;if such action or omission would, in the reasonable opinion of
the Administrative Agent, violate any applicable law or any provision of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document or (ii)&nbsp;unless and until it shall have received such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, where a higher percentage of the
Lenders is expressly required hereunder, such Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it
shall first have been indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all
liability and expense (other than liability and expense arising from its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) that may be incurred by it by reason of taking,
continuing to take or omitting to take any such action. Without limiting the foregoing,
no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a
result of the Administrative Agent&#146;s acting or refraining from acting hereunder or
under any other Credit Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required
Lenders (or, where a higher percentage of the Lenders is expressly required hereunder,
such Lenders), and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders (including all subsequent Lenders).  </FONT></P>

<U>Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders</U>. Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representation or
warranty to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent or any such Person hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any
Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, properties,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to the Borrower
hereunder, and (ii)&nbsp;it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action hereunder and under the other
Credit Documents and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as
to the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no
duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
properties, financial or other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries or any other Person that may at any time come into the possession of the
Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.  </FONT></P>

<U>Notice of Default</U>. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from the Borrower or a Lender referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
&#147;notice of default.&#148; In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to the Lenders as soon as
reasonably practicable; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if any such notice has also
been furnished to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to
notify the Lenders with respect thereto. The Administrative Agent shall (subject to <B>Sections&nbsp;9.4
</B>and <B>10.6</B>) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
shall reasonably be directed by the Required Lenders; <U>provided</U>that, unless and
until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of the Lenders except to the extent that this Agreement expressly
requires that such action be taken, or not be taken, only with the consent or upon the
authorization of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders.  </FONT></P>

<U>Indemnification</U>. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed by or on
behalf of the Borrower, and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so, the
Lenders agree (i)&nbsp;to indemnify the Administrative Agent and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact and Affiliates, ratably in proportion to their
respective percentages as used in determining the Required Lenders as of the date of
determination, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the
repayment in full of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action
taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the
foregoing, and (ii)&nbsp;to reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand, ratably in
proportion to their respective percentages as used in determining the Required Lenders as
of the date of determination, for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, administration,
amendment, modification, waiver or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities
under, this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses and compensation of agents and
employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the
extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be
indemnified.  </FONT></P>

<U>The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity</U>. With respect to its
Commitment, the Loans made by it and the Note or Notes issued to it, the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under the Credit Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not performing the agency duties specified herein; and the terms
&#147;Lenders,&#148; &#147;Required Lenders,&#148;&#147;holders of Notes&#148; and any
similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in, and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with the
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates as if the
Administrative Agent were not performing the agency duties specified herein, and may
accept fees and other consideration from any of them for services in connection with this
Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.9
<U>Successor Agent</U>. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten
(10) days&#146; prior written notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. Upon any such
notice of resignation, the Required Lenders will, with the prior written consent of the
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), appoint from among the
Lenders a successor to the Administrative Agent <U>(provided</U> that the Borrower&#146;s
consent shall not be required in the event an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing). If no successor to the Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within such ten-day period,
then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and after consulting
with the Lenders and the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent from among
the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents. After any
retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions
of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent. If no successor to the Administrative Agent has
accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the thirtieth (30th) day following a
retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent&#146;s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders
shall thereafter perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and
under the other Credit Documents until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint
a successor Administrative Agent as provided for hereinabove.  </FONT></P>

<U>however</U>, that no Indemnified Person shall have the right to be indemnified
hereunder for any Indemnified Costs to the extent determined by a final and nonappealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to arbitration as set forth
herein to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Person. All of the foregoing Indemnified Costs of any Indemnified Person
shall be paid or reimbursed by the Borrower, as and when incurred and upon demand.  </FONT></P>
