this Agreement prior to Closing of any matters which make any of Seller&#146;s representations or warranties untrue in any material respect, such representations and warranties shall be deemed modified to reflect such matters and Seller shall bear
no liability for such matters, but Purchaser shall have the right to elect in writing within 5 days after becoming aware of any such matter, but in no event later than the Closing Date, (i)&nbsp;as to any matter disclosed following the expiration of
the Due Diligence Period, to terminate this Agreement and receive a prompt return of the Earnest Money, or (ii)&nbsp;to waive such matter and complete the purchase of the Property without reduction of the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (and any failure to give notice under clause (i)&nbsp;shall be deemed to constitute such a waiver). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>ARTICLE 10:
