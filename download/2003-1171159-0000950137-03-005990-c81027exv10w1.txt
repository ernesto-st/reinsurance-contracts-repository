         2.2      BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF LOANS.

                  (a)      Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one
         Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
         be made upon the irrevocable notice (except as provided in Section 3.3)
         from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by
         telephone (provided that such telephonic notice complies with the
         information requirements of the form of Loan Notice attached hereto).
         Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later
         than 11:00 a.m. (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date
         of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate
         Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate
         Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section
         2.2(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative
         Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a
         Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Except in the case of a Revolving
         Loan borrowing the proceeds of which are to be applied to make a
         payment under the Construction Loan Documents on behalf of the Borrower
         in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2(b), each Borrowing of,
         conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a
         principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in
         excess thereof. Except as provided in Section 2.3(c) or in the case of
         a Borrowing of the then entire unborrowed amount of the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitment or in the case of a Revolving Loan borrowing the
         proceeds of which are to be applied to make a payment under the
         Construction Loan Documents on behalf of the Borrower in accordance
         with the terms of Section 2.2(b), each Borrowing of or conversion to
         Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole
         multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether
         telephonic or written) shall specify (A) whether the Borrower is
         requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the
         other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (B) the requested
         date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be
         (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of Loans to
         be borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Type of Loans to be
         borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (E) if
         applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.
         If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if
         the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or
         continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted
         to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans
         shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
         effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the
         Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of
         Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an
         Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period
         of one (1) month.

                  (b)      Subject to the other terms and conditions set forth
         herein (including without limitation satisfaction of the conditions
         precedent set forth in Section 5.2), the Borrower hereby agrees that,
         until such time as all of the obligations of the Borrower under the
         Construction Loan Documents shall have been paid in full and Baxter
         Springs shall have released all of its Liens in any Property of the
         Borrower or any of the other Credit Parties, Baxter Springs (or KDOCH
         on behalf of Baxter Springs) shall be authorized to request

                                       35

<PAGE>

         that Revolving Loans be made on behalf of the Borrower for application
         to any obligations which are past due under the Construction Loan
         Documents. Requests for Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)
         shall be made pursuant to a written Loan Notice signed by either the
         Mayor of Baxter Springs or the Secretary of KDOCH, substantially in
         accordance with the terms of Section 2.2(a) above. The proceeds of each
         Revolving Loan made pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) shall be paid to
         the account and in accordance with the wiring instructions set forth in
         the related Loan Notice for application to the past due obligations of
         the Borrower under the Construction Loan Documents. Revolving Loans
         made pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) on any day shall not exceed the
         aggregate amount of amounts which are past due under the Construction
         Loan Documents on such date. On the date that any Revolving Loans are
         to be made pursuant to this Section 2.2(b), the Administrative Agent
         shall so notify the Borrower and shall send to the Borrower a copy of
         the related Loan Notice. The Borrower hereby agrees (A) that the
         Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully
         protected in acting upon and in accordance with, any Loan Notice
         delivered by or on behalf of Baxter Springs pursuant to this Section
         2.2(b) and believed in good faith by the Administrative Agent to be
         genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by or on
         behalf of the Mayor of Baxter Springs or the Secretary of KDOCH, even
         if such Loan Notice should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
         invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged, (B) that the
         Administrative Agent shall not be required to confirm or verify with
         the Borrower or any other Person the appropriateness or accuracy of any
         Loan Notice delivered by or on behalf of Baxter Springs pursuant to
         this Section 2.2(b), (C) to hold the Administrative Agent and the
         Lenders harmless in respect of any Revolving Loan advances made
         available to Baxter Springs pursuant to and in accordance with the
         terms of this Section 2.2(b), (D) that as between the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the Borrower shall assume all
         risks of the acts of Baxter Springs or KDOCH pursuant to this Section
         2.2(b), (E) that any action taken or omitted by the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender pursuant to or in connection with any Loan Notice
         delivered by or on behalf of Baxter Springs pursuant to this Section
         2.2(b), if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender under any resulting liability to
         the Borrower or any other Credit Party and (F) the provisions of this
         Section 2.2(b) shall be construed and applied to protect and exculpate
         the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against any and all risks
         involved in the making of Revolving Loan advances pursuant to this
         Section 2.2(b), all of which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower
         (on behalf of itself and each of the other Credit Parties), provided
         that such provisions shall not be deemed to protect or exculpate the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of any action or inaction
         of such Person constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  (c)      Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the
         Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the
         amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if
         no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the
         Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender
         of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described
         in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Revolving
         Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to the
         Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the
         Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business
         Day

                                       36

         specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the
         applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (and, if such Borrowing
         is the initial Credit Extension, Section 5.1), the Administrative Agent
         shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like
         funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting
         the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the
         amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case
         in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable
         to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that
         if, on the date a Loan Notice with respect to a Borrowing consisting of
         Revolving Loans is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings
         outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied,
         first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second,
         to the Borrower as provided above.

                  (d)      Subject to Section 3.5, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
         continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for
         such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default or an
         Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or
         continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required
         Lenders.

                  (e)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
         Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any
         Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such
         interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the
         Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
         error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the
         Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any
         change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base
         Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

                  (f)      After giving effect to all Borrowings, all
         conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations
         of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than (i) five
         Interest Periods in effect with respect to Revolving Loans, and (ii)
         four Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Term Loans.

         2.3      LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a)      The Letter of Credit Commitment.

                           (i)      Subject to the terms and conditions set
                  forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the
                  agreements of the Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section
                  2.3, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the
                  period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit
                  Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of
                  the Borrower or, subject to the terms of Section 2.3(l), any
                  Subsidiary designated by the Borrower, and to amend or renew
                  Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with
                  subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drafts under the
                  Letters of Credit; and (B) the Revolving Lenders severally
                  agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the
                  account of the Borrower; provided that the L/C Issuer shall
                  not be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect
                  to any Letter of Credit, and no Revolving Lender shall be

                                       37

<PAGE>

                  obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the
                  date of such L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Total Revolving
                  Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments,
                  (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of
                  any Revolving Lender, plus such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata
                  Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations would
                  exceed such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment, or (z)
                  the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the
                  Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and
                  subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's
                  ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving,
                  and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period,
                  obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that
                  have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. Each
                  Letter of Credit shall be either (x) a standby letter of
                  credit issued to support the obligations (including pension or
                  insurance obligations), contingent or otherwise, of a Credit
                  Party, or (y) a commercial letter of credit in respect of the
                  purchase of goods or services by the Borrower or any of its
                  Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. All Existing
                  Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant
                  hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject
                  to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

                           (ii)     The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation
                  to issue any Letter of Credit if:

                                    (A)      any order, judgment or decree of
                           any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its
                           terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer
                           from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law
                           applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or
                           directive (whether or not having the force of law)
                           from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
                           over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that
                           the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters
                           of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in
                           particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with
                           respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
                           reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C
                           Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in
                           effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the
                           L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense
                           which was not applicable on the Closing Date and
                           which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to
                           it;

                                    (B)      subject to Section 2.3(b)(iii), the
                           expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
                           occur more than twelve (12) months after the date of
                           issuance unless all of the Revolving Lenders have
                           approved such expiry date;

                                    (C)      the expiry date of such requested
                           Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of
                           Credit Expiration Date, unless such Letter of Credit
                           has been Cash Collateralized to the reasonable
                           satisfaction of the Administrative Agent and the L/C
                           Issuer or unless all of the Required Revolving
                           Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                                       38

<PAGE>

                                    (D)      the issuance of such Letter of
                           Credit would violate one or more written policies of
                           the L/C Issuer;

                                    (E)      if such Letter of Credit (1) is a
                           standby Letter of Credit, such standby Letter of
                           Credit is in an initial amount less than $500,000 or
                           (2) is a commercial Letter of Credit, such commercial
                           Letter of Credit is in an initial amount less than
                           $250,000; or

                                    (F)      such Letter of Credit is to be used
                           for a purpose other than as specified in Section
                           2.3(a) or is to be denominated in a currency other
                           than Dollars.

                           (iii)    The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation
                  to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have
                  no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in
                  its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the
                  beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the
                  proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

                  (b)      Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of
                           Credit; Automatic Renewal of Letters of Credit.

                           (i)      Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or
                  amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower
                  delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative
                  Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application,
                  appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of
                  the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
                  received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not
                  later than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such
                  later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a
                  particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the
                  proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may
                  be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a
                  Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
                  specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A)
                  the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit
                  (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C)
                  the expiry date thereof; (D) the name of the account party
                  thereof and the name and address of the beneficiary thereof;
                  (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case
                  of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any
                  certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any
                  drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C
                  Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an
                  amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of
                  Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
                  satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be
                  amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which
                  shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed
                  amendment; and (4) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may
                  reasonably require.

                           (ii)     Promptly after receipt of any Letter of
                  Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the
                  Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
                  Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of
                  Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C
                  Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
                  thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from
                  the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or
                  amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof,
                  then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C
                  Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
                  for the account of the Borrower or, subject to the terms of
                  Section 2.3(l), any Subsidiary designated by the Borrower, or
                  enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in
                  each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and
                  customary business practices for commercial and standby
                  letters of credit, as applicable. Immediately upon the
                  issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall
                  be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
                  agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer without recourse a
                  risk participation in such Letter of Credit and the
                  obligations arising thereunder and any collateral relating
                  thereto in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving
                  Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of
                  Credit. On the Closing Date, each Revolving Lender shall be
                  deemed to have purchased from the L/C Issuer without recourse
                  a risk participation in each Existing Letter of Credit and the
                  obligations arising thereunder and any collateral relating
                  thereto in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving
                  Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Existing
                  Letter of Credit.

                           (iii)    If the Borrower so requests in any
                  applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may,
                  in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter
                  of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an
                  "Auto Renewal Letter of Credit"); provided that any such Auto
                  Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent
                  any such renewal at least once in each twelve (12) month
                  period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of
                  Credit) by giving prior notice to the Borrower and the
                  beneficiary thereof not later than the day, in each such
                  twelve (12) month period, agreed upon at the time such Letter
                  of Credit is issued (the "Nonrenewal Notice Date"). Unless
                  otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not
                  be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for
                  any such renewal. Once an Auto Renewal Letter of Credit has
                  been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have
                  authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the
                  renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date
                  not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (unless
                  such Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized to the
                  reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent and the
                  L/C Issuer in which case such Letter of Credit may be extended
                  beyond the Letter of Credit Expiration Date); provided,
                  however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal
                  if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no
                  obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its
                  renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the
                  provisions of Section 2.3(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has
                  received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on
                  or before the day that is five (5)

                  Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the
                  Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or
                  more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 is
                  not then satisfied or (2) from the Borrower electing not to
                  agree to such renewal.

                           (iv)     Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of
                  Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising
                  bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the
                  L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter
                  of Credit or amendment. Upon the request of any Lender, the
                  Administrative Agent will deliver to such Lender a list of the
                  Letters of Credit then outstanding.

                  (c)      Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of
                           Participations.

                           (i)      Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any
                  Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter
                  of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. (or if
                  the notice of drawing on such Letter of Credit is given after
                  11:00 a.m., then not later than 12:00 noon on the next
                  succeeding Business Day) on the date of any payment by the L/C
                  Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor
                  Date"), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through
                  the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of
                  such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C
                  Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
                  notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of
                  the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the
                  amount of such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In
                  such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a
                  Borrowing of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to be
                  disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the
                  Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
                  multiples specified in, or the notice requirement of, Section
                  2.2 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject
                  to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate
                  Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section
                  5.2 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any notice
                  given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant
                  to this Section 2.3(c)(i) may be given by telephone if
                  immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of
                  such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
                  conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

                           (ii)     Each Revolving Lender (including the
                  Revolving Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice
                  pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) make funds available to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the
                  Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro
                  Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m.
                  on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
                  Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
                  Section 2.3(c)(i) and (iii), each Revolving Lender that so
                  makes funds available shall either (A) be deemed to have made
                  a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in
                  such amount in accordance with the terms of Section

                                       41

<PAGE>

                  2.3(c)(i) or (B) be deemed to have made an L/C Advance to fund
                  its participation interest in an L/C Borrowing in such amount
                  in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3(c)(iii). The
                  Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the
                  L/C Issuer.

                           (iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that
                  is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Revolving Loans that
                  are Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in
                  Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied (other than delivery of a Loan
                  Notice) or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed
                  to have incurred from the L/C Issuer a L/C Borrowing in the
                  amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced,
                  which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
                  (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the
                  Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Lender's payment
                  to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
                  pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in
                  respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
                  constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in
                  satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
                  Section 2.3.

                           (iv)     Until each Revolving Lender funds its
                  Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)
                  to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any Unreimbursed Amount under
                  any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving
                  Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
                  account of the L/C Issuer.

                           (v)      Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make
                  Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer
                  for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by
                  this Section 2.3(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and
                  shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any
                  set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
                  which such Revolving Lender may have against the L/C Issuer,
                  the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever;
                  (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of
                  Default, (C) the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in
                  Section 5.2 or (D) any other occurrence, event or condition,
                  whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided,
                  however, that each Revolving Lender's obligation to make
                  Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) is subject to
                  the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than delivery
                  by the Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C
                  Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
                  the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any
                  payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit,
                  together with interest as provided herein.

                           (vi)     If any Revolving Lender fails to make
                  available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
                  L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving
                  Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
                  2.3(c) by the time specified in Section 2.3(c)(ii), the L/C
                  Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender
                  (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
                  amount with interest thereon for the

                                       42

<PAGE>

                  period from the date such payment is required to the date on
                  which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer
                  at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time
                  to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted
                  to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent)
                  with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall
                  be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                           (i)      At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a
                  payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any
                  Revolving Lender such Revolving Lender's L/C Advance in
                  respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.3(c), if
                  the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C
                  Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed
                  Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower
                  or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied
                  thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent
                  will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share
                  thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
                  payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
                  Revolving Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same
                  funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

                           (ii)     If any payment received by the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
                  pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) is required to be returned under
                  any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including
                  pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in
                  its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro
                  Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus
                  interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
                  amount is returned by such Revolving Lender, at a rate per
                  annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
                  effect.

                  (e)      Credit Party Obligations Absolute. The obligation of
         the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each
         Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute,
         unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance
         with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all circumstances,
         including the following:

                           (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of
                  such Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other
                  agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                           (ii)     the existence of any claim, counterclaim,
                  set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at
                  any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such
                  Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary
                  or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any
                  other Person, whether in connection with this Credit
                  Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
                  Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating
                  thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                                       43

<PAGE>

                           (iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other
                  document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be
                  forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
                  any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
                  respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
                  of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
                  Letter of Credit;

                           (iv)     any payment by the L/C Issuer under such
                  Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
                  certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of
                  such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer
                  under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
                  trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the
                  benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
                  representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any
                  transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in
                  connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                           (v)      any other circumstance or happening
                  whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
                  including any other circumstance that might otherwise
                  constitute a defense (other than payment) available to, or a
                  discharge of, the Borrower.

                  The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of
         Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the
         event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or
         other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly notify the L/C Issuer.
         The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim
         against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is
         given as aforesaid.

                  (f)      Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Lender and the
         Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit,
         the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document
         (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly
         required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the
         validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the
         Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C
         Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective
         correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be
         liable to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in
         connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders
         or the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken
         or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or
         (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of
         any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of
         Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
         or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use
         of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not
         intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such
         rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
         transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer,
         any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents,
         participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or

                                       44

<PAGE>

         responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v)
         of Section 2.3(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to
         the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the
         L/C Issuer or any such Agent-Related Person, correspondent, participant
         or assignee, and the L/C Issuer or any such Agent-Related Person,
         correspondent, participant or assignee may be liable to the Borrower,
         to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
         consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the
         Borrower proves were caused by such party's willful misconduct or gross
         negligence or, with respect to the L/C Issuer only, the L/C Issuer's
         willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the
         presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
         certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a
         Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
         foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their
         face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation,
         regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C
         Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any
         instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or
         assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
         proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
         ineffective for any reason.

                  (g)      Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the
         Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or
         partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has
         resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit
         Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason remain
         outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
         immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
         Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined
         as of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Expiration
         Date, as the case may be). The Borrower hereby grants to the
         Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the
         Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all
         balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral
         shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts
         at Bank of America.

                  (h)      Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise
         expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a
         Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to
         an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the "International
         Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of International
         Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
         effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of
         Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
         Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International
         Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance shall apply to
         each commercial Letter of Credit.

                  (i)      Letter of Credit Fees.

                           (i)      The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
                  Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance
                  with its Pro Rata Share a fee (the "Standby Letter of Credit
                  Fee") for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the

                                       45

<PAGE>

                  Applicable Percentage times the daily maximum amount available
                  to be drawn under such standby Letter of Credit (whether or
                  not such maximum amount is then in effect under such standby
                  Letter of Credit). The Standby Letter of Credit Fees shall be
                  computed on a quarterly basis in arrears, and shall be due and
                  payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March,
                  June, September and December, commencing with the first such
                  date to occur after the issuance of such standby Letter of
                  Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter
                  on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Percentage
                  during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each standby
                  Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the
                  Applicable Percentage separately for each period during such
                  quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in effect.

                           (ii)     The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
                  Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance
                  with its Pro Rata Share a fee (the "Commercial Letter of
                  Credit Fee") for each commercial Letter of Credit equal to the
                  Applicable Percentage times the daily maximum amount available
                  to be drawn under such commercial Letter of Credit (whether or
                  not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
                  commercial Letter of Credit). The Commercial Letter of Credit
                  Fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears, and
                  shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the
                  end of each March, June, September and December, commencing
                  with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such
                  commercial Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit
                  Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any
                  change in the Applicable Percentage during any quarter, the
                  daily maximum amount of each commercial Letter of Credit shall
                  be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Percentage
                  separately for each period during such quarter that such
                  Applicable Percentage was in effect.

                  (j)      Fronting Fee and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
         Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own
         account a fronting fee for each Letter of Credit equal to 0.125% times
         the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
         Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
         Letter of Credit). Such fronting fee for each Letter of Credit shall be
         computed on a quarterly basis in arrears, and shall be due and payable
         on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September
         and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
         issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration
         Date and thereafter on demand. In addition, the Borrower shall pay
         directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance,
         presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard
         costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as
         from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and
         charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

                  (k)      Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the
         event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any
         Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control.

                  (l)      Designation of Subsidiaries as Account Parties.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit
         Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.3(a), a Letter of
         Credit issued hereunder (including any Existing Letter of Credit) shall
         upon the request of the Borrower be issued for the account of any
         Subsidiary of the Borrower, provided that notwithstanding such request,
         the Borrower shall be the actual account party for all purposes of this
         Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such request shall not
         affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect
         to such Letter of Credit.

         2.4      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments of Loans. The Borrower may,
         upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time (i)
         voluntarily prepay Base Rate Loans in whole or in part without premium
         or penalty, and (ii) subject to Section 3.5 hereof, voluntarily prepay
         Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;
         provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative
         Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three (3) Business Days prior to
         any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of
         prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate
         Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple
         of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal amount
         thereof then outstanding); and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans
         shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of
         $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal amount
         thereof then outstanding). Any such voluntary prepayment shall be
         applied to the outstanding Loans as the Borrower may elect. Each notice
         of a voluntary prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) shall specify
         the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be
         prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of
         its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Pro
         Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower,
         the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
         specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified
         therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied
         by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts
         required pursuant to Section 3.5. As among the applicable Lenders, each
         such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in
         accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i)      Aggregate Revolving Commitments. If for any
                  reason the Total Revolving Outstandings at any time exceed the
                  Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect, the Borrower
                  shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans and/or Cash
                  Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
                  to such excess (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in
                  Section 2.4(c) below); provided, however, that the Borrower
                  shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C
                  Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)(i) unless after
                  the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans the Total
                  Revolving Outstandings exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.

                                       47

                           (ii)     Excess Cash Flow. Within ten (10) Business
                  Days after the date the audited financial statements are
                  required to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(a) for each
                  fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending December
                  31, 2004, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an amount
                  equal to 50% of the Excess Cash Flow earned during the
                  preceding fiscal year (such prepayment to be applied as set
                  forth in Section 2.4(c) below).

                           (iii)    (A)      Asset Dispositions. Within three
                           (3) Business Days after the occurrence of any Asset
                           Disposition Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall
                           prepay the Loans and Cash Collateralize the L/C
                           Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of
                           the Net Cash Proceeds of the related Asset
                           Disposition not applied (or caused to be applied) by
                           the Credit Parties during the related Application
                           Period to make Eligible Reinvestments as contemplated
                           by the terms of Section 8.5(e) (such prepayment to be
                           applied as set forth in Section 2.4(c) below);
                           provided that up to $1,500,000 of the Net Cash
                           Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of all or
                           any portion of the Detroit Paper Mill or any assets
                           comprising the Detroit Paper Mill shall be excluded
                           from the foregoing prepayment requirements.

                                    (B)      Casualty and Condemnation Events.

                           of any event requiring application of any insurance
                           proceeds to the prepayment of Loans and Cash
                           Collateralization of the L/C Obligations pursuant to
                           Section 7.7(d), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
                           and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in the
                           amount required by such Section 7.7(d) (such
                           prepayment to be applied as set forth in Section
                           2.4(c) below).

                           (iv)     Issuances of Equity. Within three (3)
                  Business Days after the receipt by a Credit Party of proceeds
                  from any Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
                  and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal
                  to 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance (such
                  prepayment to be applied as set forth in Section 2.4(c)
                  below).

                           (v)      Issuance of Debt. Within three (3) Business
                  Days after receipt by a Credit Party of proceeds from any Debt

                  Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 100%
                  of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance (such
                  prepayment to be applied as set forth in Section 2.4(c)
                  below).

                  (c)      Application of Prepayments. All amounts required to
         be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i) shall be applied first to

         and (v) above shall be applied first, pro rata to the outstanding
         Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans and within each
         tranche pro rata among the remaining Principal Amortization Payments,
         until the Term Loans have been paid in full,

                                       48

<PAGE>

         second, to the Revolving Loans (without a corresponding reduction in
         the Aggregate Revolving Commitments), and third, to Cash Collateralize
         the outstanding L/C Obligations. All amounts required to be paid
         pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(iii) above shall be applied first, pro rata
         to the outstanding Revolving Loans (with a corresponding reduction in
         the Aggregate Revolving Commitments), Tranche A Term Loans and Tranche
         B Term Loans (and within each tranche pro rata among the remaining
         Principal Amortization Payments), and second, to Cash Collateralize the
         outstanding L/C Obligations. Within the parameters of the applications
         set forth above, prepayments shall be applied ratably to Base Rate
         Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans. All prepayments hereunder shall be
         subject to Section 3.5 and shall be accompanied by interest on the
         principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment. One or more
         holders of the Tranche B Term Loans may decline to accept a mandatory
         prepayment under Sections 2.4(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) to the extent
         there are sufficient Tranche A Term Loans outstanding (and/or, in the
         case of a mandatory prepayment under Section 2.4(b)(iii), sufficient
         Revolving Loans or L/C Obligations outstanding) to be paid with such
         prepayment, in which case such declined prepayments shall be allocated
         pro rata among the Tranche A Term Loans (and, in the case of a
         mandatory prepayment under Section 2.4(b)(iii), the Revolving Loans and
         L/C Obligations outstanding) and the Tranche B Term Loans held by
         Lenders accepting such prepayments. Notwithstanding anything in this
         Section 2.4(c) to the contrary, the Aggregate Revolving Commitments
         shall not be reduced below $30,000,000 as a result of any reduction of
         the Aggregate Revolving Commitments corresponding to a mandatory
         prepayment of Revolving Loans and/or Cash Collateralization of L/C
         Obligations hereunder.

                  (d)      Eurodollar Prepayment Account. If the Borrower is
         required to make a mandatory prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans under
         Section 2.4(b), notwithstanding any term of Section 2.4(b) or (c) to
         the contrary, the Borrower shall have the right, in lieu of making such
         prepayment in full, to deposit an amount equal to such mandatory
         prepayment with the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account
         maintained (pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent) by and in the sole dominion and control of the
         Administrative Agent. Any amounts so deposited shall be held by the
         Administrative Agent as collateral for the prepayment of such
         Eurodollar Rate Loans and shall be applied to the prepayment of the
         applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans at the end of the current Interest
         Periods applicable thereto. At the request of the Borrower, amounts so
         deposited shall be invested by the Administrative Agent in Cash
         Equivalents maturing on or prior to the date or dates on which it is
         anticipated that such amounts will be applied to prepay such Eurodollar
         Rate Loans; any interest earned on such Cash Equivalents will be for
         the account of the Borrower and the Borrower will deposit with the
         Administrative Agent the amount of any loss on any such Cash
         Equivalents to the extent necessary in order that the amount of the
         prepayment to be made with the deposited amounts may not be reduced.

         2.5      TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF AGGREGATE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower may, upon notice
         to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments, or from time to

                                       49

<PAGE>

         time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments; provided
         that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent
         not later than 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the date of
         termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in
         an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000
         in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to
         any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings
         would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (iv) if, after
         giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments,
         the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit shall be
         automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.

                  (b)      Mandatory Reductions. The Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments automatically shall be permanently reduced from time to
         time in accordance with the terms of Section 2.4(c).

                  (c)      General. The Administrative Agent will promptly
         notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of
         the Aggregate Revolving Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the Revolving Commitment of
         each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All Commitment Fees
         accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such
         termination.

         2.6      REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

                  (a)      Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the
         Lenders on the applicable Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount
         of Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

                  (b)      Tranche A Term Loan. The Borrower shall repay the
         outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loan in twenty (20)
         consecutive quarterly installments (as such installments may hereafter
         be adjusted as a result of prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.4) on
         the last Business Day of each month set forth below and on the
         applicable Maturity Date, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section
         9.2:

         2.7      INTEREST.

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below,
         (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
         principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum
         equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the
         Applicable Percentage; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest
         on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
         borrowing date to the payment date at a rate per annum equal to the
         Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

                  (b)      If any amount payable by the Borrower under any
         Credit Document is not paid when due (after the expiration of any
         applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
         or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
         fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default
         Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore,
         while any Event of Default exists, after written notice to the
         Borrower, the Borrower shall pay (i) interest on the principal amount
         of all outstanding Credit Party Obligations which bear interest at a
         fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default
         Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws and (ii) all
         Letter of Credit fees and other fees payable pursuant to Section 2.3(i)
         and (j) shall accrue at a per annum rate 2% greater than the rate which
         would otherwise be applicable. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due
         amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and
         payable upon demand.

                  (c)      Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in
         arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such
         other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due
         and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after
         judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under
         any Debtor Relief Law.

         2.8      FEES.

         In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j) of
Section 2.3:

                  (a)      Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with
         its Pro Rata Share, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to
         the Applicable Percentage times the actual daily amount by which the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed the Total Revolving
         Outstandings. The Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the
         Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of
         the conditions in Section 5 is not met, and shall be due and payable
         quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
         September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur
         after the Closing Date, and on the applicable Maturity Date. The
         Commitment Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there
         is any change in the Applicable

                                       52
<PAGE>

         Percentage during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be
         computed and multiplied by the Applicable Percentage separately for
         each period during such quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in
         effect.

                  (b)      Other Fees.

                           (i)      The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and
                  the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts
                  fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee
                  Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall
                  not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

                           (ii)     The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such
                  fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in
                  the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be
                  fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any
                  reason whatsoever.

         2.9      COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

         All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is
determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other
computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year
and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable,
being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue
on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion
is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is
made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a), bear interest for one (1) day.

         2.10     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a)      The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be
         evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender
         and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The
         accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each
         Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the
         Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest
         and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so
         shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
         Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Credit
         Party Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts
         and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of
         the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and
         records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
         manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the
         Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
         Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a promissory note which shall
         evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records.
         Each such promissory note shall (i) in the case of Revolving Loans, be
         in the form of Exhibit D-1 (as amended, modified, restated,
         supplemented, extended, renewed, or replaced from time to

                                       53

<PAGE>

         time, a "Revolving Note"), (ii) in the case of the Tranche A Term Loan,
         be in the form of Exhibit D-2 (as amended, modified, restated,
         supplemented, extended, renewed, or replaced from time to time, a
         "Tranche A Term Note") and (iii) in the case of the Tranche B Term
         Loan, be in the form of Exhibit D-3 (as amended, modified, restated,
         supplemented, extended, renewed, or replaced from time to time, a
         "Tranche B Term Note"). Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note or
         Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and
         maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

                  (b)      In addition to the accounts and records referred to
         in subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall
         maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records
         evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in
         Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts
         and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and
         records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and
         records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
         manifest error.

         2.11     PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

                  (a)      Subject to Section 3.1, all payments to be made by
         the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any
         counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise
         expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall
         be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective
         Lenders or the L/C Issuer to which such payment is owed, at the
         Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available
         funds, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The
         Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to the L/C Issuer and/or
         each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided
         herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to
         such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the
         Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the
         next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall
         continue to accrue.

                  (b)      If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come
         due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the
         next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be
         reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

                  (c)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
         Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be
         made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or
         such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as
         the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be
         so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding
         amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such
         payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately
         available funds, then:

                           (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment,
                  each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the
                  Administrative Agent the portion of such

                                       54

<PAGE>

                  assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in
                  immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
                  respect of each day from and including the date such amount
                  was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender
                  to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent
                  in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from
                  time to time in effect; and

                           (ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment,
                  such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the
                  Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately
                  available funds, together with interest thereon for the period
                  from the date such amount was made available by the
                  Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount
                  is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation
                  Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
                  from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount
                  to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute
                  such Lender's Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If
                  such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
                  Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
                  Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the
                  Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent,
                  together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at
                  a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to
                  the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
                  relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its
                  Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative
                  Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result
                  of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the
         Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c)
         shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

                  (d)      If any Lender makes available to the Administrative
         Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the
         foregoing provisions of this Section 2, and such funds are not made
         available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the
         conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Section 5
         are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the
         Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as
         received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

                  (e)      The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
         Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit are several and
         not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any
         such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any
         other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and
         no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
         so make its Loan or purchase its participation.

                  (f)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender
         to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or
         to constitute a representation by any

                                       55

<PAGE>

         Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in
         any particular place or manner.

         2.12     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall
obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C
Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share
(or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately
(a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the
other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such
subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations held by them, as the
case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may
be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any
of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such
purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount
equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)
the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount
so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered,
without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to Section 11.9) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall
be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations
purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following
any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation
pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to
give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under
this Credit Agreement with respect to the portion of the Credit Party
Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were
the original owner of the Credit Party Obligations purchased.

                                    SECTION 3

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.1      TAXES.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for
         the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Credit
         Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
         and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
         assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities
         with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the Administrative
         Agent and each Lender,

                                       56

<PAGE>

         taxes imposed on or measured by its overall net income, branch profit
         taxes and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes),
         by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the
         Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
         be, is organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded
         taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
         withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter
         referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall be required by any
         Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under
         any Credit Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i)
         except as provided in Section 11.15(a), the sum payable shall be
         increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
         (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
         Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an
         amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
         been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make such deductions, (iii)
         such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
         taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
         Laws, and (iv) within thirty (30) days after the date of such payment,
         such Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which
         shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy
         of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all
         present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other
         excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from
         any payment made under any Credit Document or from the execution,
         delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise
         with respect to, any Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other
         Taxes").

                  (c)      If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay
         any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under
         any Credit Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the
         Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent or to such Lender,
         as the case may be, at the time interest is paid, such additional
         amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender specifies is
         necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
         taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes
         or Other Taxes had not been imposed.

                  (d)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative
         Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
         (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any
         jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the
         Administrative Agent and such Lender with respect to amounts received
         under any Credit Document, (ii) amounts payable under Section 3.1(c)
         and (iii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties,
         interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto;
         provided, that the Borrower shall not be required to reimburse the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender in respect of interest, penalties
         or additions to tax attributable to Taxes if such interest, penalties
         or additions to tax are attributable to the gross negligence or willful
         misconduct of the Person seeking reimbursement. Payment under this
         subsection (d) shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date the
         Lender or the Administrative Agent makes demand therefor.

                                       57

<PAGE>

                  (e)      If any Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
         that it has actually received any refund of Taxes in connection with
         any deduction or withholding or payment of any additional amount by the
         Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.1, such Person shall reimburse the
         Borrower in an amount equal to such refund, on an after-tax basis and
         net of all expenses incurred by such Person in connection with
         obtaining such refund. The Borrower shall return such amount to the
         applicable Person in the event that such Person is required to repay
         such refund of Taxes. Nothing contained in this Section 3.1(e) shall
         interfere with the right of any Lender to arrange its tax affairs in
         whatever manner it deems fit or require such Person to disclose any
         information or any computations relating to its tax affairs.

         3.2      ILLEGALITY.

         If any Lender reasonably determines that as a result of any Law that
becomes effective on or after the Closing Date, or any change on or after the
Closing Date in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case that is
applicable to or binding up on such Lender, has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent,
any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such
Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), prepay or convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such
Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate
Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation
will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of
such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

         3.3      INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES.

         If the Required Lenders reasonably determine that by reason of
circumstances arising after the Closing Date adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period
with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for
any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan
does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such
Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each
Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the
instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Borrower may revoke without premium or penalty any pending request
for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Borrowing of

                                       58

<PAGE>

Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and any outstanding Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall be converted on the last day of the then current Interest
Period to Base Rate Loans.

         3.4      INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY; RESERVES
                  ON EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

                  (a)      If any Lender reasonably determines that as a result
         of any Law that becomes effective on or after the Closing Date, or any
         change on or after the Closing Date in or in the interpretation of any
         Law, in each case that is applicable to or binding upon such Lender, or
         such Lender's compliance therewith on or after the Closing Date, there
         shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender (by an amount deemed
         material by such Lender) of agreeing to make or making, funding or
         maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or
         participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount
         received or receivable by such Lender (by an amount deemed material by
         such Lender) in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for
         purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction
         in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section
         3.1 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net
         income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign
         jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the
         Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and
         (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.4(c)), then from
         time to time within twenty (20) days of written demand by such Lender
         (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to
         such Lender, subject to Section 3.6(a), such additional amounts as will
         compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

                  (b)      If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law
         regarding capital adequacy that becomes effective on or after the
         Closing Date, or any change on or after the Closing Date in any Law
         regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation thereof, in each
         case that is applicable to or binding upon such Lender, or compliance
         by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith on or after the
         Closing Date, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
         capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender (by
         an amount deemed material by such Lender) as a consequence of such
         Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies
         with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on
         capital) below that which such Lender or corporation could have
         achieved by for such effectiveness, change or compliance, then from
         time to time within twenty (20) days of written demand by such Lender
         (which demand such Lender shall deliver a copy of to the Administrative
         Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, subject to Section
         3.6(a), such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
         reduction.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as
         such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to
         liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or
         deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional
         interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan
         equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by
         such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which
         determination shall be conclusive absent manifest

                                       59

<PAGE>

         error), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest
         is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at
         least fifteen (15) days' prior notice (with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If
         a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant
         Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and
         payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.

         3.5      FUNDING LOSSES.

         Within twenty (20) days of written demand by any Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly
compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or
expense incurred by it as a result of:

                  (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment
         of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than
         the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to borrow, continue or
         convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the
         amount notified by the Borrower; or

                  (c)      any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan due to any
         assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day
         of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
         Borrower pursuant to Section 11.16.

The compensation payable under this Section 3.5 to any applicable Lender shall
be equal to (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so
prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the
date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrower, convert or continue to
the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on
the date of such failure), in each case at the applicable rate of interest for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan provided for herein (excluding, however, the
Applicable Percentage included therein) minus (ii) the amount of interest (as
reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on
such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with
leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. The Borrower shall also pay
any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the
foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

         3.6      MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

                  (a)      Any request for compensation under this Section 3
         shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Administrative Agent or
         any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3 setting forth the
         additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (and, in
         reasonable detail, the calculation thereof and/or the basis thereof, to
         the extent applicable). Any such certificate shall be conclusive in the
         absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging
         and attribution methods.

                  (b)      Upon (i) any Lender making a claim for compensation
         under Section 3.1 or 3.4 (or the Borrower being required to pay an
         additional amount to any Lender or Governmental Authority for the
         account of any Lender under Section 3.4), (ii) any Lender giving notice
         under Section 3.2 of its inability to make, fund or maintain Eurodollar
         Rate Loans, to the extent only such Lender is unable to make, fund or
         maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans at such time, (iii) any Lender not
         making its ratable share of a Loan borrowing available or any Lender
         failing to participate in L/C Obligations or (iv) any Lender becoming
         and continuing as a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may replace such
         Lender in accordance with Section 11.16.

                  (c)      If any Credit Party is required to pay additional
         amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1 or
         Section 3.4, then such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to
         change the jurisdiction of its applicable Lending Office so as to
         eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter
         accrue if such change, in the good faith, reasonable judgment of such
         Lender, is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (d)      The Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify or
         reimburse the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any amounts
         pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.4 for periods occurring prior to the 180th
         day before the giving of written demand for compensation of such
         amounts by the Administrative Agent or such Lender.

         3.7      SURVIVAL.

         All of the Borrower's obligations under this Section 3 shall survive
termination of the Commitments and repayment of all other Credit Party
Obligations hereunder.

                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1      GUARANTY OF PAYMENT.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Secured Swap Contract, and
the Administrative Agent as

                                       61

<PAGE>

hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment
of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as
a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization
or otherwise, giving effect to any applicable grace periods) strictly in
accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if
any of the Credit Party Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise, giving effect to any applicable grace periods),
the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any
demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same will be
promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise,
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) in accordance with the terms of
such extension or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Secured Swap Contracts, the obligations of
each Guarantor under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall
be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not
render such obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws or any
comparable provisions of any applicable state Law.

         4.2      CREDIT PARTY OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Secured
Swap Contracts, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall
have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against
the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until
such time as the Credit Party Obligations (other than contingent indemnity
obligations which by the terms thereof are stated to survive termination of the
Credit Documents) have been Fully Satisfied. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be
forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to
have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in
Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents and that the

payments made hereunder, each Credit Party shall have contribution rights
against the other Credit Parties as permitted under applicable Law. Such
contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the
Credit Party Obligations and no Credit Party shall exercise such rights of
contribution until all Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full and the
Commitments terminated.

         4.7      GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The Guaranty in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party

         5.2      CONDITIONS TO ALL EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT.

         In addition to the conditions precedent stated elsewhere herein, the
Lenders shall not be obligated to make Loans nor shall the L/C Issuer be
required to issue or extend a Letter of Credit unless:

                  (a)      Notice. The Administrative Agent and, if applicable,
         the L/C Issuer shall have received a Request for Credit Extension in
         accordance with the requirements hereof.

                  (b)      Representations and Warranties. The representations
         and warranties made by the Credit Parties in any Credit Document are
         true and correct in all material respects at and as if made as of such
         date except to the extent they expressly relate to an earlier date.

                  (c)      No Default. No Default or Event of Default shall
         exist or be continuing either prior to or after giving effect thereto;
         provided, however, that the existence of any Default or Event of
         Default resulting from the failure of the Borrower to timely make a
         payment under the Construction Loan Documents shall not, in and of
         itself, constitute a failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
         this subsection (c) in connection with a requested Revolving Loan the
         proceeds of which are to be applied to make such payment under the
         Construction Loan Documents on behalf of the Borrower in accordance
         with the terms of Section 2.2(b).

                  (d)      No Material Adverse Effect. There shall not have
         occurred any Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2002.

                  (e)      Availability. Immediately after giving effect to the
         making of a Loan (and the application of the proceeds thereof) or to
         the issuance of a Letter of Credit, as the case may be, the Total
         Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments.

The delivery of each Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice
requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans) shall constitute a representation and warranty by the
Borrower of the correctness of the matters specified in subsections (b), (c),
(d) and (e) above.

                                    SECTION 6

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Credit Parties hereby represent to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender that:

         fiscal years 2000 and 2001 and

                                       69

<PAGE>

         (ii) the Parent and its Subsidiaries for fiscal year 2002 have
         heretofore been furnished to each Lender. Such financial statements
         (including the notes thereto) (i) have been audited by

         consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby and (iii)
         present fairly (on the basis disclosed in the footnotes to such
         financial statements) the consolidated financial condition, results of
         operations and cash flows of the Credit Parties covered by such
         financial statements as of such date and for such periods. The
         unaudited interim consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of the
         Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the end of, and the related unaudited
         interim consolidated and consolidating statements of earnings and of

         heretofore been furnished to each Lender. Such interim financial
         statements for each such quarterly period, (A) have been prepared in
         accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods
         covered thereby and (B) present fairly (on the basis disclosed in the
         footnotes to such financial statements) the consolidated and
         consolidating financial condition, results of operations and cash flows

         periods, subject to normal year end audit adjustments. During the
         period from June 30, 2003 to and including the Closing Date, there has
         been no sale, transfer or other disposition by the Parent or any of its
         Subsidiaries of any material part of the business or property of the
         Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and no purchase or other
         acquisition by any of them of any business or property (including any
         Capital Stock of any other Person) material in relation to the
         consolidated financial condition of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
         taken as a whole, in each case, which is not reflected in the foregoing
         financial statements or in the notes thereto and has not otherwise been
         disclosed in writing to the Lenders on or prior to the Closing Date.

                  (b)      The financial statements delivered to the Lenders
         pursuant to Section 7.1(a) and (b), (i) have been prepared in
         accordance with GAAP and (ii) present fairly (on the basis disclosed in
         the footnotes to such financial statements) the consolidated financial
         condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Parent and its
         Subsidiaries as of such date and for such periods, except in the case
         of financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(b), subject
         to normal year end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes.

         6.2      NO MATERIAL CHANGE.

         Since December 31, 2002, there has been no development or event
relating to or affecting a Credit Party which has had or would be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.3      ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

         Each Credit Party (a) is a corporation or limited liability company or
other legal entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State (or other jurisdiction) of its
incorporation or organization, (b) is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign organization and authorized to do business in every jurisdiction where
the failure to be so qualified, in good standing or authorized would have a
Material Adverse Effect and (c) has the requisite organizational power and
authority to own its Properties and to carry on its business as now conducted

contemplated in or created in connection with the Credit Documents) upon or with
respect to its Properties.

         6.6      CONSENTS.

         Except for consents, approvals and authorizations and orders, filings,
registrations and qualifications (a) which have been obtained or made, (b) as

         6.14     ERISA.

         Except as would not result or be reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect:

                  (a)      During the five-year period prior to the date on
         which this representation is made or deemed made: (i) no Termination
         Event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of the Credit Parties, no
         event or condition has occurred or exists as a result of which any
         Termination Event could reasonably be expected to occur, with respect
         to any Plan; (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is
         defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or
         not waived, has occurred with respect to any Plan; (iii) each Plan has
         been maintained, operated, and funded in compliance with its own terms
         and in material compliance with the provisions of ERISA, the Code, and
         any other applicable federal or state Laws; and (iv) no lien in favor
         of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen or is reasonably likely to arise on
         account of any Plan.

                  (b)      The actuarial present value of all "benefit
         liabilities" under each Single Employer Plan (determined within the
         meaning of Section 401(a)(2) of the Code, utilizing the actuarial
         assumptions used to fund such Plans), whether or not vested, did not,
         as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
         representation is made or deemed made, exceed the current value of the
         assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued liabilities.

                  (c)      Neither a Credit Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has
         incurred, or, to the knowledge of the Credit Parties, are reasonably
         expected to incur, any withdrawal liability under ERISA to any
         Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. Neither the Borrower, any
         of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any
         notification that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within
         the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), is insolvent (within the meaning
         of Section 4245 of ERISA), or has been terminated (within the meaning
         of Title IV of ERISA), and no Multiemployer Plan is, to the best
         knowledge of the Credit Parties, reasonably expected to be in
         reorganization, insolvent, or terminated.

                  (d)      No prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
         Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of
         fiduciary responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which has
         subjected or is reasonably likely to subject any Credit Party or any
         ERISA Affiliate to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or
         502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or
         other instrument pursuant to which any Credit Party or any ERISA
         Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify any person against any
         such liability.

                  (e)      The present value (determined using actuarial and
         other assumptions which are reasonable with respect to the benefits
         provided and the employees participating) of the liability of each
         Credit Party and each ERISA Affiliate for post-retirement welfare
         benefits to be provided to their current and former employees under
         Plans which are welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of
         ERISA), net of all assets under all such Plans allocable to such
         benefits, are reflected on the most recent audited financial statements
         of the Parent

                                       73

<PAGE>

         and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to Section 5.1(l) or Section
         7.1(a) in accordance with FASB 106.

                  (f)      Each Plan which is a welfare plan (as defined in
         Section 3(1) of ERISA) to which Sections 601-609 of ERISA and Section
         4980B of the Code apply has been administered in material compliance
         with such sections.

         6.15     SUBSIDIARIES AS OF THE CLOSING DATE.

         Set forth on Schedule 6.15 is a complete and accurate list as of the
Closing Date of all Subsidiaries of each Credit Party. Information on Schedule
6.15 includes as of the Closing Date jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, the number of shares of each class of Capital Stock outstanding,
the number and percentage of outstanding shares of each class owned (directly or
indirectly) by such Credit Party; and the number and effect, if exercised, of
all outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion or purchase and all
other similar rights with respect thereto as of the Closing Date. The
outstanding Capital Stock of all such Subsidiaries is (to the extent applicable)
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is, to the extent owned by
each such Credit Party, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens and than those arising under or contemplated in
connection with the Credit Documents). Other than as set forth in Schedule 6.15,
as of the Closing Date neither any Credit Party nor any Subsidiary thereof has
outstanding any securities convertible into or exchangeable for its Capital
Stock nor does any such Person have outstanding any rights to subscribe for or
to purchase, or any options for the purchase of, or any agreements providing for
the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims
of any character relating to, its Capital Stock. As of the Closing Date, none of
the Credit Parties owns any shares of Capital Stock in any Foreign Subsidiaries.

         6.16     USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The proceeds of the Loans hereunder will be used solely for the
purposes specified in Section 7.10. No proceeds of the Loans hereunder have been
or will be used (a) to acquire, directly or indirectly, any security in any
transaction which is subject to Sections 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act
(including, without limitation, Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof) or to
refinance any Indebtedness used to acquire any such securities or (b) for the
Acquisition of another Person unless such Acquisition is a Permitted
Acquisition.

         6.17     GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

                  (a)      No part of the Letters of Credit or proceeds of the
         Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, (i) for the purpose of
         purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" within the meaning of
         Regulation U, or (ii) for the purpose of purchasing or carrying or
         trading in any securities if, as a result thereof, the Administrative
         Agent would be required to take any action under Regulation T. If
         requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will
         furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the
         foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1
         referred to in Regulation U. No Indebtedness being reduced or retired
         out of the proceeds of the Loans was or will be incurred for the
         purpose of purchasing or

                                       74

<PAGE>

         carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U or any
         "margin security" within the meaning of Regulation T. "Margin stock"
         within the meaning of Regulation U does not constitute more than 25% of
         the value of the consolidated assets of the Credit Parties. None of the
         transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents (including, without
         limitation, the direct or indirect use of the proceeds of the Loans)
         will violate or result in a violation of the Securities Act, the
         Exchange Act, regulations issued pursuant to the Securities Act or the
         Exchange Act, or Regulation T, U or X.

                  (b)      No Credit Party is subject to regulation under the
         Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or
         the Investment Company Act of 1940, each as amended. In addition, no
         Credit Party is (i) an "investment company" registered or required to
         be registered as such under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
         amended, and, to the best of its knowledge, is not controlled (as such
         term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) by
         such a company, or (ii) a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company"
         of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of
         a "subsidiary" of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public
         Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         6.18     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

         to cause a Material Adverse Effect:

                  operations at the Real Properties are in compliance with all
                  applicable Environmental Laws, and there is no violation of
                  any Environmental Law with respect to the Real Properties or
                  the businesses operated by the Credit Parties (the
                  "Businesses").

                           (ii)     No Credit Party has received any written
                  notice of, or inquiry from any Governmental Authority
                  regarding, any violation, alleged violation, non-compliance,
                  liability or potential liability regarding Hazardous Materials
                  or compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of
                  the Real Properties or the Businesses.

                           (iii)    Hazardous Materials have not been
                  transported or disposed of from the Real Properties, or

                  of the Real Properties or any other location, in each case by,
                  or on behalf or with the permission of, a Credit Party in a
                  manner that would give rise to liability under any applicable
                  Environmental Laws.

                           (iv)     No judicial proceeding or governmental or
                  administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of a
                  Credit Party, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which
                  a Credit Party is a party, nor are there any consent decrees
                  or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or
                  other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements
                  outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to a
                  Credit Party, the Real Properties or the Businesses.

                           (v)      There has been no release (including,
                  without limitation, disposal) or threat of release of

                  from or related to the operations of a Credit Party in
                  connection with the Real Properties or otherwise in connection
                  with the Businesses, in violation of or in amounts or in a
                  manner that could give rise to liability under Environmental
                  Laws.

                           (vi)     To the knowledge of the Credit Parties, no
                  Credit Party has assumed any liability of any Person (other
                  than another Credit Party) under any Environmental Law.

                  (b)      Each Credit Party has adopted procedures that are
         designed to (i) ensure that such Credit Party, any of its operations

                  or the Required Lenders reasonably believe has caused (or
                  could be reasonably expected to cause) the representations and
                  warranties set forth in Section 6.18 to be untrue in any
                  material respect, the Borrower will furnish or cause to be

                  operated by a Credit Party and as to the compliance by the
                  Credit Parties with Environmental Laws. If the Borrower fails
                  to deliver such an environmental report within seventy-five
                  (75) days after receipt of such written request, then the
                  Administrative Agent may arrange for same, and the Credit
                  Parties hereby grant to the Administrative Agent and its
                  representatives access to the Real Properties and a license of
                  a scope reasonably necessary to undertake such an assessment
                  (including, where appropriate, invasive soil or groundwater
                  sampling). The reasonable cost of any assessment arranged for
                  by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this provision will be
                  payable by the Borrower on demand and added to the Credit
                  Party Obligations.

                           (ii)     Each Credit Party will conduct and complete
                  all investigations, studies, sampling, and testing and all
                  remedial, removal, and other actions reasonably necessary with
                  respect to all Hazardous Materials on, from, or affecting any
                  real property owned or leased by a Credit Party to the extent
                  necessary to be in compliance with all Environmental Laws and
                  all other applicable federal, state, and local Laws and with
                  the orders and directives of all Governmental Authorities
                  exercising jurisdiction over such real property to the extent
                  any failure to do so would cause or be reasonably expected to
                  cause a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (l)      Tax Shelter Determination. Promptly after any Credit
         Party has notified the Administrative Agent of any intention by such
         Credit Party to treat the Loans and/or the Letters of Credit and
         related transactions as being a "reportable transaction" (within the
         meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4), a duly completed copy
         of IRS Form 8886 or any successor form.

                  (m)      Other Information. With reasonable promptness upon
         any such request, such other information regarding the business,
         Properties or financial condition of the Credit Parties and their
         Subsidiaries as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may

         7.3      PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE AND FRANCHISES.

         Each of the Credit Parties will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, do all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and
effect its existence, rights, franchises and authority except as permitted by
Section 8.4 or Section 8.5 or unless any such Person determines that any such
rights, franchises or authority is no longer necessary to the conduct of its
business or unless the failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect any
such right, franchise and authority would not have or would not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.4      BOOKS AND RECORDS.

         Each of the Credit Parties will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, keep complete and accurate books and records of its
transactions to allow preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP (including the establishment and maintenance of appropriate reserves).

                                       83

<PAGE>

         7.5      COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         Each of the Credit Parties will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, comply with all Laws and all restrictions imposed by
Governmental Authorities applicable to it and its property (including, without
limitation, Environmental Laws and ERISA) if non-compliance with any such Law or
restriction would have or would be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         7.6      PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS.

         Each of the Credit Parties will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, pay, settle or discharge (a) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges or levies imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits,
or upon any of its Properties, before they shall become delinquent and (b) all
lawful claims (including claims for labor, materials and supplies) which, if
unpaid, might give rise to a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any of its
Properties; provided, however, that a Credit Party or its Subsidiary shall not
be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim which is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
adequate reserves therefor have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless
the failure to make any such payment (i) would give rise to an immediate right
to foreclose or collect on a Lien securing such amounts or (ii) would have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.7      INSURANCE.

                  (a)      Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain in full force and effect
         insurance (including worker's compensation insurance, liability
         insurance, casualty insurance and business interruption insurance) in
         such amounts, covering such risks and liabilities and with such
         deductibles or self-insurance retentions as are in accordance with
         normal industry practice (or as otherwise required by the Collateral
         Documents). The Administrative Agent shall be named as loss payee or
         mortgagee, as its interest may appear, and/or additional insured with
         respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect of any
         Collateral, and each provider of any such insurance shall agree, by
         endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by independent
         instruments furnished to the Administrative Agent, that it will give
         the Administrative Agent thirty (30) days prior written notice before
         any such policy or policies shall be altered or canceled, and that no
         act or default of any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any
         other Person shall affect the rights of the Administrative Agent or the
         Lenders under such policy or policies. The present insurance coverage
         of the Credit Parties is outlined as to carrier, policy number,
         expiration date, type and amount on Schedule 7.7.

                  (b)      In case of any material loss of, damage to or
         destruction of any Collateral, such Credit Party (i) shall promptly
         give written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent generally
         describing the nature and extent of such damage or destruction, (ii) in
         the event that such Credit Party receives insurance proceeds on account
         of any such loss of, damage to or destruction of such Collateral in a
         net amount in excess of $1,000,000 (in respect of any insurance event,
         the "Excess Proceeds"), such Credit Party will immediately pay over
         such Excess Proceeds to the Administrative Agent as cash collateral for
         the Credit Party

                                       84

<PAGE>

         Obligations and (iii) whether or not the insurance proceeds, if any,
         received on account of such damage or destruction shall be sufficient
         for that purpose, at such Credit Party's cost and expense, will
         promptly repair or replace the Collateral of such Credit Party so lost,
         damaged or destroyed; provided, however, that (A) such Credit Party
         need not repair or replace the Collateral of such Credit Party so lost,
         damaged or destroyed to the extent the failure to make such repair or
         replacement (1) is desirable to the proper conduct of the business of
         such Credit Party in the ordinary course and otherwise in the best
         interest of such Credit Party and (2) would not materially impair the
         rights and benefits of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under
         the Collateral Documents, any other Credit Document or any Swap
         Contract and (B) in the event that such Credit Party receives insurance
         proceeds on account of any such loss of, damage to or destruction of
         Collateral in a net amount in excess of $1,000,000, such Credit Party
         shall not undertake replacement or restoration of any lost, damaged or
         destroyed Collateral of such Credit Party with insurance proceeds in
         respect thereof unless the Administrative Agent has received evidence
         reasonably satisfactory to it that the Collateral lost, damaged or
         destroyed has been or will be replaced or restored to its condition
         immediately prior to such loss, destruction or other event giving rise
         to the payment of such insurance proceeds; provided, further, however,
         if such Credit Party elects not to repair or replace any lost, damaged
         or destroyed Collateral in accordance with clause (A) above or is not
         permitted to repair or replace such lost, damaged or destroyed
         Collateral pursuant to clause (B) above, such Credit Party may apply
         any related insurance proceeds to an Eligible Reinvestment.

                  (c)      With respect to any Excess Proceeds deposited with
         the Administrative Agent by any Credit Party as provided in the
         subsection (b) above, the Administrative Agent agrees to release such
         Excess Proceeds to such Credit Party for replacement or restoration of
         the portion of the Collateral of such Credit Party lost, damaged or
         destroyed or, subject to the terms of such subsection (b), to make an
         Eligible Reinvestment; provided that, within ninety (90) days from the
         date that the Administrative Agent receives such Excess Proceeds, the
         Administrative Agent shall have received a written application for
         release of such Excess Proceeds from such Credit Party establishing
         satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clause (B) of subsection
         (b) above or that, subject to the terms of such subsection (b), such
         Credit Party plans to apply such proceeds to make an Eligible
         Reinvestment.

                  (d)      Any insurance proceeds received by any Credit Party
         on account of any such loss of, damage to or destruction of Collateral
         that (i) are not applied pursuant to subsection (b) above within the
         period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the date the
         applicable Credit Party receives such proceeds to repair or replace the
         Collateral or, subject to the terms of such subsection (b), to make an
         Eligible Reinvestment, (ii) are not permitted to be applied pursuant to
         clause (B) of such subsection (b) to repair or replace the Collateral
         and are not otherwise applied to make an Eligible Reinvestment in
         accordance with the terms of such subsection (b) within the period of
         one hundred eight (180) days following the date the applicable Credit
         Party receives such proceeds or (iii) constitute Excess Proceeds which
         have been deposited with the Administrative Agent and with respect to
         which the conditions for application to replacement or restoration or
         for making an Eligible Reinvestment or for release set forth in
         subsection (c) above shall not have been met on or before the first
         Business Day following the date ninety (90) days from the date the

                                       85

<PAGE>
         Administrative Agent receives such Excess Proceeds, shall be applied
         (by the Credit Parties or, in the case of Excess Proceeds held by the
         Administrative Agent, by the Administrative Agent) to prepay the Loans
         (and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations) in accordance with the
         terms of Section 2.4(b)(iii)(B).

                  (e)      All insurance proceeds shall, to the extent set forth
         in the Collateral Documents, be subject to the security interest of the
         Administrative Agent (for the ratable of the Lenders) under the
         Collateral Documents.

         7.8      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY.

         Each of the Credit Parties will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain and preserve its Properties and equipment material to
the conduct of its business in good repair, working order and condition, normal
wear and tear excepted, and will make, or cause to be made, in such Properties
and equipment from time to time all repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions,
additions, betterments and improvements thereto as may be needed or proper, to
the extent and in the manner customary for companies in similar businesses
unless any such Credit Party determines any such Properties or equipment are no
longer necessary to the conduct of its business.

         7.9      COLLATERAL.

         If, subsequent to the Closing Date, a Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries shall (a) (i) acquire any Property, any Intellectual Property which
is the subject of any application or registration or any securities, in each
case required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent as Collateral
hereunder or under any of the Collateral Documents or (ii) enter into any lease
agreement with respect to any plant, warehouse or other material real property
that is not part of the Real Properties as of the Closing Date, the Borrower
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of same, or (b) enter into any
lease agreement with respect to any real property (other than an office
location) not covered by clause (a)(ii) above, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of same within ninety (90) days of entering into such lease
agreement. Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
take such action (including, but not limited to, the actions similar in scope to
those set forth in Sections 5.1(d) and (e) and Section 7.12), as reasonably
requested by the Administrative Agent and at its own expense, to ensure that the
Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) has a perfected Lien in all
owned real property and such personal property of the Credit Parties and their
Subsidiaries as and to the extent set forth in the Collateral Documents (whether
now owned or hereafter acquired), subject only to Permitted Liens. Each Credit
Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, adhere to the covenants
regarding changing its legal name or state of incorporation or organization as
set forth in the Security Agreement.

         7.10     USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The Credit Parties will, and will cause their Subsidiaries to, use the
proceeds of the Loans solely (a) to refinance indebtedness under the Existing
Credit Agreement, (b) to repay certain existing Indebtedness of the Credit
Parties and their Subsidiaries as set forth on Schedule 7.10, (c) to pay fees
and expenses as required by or incurred in connection with this Credit
Agreement, (d) to provide working capital for the Credit Parties and their
Subsidiaries, (e) for capital expenditures,

<PAGE>

(f) to make any payment when due under the Construction Loan Documents in
accordance with Section 2.2(b) and (g) for general corporate purposes of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The Credit Parties will use the Letters of Credit
solely for the purposes set forth in Section 2.3(a).

         7.11     AUDITS/INSPECTIONS.

         Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, each Credit
Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit representatives
appointed by the Administrative Agent, including, without limitation,
independent accountants, agents, attorneys and appraisers to visit and inspect
such Person's property, including its books and records, its accounts receivable
and inventory, its facilities and its other business assets, and to make
photocopies or photographs thereof and to write down and record any information
such representative obtains and shall permit the Administrative Agent, the
Required Lenders or their representatives to investigate and verify the accuracy
of information provided to the Lenders, and to discuss all such matters with the
officers, employees and representatives of the Credit Parties; provided that (a)
the Administrative Agent and its representatives shall not be entitled to review
and make photocopies or photographs of any document (or portion of any document)
that the disclosure of which to the Administrative Agent and its representatives
would constitute a breach by the applicable Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries of a confidentiality or similar agreement entered into, or
confidential terms agreed to (to the extent such confidentiality or similar
agreement or confidential terms were not entered into or agreed to solely in
order to avoid disclosing such document to the Administrative Agent and its
representatives), by such Credit Party or such Subsidiary with respect to such
document (or portion thereof) and (b) the Borrower shall have the right to be
present during any discussion, conversation or meeting with any accountant of
any Credit Party. The Credit Parties agree that the Administrative Agent and its
representatives may conduct an annual audit of the Collateral (or may audit the
Collateral at any time during the existence of an Event of Default), at the
expense of the Borrower.

         7.12     ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARIES.

         At the time any Person becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of a
Credit Party, the Borrower shall so notify the Administrative Agent and promptly
thereafter (but in any event within sixty (60) days after the date thereof) the
Credit Parties shall cause such Person to (a) execute a Joinder Agreement in
substantially the same form as Exhibit F, (b) cause all of the Capital Stock (if
any) of such Person to be delivered to the Administrative Agent (together with
undated stock powers signed in blank) and pledged to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to a pledge agreement in substantially the form of the Pledge Agreement
(or a joinder to the existing Pledge Agreement) or otherwise in a form

appropriate real estate collateral documentation, and deliver such title
policies, surveys, environmental reports, flood hazard reports and other
documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, in each case
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (f) if such Person
leases (i) any plant, warehouse or other material real property, to the extent
required by the Administrative Agent, (A) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the applicable landlord's consent to grant the Administrative
Agent a mortgage Lien on its leasehold interest in such plant warehouse or other
material property and (B) to the extent such landlord's consent is obtained,
execute any and all necessary leasehold mortgages, leasehold deeds of trust,
leasehold deeds to secure debt or other appropriate real estate collateral
documentation, and deliver such title policies, surveys, environmental reports,
flood hazard reports and other documentation as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request, in each case in a form acceptable to the Administrative
Agent, or (ii) any other real property (other than an office location), use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Administrative
Agent a landlord waiver or estoppel letter with respect thereto in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and (g) deliver such other
documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing, including, without limitation, appropriate UCC-1 financing
statements, real estate title insurance policies, environmental reports,
certified resolutions and other organizational and authorizing documents of such
Person and favorable opinions of counsel to such Person (which shall cover,
among other things, the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability of
the documentation referred to above), all in form, content and scope reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         of time as agreed to by the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall
         deliver to the Administrative Agent a letter agreement executed by the
         parties to the Baxter Springs Intercreditor Agreement, which letter

         replacements or extensions thereof on terms and conditions no less
         favorable, in the aggregate, to the Parent or such Subsidiary, as

         not in excess of that outstanding as of the date of such amendment,
         restatement, supplement, refunding, renewal, refinancing, replacement
         or extension;

         Effect: (A) any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is
         defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or
         not waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any lien shall
         arise on the assets of any Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate in favor
         of the PBGC or a Plan; (B) a Termination Event shall occur with respect
         to a Single Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the
         Administrative Agent, likely to result in the termination of such Plan
         for purposes of Title IV of ERISA; (C) a Termination Event shall occur
         with respect to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, which
         is, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, likely to
         result in (i) the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of
         ERISA, or (ii) any Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any
         liability in connection with a withdrawal from, reorganization of
         (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or insolvency (within
         the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA) of such Plan; or (D) any
         prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
         Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of fiduciary responsibility shall
         occur which may subject any Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate to any
         liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or
         Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other instrument
         pursuant to which any Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or
         is required to indemnify any person against any such liability.

                  (j)      Ownership. There shall occur a Change of Control.

                  (k)      Classification as Senior Indebtedness. The Credit
         Party Obligations shall at any time fail to constitute "Senior
         Indebtedness" under and as defined in any agreement governing any
         outstanding Subordinated Indebtedness.

         9.2      ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the Administrative Agent shall, upon the request and direction of the
Required Lenders, by written notice to the Borrower, take the following actions
without prejudice to the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
enforce its claims against the Credit Parties, except as otherwise specifically
provided for herein:

                  (a)      Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments
         terminated whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b)      Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal
         of and any accrued interest in respect of all Loans, all L/C
         Obligations and any and all other Credit Party Obligations of any and
         every kind owing by a Credit Party to any of the Lenders hereunder to
         be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable without
         presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
         are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

                  (c)      Cash Collateral. Direct the Borrower to pay (and the
         Borrower agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or upon the
         occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event, it will immediately pay) to the
         Administrative Agent Cash Collateral to be held by the Administrative
         Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in a cash collateral account as
         additional security for the L/C Obligations in respect of subsequent
         drawings under all then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount
         equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn under all
         Letters of Credits then outstanding.

                  (d)      Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
         interests created and existing under the Credit Documents and any and
         all rights under applicable Laws, including, without limitation, all
         rights and remedies existing under the Collateral Documents, all rights
         and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of set-off.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur, then the
Commitments shall automatically terminate and all Loans, all L/C Obligations,
all accrued interest in respect thereof, all accrued and unpaid fees and other
Credit Party Obligations owing to the Lenders hereunder and under the other
Credit Documents shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of
any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, which
notice or other action is expressly waived by the Credit Parties.

Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside primarily with the
Administrative Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by Law, a
separate right of payment and shall be

                                       98
<PAGE>

considered a separate "creditor" holding a separate "claim" within the meaning
of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other insolvency statute.

         9.3      ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after
the exercise of remedies by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders pursuant to
Section 9.2 (or after the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the
Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts under the Credit
Documents (including without limitation the maximum amount of all contingent
liabilities under Letters of Credit) shall automatically become due and payable
in accordance with the terms of such Section), all amounts collected or received
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of amounts outstanding
under any of the Credit Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid
over or delivered as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out - of - pocket
         costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable Attorney
         Costs) of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders in connection
         with enforcing the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
         under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the
         Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders with respect to the
         Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees, indemnities, expenses and
         other amounts (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under
         Section 3) owed to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any
         Lender;

                  THIRD, to payment of that portion of the Credit Party
         Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and
         L/C Borrowings, and including with respect to any Secured Swap
         Contract, any fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments due under
         such Secured Swap Contract, ratably among the Lenders (and any
         Affiliate of a Lender party to a Secured Swap Contract) as set forth
         below;

                  FOURTH, to payment of that portion of the Credit Party
         Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans, L/C Borrowings
         and any breakage, termination or other payments pursuant to Secured
         Swap Contracts, and to Cash Collateralize the undrawn amounts of
         Letters of Credit, ratably among the Lenders (and any Affiliate of a
         Lender party to a Secured Swap Contract) as set forth below; and

                  FIFTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category; (b) each of the Lenders (and Affiliates of Lenders party to
Secured Swap Contracts) shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share
(based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans, L/C Obligations and
net payment obligations under Secured Swap Contracts held by such Lender bears
to the aggregate then outstanding Loans, L/C Obligations and obligations under
Secured Swap Contracts) of amounts

                                       99
<PAGE>

available to be applied; and (c) to the extent that any amounts available for
distribution pursuant to clause "FOURTH" above are attributable to the issued
but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held
by the Administrative Agent as Cash Collateral and applied (i) first, to
reimburse the L/C Issuer or, to the extent participated to the Lenders, the
Lenders from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (ii)
then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other
obligations of the types described in clause "FOURTH" above in the manner
provided in this Section 9.3.

                                   SECTION 10

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         10.1     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  (a)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates
         and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its
         behalf under the provisions of this Credit Agreement and each other
         Credit Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as
         are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Credit Agreement or
         any other Credit Document, together with such powers as are reasonably
         incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
         contained elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, the
         Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
         except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative
         Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
         Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
         responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into
         this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or otherwise exist
         against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of
         the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the
         other Credit Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is
         not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
         obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.
         Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
         intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
         between independent contracting parties.

                  (b)      The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders
         with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents
         associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits
         and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Section
         10 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C
         Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to
         be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of
         credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
         "Administrative Agent" as used in this Section 10 and in the definition
         of "Agent - Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to
         such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with
         respect to the L/C Issuer.

                                      100

         10.2     DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys - in - fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other
consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agent or attorney - in - fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

         10.3     LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         No Agent - Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated hereby
(except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any
other Credit Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document,
or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or for any failure of any
Credit Party or any other party to any Credit Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent - Related Person shall be under
any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the
Properties, books or records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

         10.4     RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
         and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
         communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent,
         certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone
         message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or
         conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
         have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and
         upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any
         Credit Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by
         the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
         justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Credit
         Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
         the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it
         shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against
         any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
         of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative
         Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
         from acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or
         such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in
         any instance) and

                                      101
<PAGE>

         such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
         shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

                  (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the
         conditions specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this
         Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or
         accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter
         required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
         satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have
         received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
         specifying its objection thereto.

         10.5     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Credit Agreement and specifying and describing the Default that has
occurred. The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any
such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Section 9; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has
received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the
Lenders.

         10.6     CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT.

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent - Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent - Related
Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent - Related Persons
have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents
to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent - Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and
all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Credit
Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent -
Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the
other Credit Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Credit
Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to
be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or

                                      102
<PAGE>

responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent - Related
Person.

         10.7     INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent - Related Person (to the
extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting
the obligation of any Credit Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each
Agent - Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the
payment to any Agent - Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent - Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this
Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out - of
- pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any
document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the
Commitments, the payment of all Credit Party Obligations and the resignation of
the Administrative Agent.

         10.8     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective
Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the
L/C Issuer hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The
Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its
Affiliates may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of such Credit Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the
Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to
them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and
powers under this Credit Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such
rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C
Issuer, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

                                      103
<PAGE>

         10.9     SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty
(30) days' notice to the Lenders; provided that any such resignation by Bank of
America shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer. If the
Administrative Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the Required Lenders
shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the
Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the
Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default
(which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of
the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor
administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as
such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and, unless the Borrower and the
Lenders choose to appoint an L/C Issuer that is different than the
Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and the respective terms "Administrative Agent"
and "L/C Issuer" shall mean such successor administrative agent and Letter of
Credit issuer, and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and
duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated and the retiring L/C Issuer's
rights, powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such retiring L/C Issuer or any other Lender,
other than the obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit
in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of
such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C
Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with
respect to such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10
and Sections 11.4 and 11.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Credit
Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the
Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
administrative agent as provided for above.

         10.10    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise:

                  (a)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Credit Party Obligations that are owing and
         unpaid and to file such other documents as may be

                                      104
<PAGE>

         necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
         compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and
         all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under
         Sections 2.3(i) and (j), 2.8 and 11.4) allowed in such judicial
         proceeding; and

                  (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.8 and 11.4.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Credit Party Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.

         10.11    COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS.

         The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
option and in its discretion,

                  (a)      to release any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document (i) upon
         termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Credit Party
         Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the
         expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is

                  (b)      (i) postpone any date fixed by this Credit Agreement

         substantially all of the other Credit Parties from its or their
         obligations under the Credit Documents without the written consent of
         each Lender;

                  (h)      without the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders
         (other than Defaulting Lenders), waive any Default or Event of Default
         (or amend any provision of any Credit Document that results in any
         outstanding Default or Event of Default being cured or terminated)
         solely for purposes of Section 5.2(c); provided, however, that only the
         consent of the Required Revolving Lenders shall be necessary to waive
         any such outstanding Default or Event of Default solely for purposes of
         Section 5.2(c);

                  (i)      without the consent of Lenders (other than Defaulting
         Lenders) holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the
         outstanding Tranche A Term Loan (and participations therein) and a
         majority of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loan (and participations
         therein), (i) amend, change, waive, discharge or terminate Section 9.3
         so as to alter the manner of application of any payment in respect of
         the Credit Party Obligations or proceeds of Collateral or (ii) amend,
         change, waive, discharge or terminate Section 2.4(c) so as to alter the
         manner of application of proceeds of any mandatory prepayment required
         by Section 2.4(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) hereof, in each case only to
         the extent such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination
         directly affects such Lenders;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of

                                      107
<PAGE>

the L/C Issuer under this Credit Agreement or any Letter of Credit Application
relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement or any
other Credit Document; (iii) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or
privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto;
(iv) a Letter of Credit may be amended in accordance with the terms of Section
2.3(b)(i) and (ii); and (v) the execution of any Joinder Agreement by the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the new Subsidiary or Subsidiaries party
thereto, and any update to the Schedules hereto and to the Collateral Documents
made in accordance with the terms of such Joinder Agreement, shall not require
the approval of any Lender.

         For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Section 11.1, this Credit Agreement may be amended
(or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Credit Parties and the
Required Lenders (x) to increase the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders (by
the addition of new Lenders or increasing the individual Commitments of existing
Lenders that consent thereto), (y) to add one or more additional tranches of
Loans to the Credit Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time
to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect
thereof (collectively, the "Additional Extensions of Credit") to share ratably
in the benefits of this Credit Agreement and other Credit Documents with the
other then outstanding Credit Party Obligations and (z) to include appropriately
the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that no such amendment shall permit the Additional
Extensions of Credit to share ratably with or with preference to the Term Loans
in the application of mandatory prepayments without the consent of Lenders
(other than Defaulting Lenders) holding in the aggregate at least a majority of
the outstanding Tranche A Term Loan (and participations therein) and a majority
of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loan (and participations therein), or
otherwise to share ratably with or with preference to the Revolving Loans
without the consent of the Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding
Revolving Loans.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender
shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent
hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or
extended without the consent of such Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders shall determine whether
or not to allow a Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and such determination shall be binding on
all of the Lenders.

         (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
         any assignment of a Revolving Commitment must be approved by the
         Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer unless the Person that is the
         proposed assignee is itself a Revolving Lender (whether or not the
         proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and
         (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
         Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
         processing and recordation fee of $3,500, with only one such fee
         payable in the case of substantially contemporaneous assignments to
         Approved Funds or Affiliates of a single Lender; provided that such
         processing and recordation fee shall not be required for any assignment
         from a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender and shall not be
         reimbursed by any Credit Party. Subject to acceptance and recording
         thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this
         Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
         and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to
         this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by
         such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
         Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder
         shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Credit
         Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
         all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
         continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 11.4
         and 11.5 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the
         effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its
         expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any
         assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
         Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be
         treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender
         of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
         subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
         purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the
         Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
         delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
         addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts
         of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
         terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the
         Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower,
         the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
         name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a
         Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
         for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
         and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                                      113

                  (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of,
         or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
         participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the
         Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates (other than accounts
         managed by Oak Hill Advisors, Inc. or its Affiliates) or Subsidiaries)
         (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights
         and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a
         portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
         participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such
         Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain
         unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)
         the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
         continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
         with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement.
         Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
         participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
         right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment,
         modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement;
         provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender
         will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
         amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (a), (b)
         and (c) of the first proviso to Section 11.1 that directly affects such
         Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower
         agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
         Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
         had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
         this Section. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also
         shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9 as though it were a
         Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12
         as though it were a Lender.

                  (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
         greater payment under Section 3.1, 3.4 of 3.5 than the applicable
         Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
         participation sold to such Participant, unless the Borrower consents
         otherwise. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
         Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 unless the
         Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and
         such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply
         with Section 11.15 as though it were a Lender.

                  (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
         security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
         Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of
         such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations,
         to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
         shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
         substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
         hereto.

                  (g)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all
         or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by
         it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities
         issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities;
         provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender
         in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 11.7, (i) no
         such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its

                                      114
<PAGE>

         obligations under the Credit Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not
         be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Credit
         Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights
         with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment
         and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon
         thirty (30) days' notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C
         Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the
         Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a
         successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by
         the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation
         of Bank of America as L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as L/C
         Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C
         Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as
         of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C
         Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the
         Lenders to make Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in
         Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.3(c)).

         11.8     CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees
and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Credit Agreement; (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Credit Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant
in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights
or obligations under this Credit Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect
contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual
counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit
derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Credit Parties; (g) with
the consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than a Credit Party and such information from such
source is not, to such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's actual knowledge,
subject to an obligation of confidentiality; or (i) to the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization. In addition, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Credit
Agreement and information about this Credit Agreement to market data collectors,
similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and
management of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the
Commitments, and the Credit Extensions; provided, however, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may not disclose non-

                                      115
<PAGE>

public financial information regarding any Credit Party to such market data
collectors and other service providers. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from any Credit Party relating to
any Credit Party or its business, other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
prior to disclosure by any Credit Party. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, "Information" shall not include, and the
Administrative Agent and each Lender may disclose without limitation of any
kind, any information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure"
(in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011 - 4) of
the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Administrative Agent or
such Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with
respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information
concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as
other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the
document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of
the Loans, Letters of Credit and transactions contemplated hereby.

         11.9     SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each
Lender is authorized, subject to the terms of Section 2.12, at any time and from
time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Credit Party,
any such notice being waived by each Credit Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other
indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender (or any Lender Affiliate, branch
or agent of such Lender) to or for the credit or the account of the respective
Credit Parties against any and all Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender
hereunder or under any other Credit Document, now or hereafter existing,
irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall
have made demand under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document and
although such Credit Party Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or
denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or
indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set - off and application made by such
Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set - off and application. Notwithstanding the foregoing
the parties hereto agree that the Lenders' rights of set off with respect to
Cash Collateral are subject to the rights of the Administrative Agent (on behalf
of the Lenders) with respect to such Cash Collateral pursuant to the terms of
the control or similar agreement related to such account and the other
Collateral Documents.

         11.10    INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Credit
Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Credit Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non - usurious interest permitted by
applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative

                                      116
<PAGE>

Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if
it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining
whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative
Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal
as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Credit Party Obligations hereunder.

         11.11    COUNTERPARTS.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

         11.12    INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS; CONTINUING AGREEMENT.

                  (a)      This Credit Agreement, together with the other Credit
         Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the
         parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all
         prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event
         of any conflict between the provisions of this Credit Agreement and
         those of any other Credit Document, the provisions of this Credit
         Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental
         rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
         in any other Credit Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
         Credit Agreement. Each Credit Document was drafted with the joint
         participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed
         neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
         with the fair meaning thereof.

                  (b)      This Credit Agreement shall become effective at such
         time when all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have been
         satisfied or waived by the Lenders and it shall have been executed by
         the Borrower, the Guarantors and the Administrative Agent, and the
         Administrative Agent shall have received copies hereof (telefaxed or
         otherwise) which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each
         Lender, and thereafter this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and
         inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Guarantors, the
         Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective successors
         and permitted assigns. At such time as this Credit Agreement becomes
         effective pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding sentence,
         the Existing Credit Agreement automatically shall be deemed amended and
         restated in its entirety by this Credit Agreement and the related
         refinancing, and the Credit Parties and the Lenders party to the
         Existing Credit Agreement shall no longer have any obligations
         thereunder (other than those obligations in the Existing Credit
         Agreement that expressly survive the termination thereof).

                  (c)      This Credit Agreement shall be a continuing agreement
         and shall remain in full force and effect until all Loans, L/C
         Obligations, interest, fees and other Credit Party Obligations (other
         than those obligations that expressly survive the termination of this
         Credit Agreement) have been paid in full and all Commitments and
         Letters of Credit have been terminated. Upon termination, the Credit
         Parties shall have no further obligations (other

                                      117
<PAGE>

         than those obligations that expressly survive the termination of this
         Credit Agreement) under the Credit Documents and the Administrative
         Agent shall, at the request and expense of the Borrower, deliver all
         the Collateral in its possession to the Borrower and release all Liens
         on the Collateral; provided that should any payment, in whole or in
         part, of the Credit Party Obligations be rescinded or otherwise
         required to be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any
         Lender, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
         reorganization or otherwise, then the Credit Documents shall
         automatically be reinstated and all Liens of the Administrative Agent
         shall reattach to the Collateral and all amounts required to be
         restored or returned and all costs and expenses incurred by the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection therewith shall be
         deemed included as part of the Credit Party Obligations.

         11.13    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other
Credit Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof
and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied
upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any
investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf
and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Commitment remains
outstanding, any Loan or any other Credit Party Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

         11.14    SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Credit Agreement and the
other Credit Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

                  11.15    TAX FORMS.

                  (a)      (i)      Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the
                  Borrower and the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any
                  payment under any Credit Document (or upon accepting an
                  assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed
                  copies of either IRS Form W - 8BEN or any successor thereto
                  (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to a
                  complete exemption from U.S. withholding tax on all payments
                  to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to
                  this Credit Agreement) or IRS Form W - 8ECI or any successor
                  thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign
                  Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement) or
                  such other evidence

                                      118
<PAGE>

                  satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that
                  such Foreign Lender is entitled to a complete exemption from
                  U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to
                  Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time,
                  each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the
                  Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed
                  copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall
                  be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States
                  taxing authorities) as may then be available under then
                  current United States Laws and regulations to avoid, or such
                  evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or
                  reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of
                  all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower
                  pursuant to this Credit Agreement, (B) promptly notify the
                  Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which
                  would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
                  reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially
                  disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such
                  Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re -
                  designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of
                  applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
                  withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign
                  Lender.

                           (ii)     Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does
                  not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to
                  any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under
                  any of the Credit Documents (for example, in the case of a
                  typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the
                  Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign Lender
                  ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion
                  of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as
                  may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative
                  Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two
                  duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements
                  required to be provided by such Lender as set forth above, to
                  establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with
                  respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is
                  not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed
                  completed copies of IRS Form W - 8IMY (or any successor
                  thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to
                  transmit with such form, and any other certificate or
                  statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish
                  that such Lender is not acting for its own account with
                  respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.

                           (iii)    The Borrower shall not be required to pay
                  any additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.1
                  (A) with respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or
                  withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or
                  statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form
                  W - 8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.15(a) or (B) if such
                  Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing provisions
                  of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender shall
                  have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the
                  date such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own
                  account with respect to any payment under any of the Credit
                  Documents, nothing in this Section 11.15(a) shall relieve the
                  Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to
                  Section 3.1 in the event

                  that, as a result of any change in any applicable Law, treaty
                  or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in
                  the interpretation, administration or application thereof,
                  such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms,
                  certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
                  establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the
                  account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under
                  any of the Credit Documents is not subject to withholding or
                  is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

                           (iv)     The Administrative Agent may, without
                  reduction, withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and
                  withheld from any payment under any of the Credit Documents
                  with respect to which the Borrower is not required to pay
                  additional amounts under this Section 11.15(a).

                  (b)      Each Lender that is a "United States person" within
         the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W -
         9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative
         Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount
         equivalent to the applicable back - up withholding tax imposed by the
         Code, without reduction.

                  (c)      If any Governmental Authority asserts that the
         Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as
         the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for
         the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the
         Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest,
         any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the
         Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
         (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation
         of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the
         Commitments, repayment of all other Credit Party Obligations hereunder
         and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         11.16    REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

         Under any circumstances set forth herein providing that the Borrower
shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this Credit Agreement,
the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign, and such Lender shall
assign, its Commitment and outstanding Loans (with the assignment fee to be paid
by the Eligible Assignee in such instance) at par (unless otherwise consented to
by such Lender) pursuant to Section 11.7(b) to one or more other Lenders or
Eligible Assignees procured by the Borrower. The Borrower shall (x) pay in full
all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Lender through the
date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.5) and
(y) release such Lender from its obligations under the Credit Documents. Any
Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such Lender's Commitment and outstanding Loans and
participations in L/C Obligations.
