         sections of the July 2000 Letter of Credit Agreement to which reference
         is made therein, and related definitions, schedules and ancillary
         provisions, are hereby incorporated herein by reference, MUTATIS
         MUTANDIS, and will be deemed to continue in effect for the benefit of
         the Issuing Bank and the Banks, as if each Bank were a "Lender" under

         Letter of Credit Agreement remains in effect among the parties thereto.

<PAGE>

                  (e) any Credit Party or any Subsidiary of any Credit Party
         shall default (i) in any payment of principal of or interest on any
         other obligation for borrowed money in principal amount of $50,000,000
         or more, or any payment of any principal amount of $50,000,000 or more
         under Hedging Agreements (as defined in the July 2000 Letter of Credit
         Agreement), in each case beyond any period of grace provided with
         respect thereto, or (ii) in the performance of any other agreement,
         term or condition contained in any such agreement (other than Hedging
         Agreements) under which any such obligation in principal amount of
         $50,000,000 or more is created, if the effect of such default is to
         cause or permit the holder or holders of such obligation (or trustee on
         behalf of such holder or holders) to cause such obligation to become
         due prior to its stated maturity or to terminate its commitment under
         such agreement, PROVIDED that this clause (e) shall not apply to
         secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale
         or transfer of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness;

         (e) Section 7.01(f) of the Reimbursement Agreement is hereby amended to

         and the same shall not have been vacated, discharged, stayed (whether
         by appeal or otherwise) or bonded pending appeal within 45 days from
         the entry thereof;

         SECTION 2. REDUCTION OF LETTER OF CREDIT PARTICIPATING INTEREST
COMMITTED AMOUNT. The Letter of Credit Participating Interest Committed Amount
of the Bank is hereby reduced to $138,607,449.20. The XL Parties hereby
irrevocably agree and direct that the Letter of Credit Participating Interest
Committed Amount of the Bank shall be further reduced from time to time,
concurrently with the cancellation of or drawing under any Letter of Credit, to
the Aggregate Letter of Credit Undrawn Availability at such time. The effect and
intention of the foregoing is that, from and after the date of this Amendment,
the Issuing Bank shall have no further obligation to issue any Letter of Credit
under the Reimbursement Agreement. In addition, the XL Parties agree that, from
and after the date of this Amendment, the Issuing Bank shall have no obligation
to extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit, permit the extension of
the expiration date of any Letter of Credit, increase the stated amount of any
Letter of Credit or issue any other amendment to any Letter of Credit.

         SECTION 3. CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS. This Second Amendment shall
become effective upon (i) the execution and delivery hereof by the XL Parties,
the Bank, the Issuing Bank and the Agent, (ii) the execution and delivery by the
parties thereof of the Second Amendment to the Pledge Agreement dated as of the

A hereto are the only Letters of Credit outstanding under the Reimbursement
Agreement.

         SECTION 4. EFFECT OF AMENDMENT. The Reimbursement Agreement, as amended
by this Amendment, is in all respects ratified, approved and confirmed and
shall, as so amended, remain in full force and effect.

said Commonwealth.

         SECTION 6. COUNTERPARTS. This Amendment may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts,
