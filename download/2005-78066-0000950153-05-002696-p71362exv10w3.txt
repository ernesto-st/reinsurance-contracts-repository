Collateral to exercise the rights retained by them in such Collateral, and none
of the Senior Lenders or their respective attorneys-in-fact, the Offshore
Collateral Agent, the Onshore Collateral Agent nor any other Appointed Party
shall take any action prior to the taking of such Borrower Enforcement Action

notice from the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(iii) or Section
5.10 of this Agreement directing the Trustee and the Borrower to apply funds in

continue to apply funds standing to the credit of the Proceeds Account and its
Sub-Accounts and the Borrower shall continue to apply funds standing to the
credit of the Onshore Accounts, as contemplated in this Article IV, except that:

          (i) Upon receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, the
     Trustee shall apply the balance standing to the credit of the Restricted
     Payment Sub-Account to credit the Proceeds Account and, thereafter, the
     Trustee shall not make any further credit to the Restricted Payment

     4.18 Waterfall Following Borrower Enforcement Direction. After receipt by

Section 4.18, the Trustee shall operate the Proceeds Account and its

priority level shall be made if any application remains to be made at any higher

     Business Days after a request thereof, by the Borrower);

          (ii) Second, to the payment (as determined by the Administrative Agent

               (C) principal; and

               (D) all other amounts owing in respect of such Senior Loans
          Obligations;


                                       26
<PAGE>
     and in case such moneys shall not be sufficient to pay in full the whole
     amount so due and unpaid under either clause (A), (B), (C) or (D), then to
     make Pro Rata Payments, without any preference or priority, to each Senior
     Lender; and

          (iii) Third, as directed by the Borrower, any portion of such funds
     remaining after application pursuant to clauses "first" and "second" above.

     4.19 Acceptable Credit Support Instruments.

     (a) All references in this Agreement to funds standing to the credit of any
of the Accounts or Sub-Accounts shall include all Acceptable Credit Support
Instruments provided with respect thereto.

     (b) The Trustee shall, without need for further instruction or
authorization, make drawings under any Acceptable Credit Support Instrument,
held by it at any time that a payment or transfer is required to be made from a
Sub-Account with respect to which such Acceptable Credit Support Instrument has
been delivered to the Trustee and sufficient funds are not then available in
such Sub-Account (after any necessary liquidation of Permitted Investments
therein pursuant to Section 4.20(b)) to make the full amount of such payment or
transfer. In such a case, the Trustee shall draw under the Acceptable Credit
Support Instrument such amount (up to the aggregate undrawn amount of such
Acceptable Credit Support Instrument) as may be necessary to make the full
amount of such required payment or transfer. In addition, (i) at any time after
receipt by the Trustee of a Borrower Enforcement Direction, the Trustee shall
draw under such Acceptable Credit Support Instrument(s) specified in such
Enforcement Direction, in the amounts and at the times specified in such
Enforcement Direction and (ii) at any time (A) that any Acceptable Credit
Support Instrument is scheduled to expire during the following fifteen (15)
Business Days and (B) no Acceptable Credit Support Instrument, with a later
expiry date and in a face amount greater than or equal to the undrawn amount of
the expiring Acceptable Credit Support Instrument has been delivered to the
Trustee in replacement therefor, the Trustee shall draw under the Acceptable
Credit Support Instrument so expiring, the full undrawn amount of such
Acceptable Credit Support Instrument.

     (c) At any time prior to a Borrower Enforcement Direction and at the
written request of the Borrower, the Trustee shall return to the Borrower:

          (i) any Acceptable Credit Support Instrument provided with respect to
     the Senior Debt Service Reserve Sub-Account, the Extraordinary Major
     Maintenance Reserve Sub-Account, the Tax Contingency Reserve Sub-Account
     and the Power Generator Sub-Account if (and only to the extent that) a
     Senior Debt Service Reserve Excess, an Extraordinary Major Maintenance
     Reserve Excess, a Tax Contingency Reserve Excess or a Power Generator
     Reserve Excess, as the case may be, exists (in each case (x) as identified
     by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at least 15 Business Days prior
     to the proposed date for the return of such Acceptable Credit Support
     Instrument and so long as the Administrative Agent acting upon instructions
     from the Majority Lenders does not object to such determination within 15
     Business Days of such identification and (y) it being understood that the
     Trustee shall have no duty to verify whether the events set forth above
     have occurred); and


                                       27
<PAGE>
          (ii) any Acceptable Credit Support Instrument provided with respect to
     a Restricted Payment made in the circumstances contemplated under Section
     4.09(i)(C) if the Borrower provides the Trustee with a duly completed
     Restricted Payment Certificate in replacement of the Partial Restricted
     Payment Certificate in connection with which the Borrower had previously
     provided the Acceptable Credit Support Instrument.

     4.20 Investment of Funds in Accounts.

     (a) Unless a Borrower Event of Default shall be Continuing, the Trustee
shall invest funds (and vary and redeem such investments) in the Proceeds
Account and its Sub-Accounts, as directed by the Borrower, and the Borrower
shall have the right to cause the investment of funds in the Onshore Accounts,
provided in each case that such investment is a Permitted Investment. During the
Continuance of a Borrower Event of Default, investments in Permitted Investments
shall be made as directed by the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions
from the Majority Lenders) or as directed by the Borrower if the Administrative
Agent (acting upon instructions from the Majority Lenders) so agrees.

     (b) Whenever the Trustee is directed or authorized in accordance with the
terms hereof to make a transfer of funds among Accounts or Sub-Accounts, after
application of all other available funds, the Trustee shall allocate to the
Account or Sub-Account to which such funds are to be transferred a portion of
any Permitted Investment that would otherwise have to be liquidated to
accomplish such transfer in an amount corresponding to the amount to be so
transferred. Whenever the Trustee is directed or authorized in accordance with
the terms hereof to make a transfer of funds from the Accounts (unless such
transfer is between Accounts or Sub-Accounts), if, after application of all
other available funds, liquidation of a Permitted Investment is necessary to
make any such transfer, the Trustee is authorized to liquidate such Permitted
Investment. If any Permitted Investment so liquidated is then allocated to more
than one Account or Sub-Account, and it is not possible to liquidate only the
portion of such Permitted Investment allocated to the Account or Sub-Account
from which such transfer is to be made, then the entire Permitted Investment
shall be liquidated, and the proceeds of such liquidation shall be allocated to
the Accounts or Sub-Accounts involved in the same proportion as the allocation
of such Permitted Investment, except that the net costs and expenses, if any, of
such liquidation (including any loss of principal) shall be allocated entirely
to the Account or Sub-Account from which the transfer of funds was required to
be made. The Trustee shall liquidate all those Permitted Investments which can
be liquidated without interest cost or penalty before it shall liquidate any
Permitted Investment, the liquidation of which would involve an interest cost or
penalty. The Trustee shall have no liability with respect to any interest cost
or penalty on the liquidation of any Permitted Investment pursuant to this
Section 4.20(b).

     (c) The Trustee shall have no liability with respect to Permitted
Investments (or any losses resulting therefrom) made at the direction of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this
Section 4.20.

     (d) All references in this Agreement to the Accounts and to cash, moneys or
funds therein or balances thereof shall include the investments in which such
moneys are then invested.


                                       28
<PAGE>
     (e) The Trustee may execute any investment instruction provided to it in
respect of the Permitted Investments through its Affiliates, and neither the
Trustee nor its Affiliates shall have a duty to monitor the investment rating of
any such Permitted Investments. The Trustee will have no obligation to invest or
reinvest any funds if all or a portion of such funds are deposited with the
Trustee after 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day of deposit. Instructions to
invest or reinvest that are received after 4:00 p.m. New York time will be
treated as if received on the following business day in New York. The Trustee
will have the power to sell or liquidate Permitted Investments whenever the
Trustee will be required to make a transfer pursuant to the terms hereof. The
Trustee will have no responsibility for any investment losses resulting from the
investment, reinvestment or liquidation of any funds. Any interest or other
income received on Permitted Investments will become part of the trust funds
held by the Trustee in accordance with the terms hereof and will be deemed to be
funds of the Borrower for U.S. tax purposes. If a selection is not made, the
balance standing to the credit of the Proceeds Account will remain uninvested
with no liability for interest therein. It is agreed and understood that the
Trustee may earn fees associated with Permitted Investments.

     4.21 Currencies. Unless a Borrower Event of Default shall be Continuing,
all exchanges or purchases of currencies, including currency conversions in
connection with transfers of funds between an Onshore Account denominated in
Dollars and an Onshore Account denominated in Nuevos Soles (or vice versa),
shall be directed by the Borrower. In the event that the Borrower directs the
Onshore Collateral Agent to make such exchange or purchase, the Onshore
Collateral Agent shall effect such exchange or purchase as directed, and the
cost and expense of all such transactions shall be for the account of the
Borrower. The Onshore Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for any losses
occurring as the result of any conversions, exchanges or purchases of currencies
hereunder unless such loss was the result of the Onshore Collateral Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. During the Continuance of a Borrower
Event of Default, foreign exchange transactions shall be made as directed by the
Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from the Majority Lenders), or as
directed by the Borrower if the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions
from the Majority Lenders) so agrees.

     4.22 Interest. Any interest or other earnings accrued on any balances in
any Account or Sub-Account, or on any investment thereof, shall be credited to
and accumulated in such Account or Sub-Account and thereafter be applied without
differentiation from other funds in such Account or Sub-Account.

     4.23 Reports to the Borrower and the Senior Lenders.

     (a) The Trustee shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative
Agent a report with respect to the Proceeds Account and its Sub-Accounts,
setting forth in reasonable detail all deposits to and disbursements from such
Account and Sub-Accounts, including the date on which made, and the balances of
and any investments in such Account and Sub-Accounts.

     (b) Such reports shall be delivered within 15 Business Days after the end
of the calendar month during which the Closing Date occurs and each calendar
month thereafter, to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent.


                                       29
<PAGE>
     (c) The Borrower shall be given remote access (including the ability to
print reports) to the Proceeds Account and its Sub-Accounts.

     (d) The Trustee shall provide any additional information or reports
relating to the Proceeds Account and its Sub-Accounts and the transactions
therein and the Acceptable Credit Support Instrument reasonably requested from
time to time by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (acting upon
instructions from any Senior Lender).

     (e) The Borrower shall cause the Depository Bank to deliver to the
Administrative Agent, within 15 Business Days after the end of the calendar
month during which the Closing Date occurs and each calendar month thereafter, a
report with respect to the Onshore Dollars Account and the Onshore Nuevos Soles
Account, setting forth in reasonable detail all deposits to and disbursements
from such Accounts, including the date on which made, and the balances of and
any investments in such Accounts.

     4.24 Limitations on Trustee's, Offshore Collateral Agent's and Onshore
Collateral Agent's Duties. Except as set forth in Section 7.05 hereof, none of
the Trustee, the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent
shall have any duty to, nor shall it, consider (i) whether any notice, direction
or certificate given by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Article IV or otherwise is true or correct, (ii) whether a transfer,
withdrawal or disposition of funds from any Account that the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent directs the Trustee, the Offshore Collateral Agent and the
Onshore Collateral Agent to make is for a purpose set forth in this Article IV,
(iii) whether any investment directed to be made by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent is a Permitted Investment or (iv) whether a transfer of
funds among or between Accounts or Sub-Accounts is for a purpose set forth in
this Article IV. In fulfilling its duties hereunder with respect to operation of
the Accounts in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, the Trustee,
the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent shall be required
to use the degree of care required of it under applicable law and by this
Agreement.

     4.25 Books and Records.

     (a) The Trustee and the Offshore Collateral Agent shall maintain all such
accounts, books and records as may be necessary properly to record all
transactions carried out by it with respect to the Proceeds Account and its
Sub-Accounts. The Trustee and the Offshore Collateral Agent shall permit the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from the
Majority Lenders) to examine such accounts, books and records, provided that any
such examination shall occur upon reasonable notice and during normal business
hours.

     (b) The Borrower shall cause each of the Depository Bank and the Onshore
Bank to maintain all such accounts, books and records as may be necessary
properly to record all transactions carried out by it with respect to the
Onshore Accounts maintained by it. The Borrower shall cause the Depository Bank
and the Onshore Bank to permit the Administrative Agent (acting upon
instructions from the Majority Lenders) to examine such accounts, books and
records, provided that any such examination shall occur upon reasonable notice
and during normal business hours.

     4.26 Stamp and Other Similar Taxes. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Trustee and the Collateral Agents from, and shall reimburse
the Trustee and the Collateral Agents for, any present or future claim for
liability for any stamp or other similar tax and any penalties or interest with
respect thereto, which may be assessed, levied or collected by any jurisdiction
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Document, or the trust created
hereunder. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive the
termination of the other provisions of this Agreement.

     4.27 Inadequately Identified Amounts. In the event that the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent receives any amount which is
inadequately or incorrectly identified as to the Account into which such amount
is to be credited, the Offshore Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral
Agent, as the case may be, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such event
and shall request instructions as to the Account into which such amount should
be credited. The Offshore Collateral Agent shall credit such amount to the
Proceeds Account and the Onshore Collateral Agent shall credit such amount to
the Onshore Dollars Account (in the case of U.S.$) or to the Onshore Nuevos
Soles Account (in the case of Nuevos Soles) until such time as they receive
instructions from the Administrative Agent stating that such amount should be
credited to another Account in accordance with this Agreement, in which case
they shall credit such amount to the Account designated by the Administrative
Agent.

themselves may take, or agree that one or more Borrower Enforcing Lender may
take, any Borrower Enforcement Action that the Administrative Agent is

judgment or for any act done or omitted to be done by it in good faith or for
any mistake of fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from
doing, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No Appointing
Party shall be liable for any act done or omitted to be done by any Appointed
Party or by any of the Appointed Party's officers or employees.

     7.04 Consultation with Counsel, etc. Each Appointed Party may consult with,
and obtain advice from, legal counsel, accountants, engineers and other experts,
in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder and under any other
Financing Document and it shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected
in acting in good faith in accordance with the opinion and advice of such
counsel, accountants and other experts (as to matters within any such expert's
field of expertise). No Appointed Party shall be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any counsel, accountants, engineers and other experts selected
by it without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.

     7.05 Duties. Each Appointed Party shall have no duties other than those
specifically set forth or provided for in this Agreement and each other
Financing Document to which it is a party and no implied covenants or
obligations of such Appointed Party shall be read into this Agreement or any
other Financing Document or any related agreement to which it is a party. Each
Appointed Party shall have no obligation to familiarize itself with and shall
have no responsibility with respect to any other agreement or document relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing Documents
(except to the extent that action authorized or required to be taken by such
Appointed Party hereunder or under any other Financing Document to which it is a
party reasonably requires such Appointed Party so to familiarize itself) nor any
obligation to inquire whether any notice, certificate, instrument, demand,
request, direction, instruction, waiver, receipt, consent, document,
communication,


                                       50
<PAGE>
statement or calculation is in conformity with the terms of any such other
agreement, except those irregularities or errors manifestly apparent on the face
of such document or actually known to such Appointed Party. If, however, any
remittance or communication received by an Appointed Party appears manifestly
erroneous or irregular, such Appointed Party shall be under a duty to make
prompt inquiry to the Person originating such remittance or communication in
order to determine whether a clerical error or inadvertent mistake has occurred.

     7.06 Resignation, Replacement and Successor.

     (a) Each Appointed Party at any time may resign hereunder and under the
other Financing Documents upon giving not less than two months' notice in
writing to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or to the Borrower in case
of resignation by the Administrative Agent.

     (b) Each Appointed Party may be removed hereunder and under the other
Financing Documents by an instrument in writing signed by the Administrative
Agent (acting pursuant to a Supermajority Vote) and, if no Borrower Event of
Default has occurred and is Continuing, the Borrower.

     (c) Upon resignation or removal of an Appointed Party, a successor (i) if
no Borrower Event of Default has been declared and is Continuing, shall be
proposed by the Borrower and, if consented to by the Administrative Agent
(acting upon instructions from the Majority Lenders), shall be appointed by the
relevant Appointing Parties, or (ii) if a Borrower Event of Default has been
declared and is Continuing, or if the Borrower fails within 30 days after
receipt of notice of the resignation or removal of such Appointed Party to
propose a successor, shall be appointed by the Administrative Agent (acting upon
instructions from the Majority Lenders).

     (d) No resignation or removal of an Appointed Party and no appointment of a
successor shall be effective until (i) the successor has accepted its
appointment and (ii) all indemnities, compensation and expenses required by
Sections 7.07 and 7.08 hereof shall have been paid or provided.

     (e) If no successor to an Appointed Party shall have been so appointed and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the date fixed for
such resignation or such removal, the Appointed Party that has resigned or is
removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may
prescribe, appoint a successor. Any court-appointed successor Appointed Party
shall automatically be replaced by a successor Appointed Party subsequently
appointed by relevant MPA Parties pursuant to this Section 7.06. Any successor
appointed pursuant to this Section 7.06 shall be (i) in the case of the Onshore
Collateral Agent, a bank or trust company organized under the laws of Peru
having its principal corporate trust office in Lima and a combined capital and
surplus of at least U.S.$100,000,000 and (ii) in the case of the Administrative
Agent, a bank or trust company having a combined capital and surplus of at least
U.S.$200,000,000 and (iii) in the case of any other Appointed Party, a bank or
trust company organized under the laws of the United States or of the State of
New York having its principal


                                       51
<PAGE>
corporate trust office in The City of New York and a combined capital and
surplus of at least U.S.$200,000,000.

     (f) Any successor to an Appointed Party shall evidence its acceptance of
its appointment hereunder by executing and delivering to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent an instrument accepting its appointment for its role
hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, and thereupon such successor
Appointed Party, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become
vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor
hereunder and under the other Financing Documents with like effect as if
originally named as Appointed Party herein and therein in lieu of its
predecessor, and such predecessor shall have no further obligation or liability
thereunder except for liability with respect to its acts or omissions prior to
such succession pursuant to Section 7.03 hereof; nevertheless, on the request of
any party hereto or such successor Appointed Party, the Appointed Party ceasing
to act as such shall execute and deliver instruments transferring to such
successor all of its rights and powers hereunder and under the other Financing
Documents, including, if applicable, any such instruments necessary to transfer
the Accounts to such successor Appointed Party, and shall deliver to such
successor Appointed Party all property held by it in trust hereunder.

     7.07 Indemnity.

     (a) Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under Section 12.21 of
the MPA and without duplication thereof, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the
Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agents, and to hold each of
them and their officers, directors, agents and employees harmless against, any
loss, liability, claim, judgment, settlement, compromise, obligation, damage,
penalty, or reasonable cost, expense and disbursement of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, "Losses") with respect to the execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, and each other
Financing Document, unless arising from the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of such Appointed Party, or the officers, directors, agents
and employees that are seeking indemnification, including the reasonable costs
and expenses of defending itself and themselves against any claim of liability
in the premises.

     (b) Each of the Senior Lenders, ratably in accordance with its pro rata
share of the then aggregate Outstanding Advance Amount, agrees to indemnify the
Trustee, the Collateral Agents and the Administrative Agent and to hold each of
them and their officers, directors, agents and employees harmless against any
loss, liability, claim, judgment, settlement, compromise, obligation, damage,
penalty or reasonable cost, expense and disbursement of any kind or nature
whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, unless
arising from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such
Appointed Party, as the case may be, or the officers, directors, agents and
employees that are seeking indemnification, including the reasonable costs and
expenses of defending itself and themselves against any claim of liability in
the premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Peruvian Bondholder shall be
required to make any out of pocket disbursement on account of such
indemnification obligation.


                                       52
<PAGE>
     (c) As security for such payment and the payments referred to in this
Section 7.07, the Collateral Agents shall have a lien equal to the Senior Loans
upon all Collateral and other property and funds held or collected by each
Collateral Agent as part of the trust established hereunder. Upon its
resignation or removal, each Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to the prompt payment by the Borrower of its compensation and
indemnification for the services rendered under this Agreement and the other
Financing Documents, and to reimbursement of all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses up to the date of resignation or removal (including the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel, if any) incurred in connection with the performance of
such services.

     (d) The indemnification provision for the benefit of the Appointed Parties
acting in such capacity shall survive the termination of the other provisions of
this Agreement and the resignation or removal of such Appointed Party.

     7.08 Compensation. Each Appointed Party shall be entitled to such
compensation (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to
compensation of a trustee of an express trust) as may be agreed from time to
time between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to a
Supermajority Vote and such Appointed Party for all services rendered under this
Agreement and the other Financing Documents, and such compensation, together
with reimbursement for disbursements and expenses in connection with the
performance by such Appointed Party of its role (including the reasonable fees
and expenses of its agents and of counsel, accountants, engineers and other
experts referred to in Section 7.04 hereof), shall be paid by the Borrower (free
and clear of and without deduction by reason of any Peruvian taxes or other
impositions).

     7.09 Certificates. Whenever an Appointed Party shall deem it necessary or
desirable that a matter be proved or established in connection with taking or
omitting any action by it hereunder or under any other Financing Document, such
matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically
prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of such Appointed Party, be deemed to be conclusively proved or established
by a certificate of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to
instructions from the Requisite Lenders (determined based on the underlying
matter) delivered to such Appointed Party.

     7.10 Merger of Appointed Party. Any corporation into which an Appointed
Party shall be merged, or with which it shall be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which an Appointed
Party shall be a party, shall replace such Appointed Party under each Financing
Document without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of the MPA Parties and the disappearing Appointed Party shall promptly give
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower notice thereof; provided such
resulting or surviving corporation, as the case may be, shall immediately resign
as an Appointed Party hereunder if it would not have been eligible to act as a
successor to the disappearing Appointed Party in accordance with the provisions
of Section 7.06 hereof.


                                       53
<PAGE>
     7.11 Appointed Parties in Their Individual Capacity. Each Appointed Party
may make loans to the Borrower, including Senior Facility Loans, accept deposits
from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as though
such Appointed Party were not an Appointed Party hereunder and under the other
Financing Documents.

     7.12 Miscellaneous.

     (a) In the event of any disagreement among the Appointing Parties arising
in circumstances where an Appointed Party is to take or refrain from taking any
action under this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement, if the terms of
this Agreement or the relevant Financing Agreement do not unambiguously mandate
the action the Appointed Party is to take or not to take under the circumstances
then existing, or if the Appointed Party is in doubt as to what action it is
required to take or not to take or as to how to take any such action, the
Appointed Party shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action until
directed otherwise in writing by (i) (x) in the case of the Trustee, the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to instructions from the
Requisite Lenders (determined based on the underlying matter) prior to a
Borrower Event of Default or the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to
instructions from the Requisite Lenders (determined based on the underlying
matter) after a Borrower Event of Default and (y) in the case of any other
Appointed Party, the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to instructions from
the Requisite Lenders (determined based on the underlying matter) (unless
inconsistent with any direction of a court of competent jurisdiction) or (ii) a
court of competent jurisdiction, and the Appointed Party shall not, in each
case, incur any liability in acting or refraining from acting on ambiguous
instructions or until otherwise directed in writing in accordance with this
Section 7.12.

     (b) None of the provisions of any Financing Document shall be construed to
require any Appointed Party to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to
incur any personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder or thereunder. No Appointed Party shall be under any obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by any Financing Document at
the request or direction of its Appointing Parties, unless such Appointed Party
shall have been offered security or indemnity or other arrangement to reimburse
reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction (including
interest thereon from the time incurred until reimbursed).

     7.13 Exculpatory Provisions. The Offshore Collateral Agent and the Onshore
Collateral Agent make no representations as to the value or condition of the
trust created hereunder or any part thereof, or as to the title of the Borrower
thereto, or as to the rights and interests granted or the security afforded by
this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or (except by or with respect to
itself) as to the validity, execution, enforceability, legality or sufficiency
of this Agreement, any other Financing Document or the Senior Facility Loans
secured hereby, and each of the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Onshore
Collateral Agent (in its individual and trust capacities) shall incur no
liability or responsibility in respect of any such matters.


                                       54
<PAGE>
     7.14 Miscellaneous.

     (a) In the absence of actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the
Offshore Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be, will not
be deemed to have knowledge of any Borrower Event of Default, unless notified
thereof in writing by the Borrower or any Secured Party.

     (b) The rights, benefits, privileges and immunities given to the Offshore
Collateral Agent hereunder shall extend to, and be enforceable by, the Trustee
and by each agent attorney or other Person employed to act hereunder.

     (c) In any circumstance where a Collateral Agent is required to exercise
discretion, approve documentation, release Collateral or distribute proceeds
under any Financing Document, the Collateral Agent may, at its option, seek to
obtain instructions or directions from the Administrative Agent with respect to
such action. If a Collateral Agent so elects, then it may refrain from taking
such action until such directions or instructions are received and shall have no
liability to the Secured Parties or the Borrower for so refraining.

     (d) Anything in the Financing Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, in
no event shall the Trustee, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agents be
liable under or in connection with the Financing Documents for indirect,
special, incidental, punitive or consequential losses or damages of any kind
whatsoever.

     (e) In no event shall the Trustee, the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agents be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the
performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly
or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including without limitation strikes,
work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military
disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of god, and interruptions,
loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and
hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee, the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agents shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent
with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as
practicable under the circumstances.

     7.15 Assignment of Rights, Not Assumption of Duties. Anything herein
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Secured Parties shall be
obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower under any
of the Financing Documents to which the Borrower is a party or, except as
expressly provided herein with respect to the Trustee, the Administrative Agent
or the Onshore Collateral Agents to take any action to collect or enforce any
claim for payment assigned hereunder or otherwise.

     7.16 Appointment of Sub-Agent of the Offshore Collateral Agent or the
Onshore Collateral Agent.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time,
for the sole purpose of meeting any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in
which any Collateral may at the time be located, each of the Offshore Collateral
Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent shall have the power and may execute and
deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons to act as its agent or
sub-trustee of all or any part of the Collateral, and to vest in such Person or


                                       55
<PAGE>
Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit or on behalf of the Secured
Parties, such title to the Collateral, or any part thereof, and subject to the
other provisions of this Section 7.16, such powers, duties, obligations, rights
and trusts as the Offshore Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as
the case may be, may consider necessary or desirable, provided that the
appointment of such agent or sub-trustee shall be subject to the approval of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent prior to the occurrence of a Borrower
Event of Default and the Administrative Agent, after the occurrence of a
Borrower Event of Default, which approval, in each case, shall not be
unreasonable withheld, and provided further, that any such agent or sub-trustee
shall agree to be liable to the Secured Parties to the extent the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be, is so
liable pursuant to this Agreement.

     (b) All rights and powers, conferred or imposed upon the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may be
conferred or imposed upon and may be exercised or performed by an agent or
sub-trustee.

     (c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Offshore Collateral
Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall be deemed to
have been given to each of the agents or sub-trustees, as effectively as if
given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any agents or sub-trustees
shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article.

     (d) Any agent or sub-trustee may at any time appoint the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be, as its
agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not
prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on
its behalf and in its name. If any agent or sub-trustee shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties,
rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to the
extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor Offshore
Collateral Agent or Onshore Collateral Agent, as the case may be.

     7.17 Limitation on Duty of Collateral Agents in Respect of Collateral;
Indemnification.

     (a) Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the
Collateral Agents shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession or
control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income
thereon or as to preservation of rights against prior parties or any other
rights pertaining thereto and the Collateral Agents shall not be responsible for
filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or
instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or
maintaining the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral. The
Collateral Agents shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property and
shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or diminution in the value of
any of the Collateral, by reason of the act or omission of any carrier,
forwarding agency or other agent or bailee selected by the Collateral Agents in
good faith.


                                       56
<PAGE>
     (b) The Collateral Agents shall not be responsible for the existence,
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection,
priority or enforceability of the Liens in any of the Collateral, whether
impaired by operation of law or by reason of any of any action or omission to
act on its part hereunder, except to the extent such action or omission
constitutes gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the
Collateral Agents, for the validity or sufficiency of the Collateral or any
agreement or assignment contained therein, for the validity of the title of the
Borrower to the Collateral, for insuring the Collateral or for the payment of
taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the
maintenance of the Collateral.

in connection with the subject matter hereof except as specifically set forth

     9.06 Amendments and Waivers.

     (a) Neither this Agreement nor any terms hereof may be amended,

hereunder, such Appointed Party and (iii) by the Requisite Lenders.

     (b) No waiver by any Party of any of its rights, powers and privileges
under this Agreement shall be effective other than pursuant to a written
instrument executed by the Party waiving such right, power or privilege, except
that a waiver of rights, powers and privileges by


                                       61
<PAGE>
the Senior Lenders can be executed by the Administrative Agent acting in
accordance with Section 6.03.

     9.07 Benefits of Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the MSA Parties and their successors and
permitted assigns hereunder, any benefit or any legal or equitable right or
remedy under this Agreement.

     9.08 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Appointed Parties and the Senior Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from each Senior

     9.09 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction.

     (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit of
each Party hereto, that any legal action, suit or proceeding against it with
respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement may be brought in any Federal or State
court located in New York County in the City of New York and hereby irrevocably
accepts and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such court with respect
to any such action, suit or proceeding. The Borrower hereby waives any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
aforesaid actions, suits or proceedings, brought in any such court and hereby
further waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

     (b) Under the MPA, the Borrower has irrevocably appointed CT Corporation,
with offices at the date of this Agreement at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York,
U.S.A., as its authorized agent on which any and all legal process may be served
in any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any Federal or State court
located in New York County in the City of New York. The Borrower agrees that
service of process in respect of it upon such agent, together with written
notice of such service given to it in the manner provided in Section 9.04
hereof, shall be


                                       62
<PAGE>
deemed to be effective service of process upon it in any such action, suit or
proceeding. The Borrower agrees that the failure of such agent to give notice to
it of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity of such service
or any judgment rendered in any action, suit or proceeding based thereon. If for
any reason such agent shall cease to be available to act as such, the Borrower
agrees to designate a new agent in New York County in the City of New York, on
the terms and for the purposes of this Section 9.10. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit the ability of the Offshore Collateral Agent or Onshore
Collateral Agent to serve any such legal process in any other manner permitted
by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Borrower or bring actions,
suits or proceedings against them in such other jurisdictions, and in such
manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.

     9.11 No Trial by Jury. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     9.12 Remedies.

     (a) Other than as stated expressly herein, no remedy herein conferred upon
the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent for the benefit
and on behalf of the Secured Parties is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in additional
to every other remedy given hereunder, under the other Financing Documents, or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statue or otherwise.

     (b) No failure on the part of any Senior Lender to exercise and no delay in
exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power, or
privilege under this Agreement or any other Financing Document shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege under any such document preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No Senior Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Senior Lender to perform its
obligations hereunder or under any Senior Loan Agreement.

     (c) In case any Senior Lender shall have proceeded to enforce any right,
remedy or power under this Agreement or any other Financing Document and the
proceeding for the enforcement thereof shall have been discontinued or abandoned
for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to such Senior Lender,
then and in every such case the Borrower and the Senior Lenders shall, subject
to any effect of or determination in such proceeding, severally and respectively
be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under such other
Financing Document.

     9.13 Currency Equivalents. Calculation of currency equivalents (for any
amount, its "Equivalent") on any day shall be based on the foreign exchange spot
mid-rates for such day reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or,
if not so reported, on the mid-market foreign exchange spot closing rates for
such day reported in the Financial Times, or, if not so reported, on spot
foreign exchange mid-market rates for trading among banks in amounts of
U.S.$1,000,000 and more as quoted by or to the Trustee.

     9.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any law, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     9.15 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different Parties on separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all the
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

     9.16 No Partnership. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action by
any of the Parties is intended to constitute or shall be deemed to constitute
among such Parties a partnership, association, joint venture or other entity.

This instrument is executed under the terms and conditions stated below:

1.   PREAMBLE

1.1  The Borrower has legal title over certain mining concessions granted by the
     pertinent Peruvian Governmental Authorities, for the operation of the Cerro
     Verde copper mine, including a copper leaching and solution
     extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW) operation, located in the Districts of
     Uchumayo and Yarabamba, Province of Arequipa, Peru (the "Existing Mine").

1.2  The board of directors of the Borrower has approved the development of a
     primary sulfide ore body beneath the oxide ore body currently in production
     (the "Sulfide Project" and, together with the Existing Mine, the "Mines"),
     for which purposes the Borrower intends to obtain financing in an
     approximate amount of Four Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars of the United
     States of America (US$ 450,000,000.00).

1.3  The Borrower has entered into a Master Participation Agreement among the
     Borrower, the Senior Facility Lenders, the Lead JBIC Arrangers, the Global
     Coordinators, the Lead Arrangers, and the Administrative Agent in order to
     set forth the general financing arrangement for the Sulfide Project.

1.4  The Borrower has entered into: (i) the JBIC Loan Agreement with JBIC; (ii)
     the KfW Loan Agreement with KfW; and (iii) the Commercial Banks Loan

<PAGE>
1.5  The Borrower intends to issue the Peruvian Bonds in the Peruvian market
     through a bond program in order to complete the financing that it requires
     for the development of the Sulfide Project.

1.6  The Borrower has entered into a Master Security Agreement among the
     Borrower, the Senior Facility Lenders, the Lead JBIC Arrangers, the Global
     Coordinators, the Lead Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Trustee,
     the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent in order to
     set forth, among other things, the terms of the security interests to be
     granted by the Borrower in favor of the Onshore Collateral Agent, who acts
     for the benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties, to secure the timely
     and full payment or prepayment by the Borrower of the Secured Obligations.

     New Party Accession Agreement and thereupon the Peruvian Bondholders acting
     through the Common Representative will, collectively, have all of the
     rights and obligations of a Senior Lender under the Master Security
     Agreement, including, without limitation, the right of the Common
     Representative, on behalf of the Peruvian Bondholders, to benefit as a
     Senior Lender from the security to be granted by the Borrower to the
     Secured Parties pursuant to the Master Security Agreement and the other
     Security Documents, including, without limitation, the security interest
     created by this Agreement.

1.7  Pursuant to the Master Security Agreement, the Borrower has undertaken to
     secure the Secured Obligations by granting a mining pledge over certain
     Goods and Assets permanently used in connection with the mining activities
     of the Borrower at the Mines.

1.8  The Borrower and the Onshore Collateral Agent have entered into this
     Agreement for the purpose of creating a mining pledge over the Goods and
     Assets in favor of the Onshore Collateral Agent, for the benefit and on
     behalf of the Secured Parties.

     amount is an amount not to exceed Four Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars of
     the United States of America (US$ 450,000,000.00), plus all applicable
     interest, expenses and fees as well as any and all costs and expenses
     ("costas y costos") in the event that the foreclosure of the Guaranty is
     necessary (the "Lien's Amount").

4.2  The Parties hereby agree that:

     (a)  the total amount secured by this Mining Pledge shall include any
          amount which may be payable to the Secured Parties pursuant to Section

     obligations described in this Section 5.3 if any modification is produced
     in accordance with the following:

          Date; and


                                                                               5

5.4  This Mining Pledge is granted exclusively in favor of the Onshore
     Collateral Agent for the benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties.

     secure the timely and full payment or prepayment by the Borrower of the
     Secured Obligations.

6.2  Except to the extent set forth in Section 10, this Mining Pledge shall
     remain in force and effect until the earlier of (i) all the Secured
     Obligations have been paid or prepaid in full, even if this Mining Pledge
     and/or the Guaranty is divided or (ii) so long as the Senior Facility Loans
     Obligations have been paid or prepaid in full, the Borrower, with the
     consent of the Onshore Collateral Agent, seeks to terminate this Agreement
     as contemplated under Section 7.03 of the Peruvian Bonds Indenture. The
     Guaranty shall not be totally or partially cancelled, discharged, removed
     or separated from this Mining Pledge, until all of the Secured Obligations
     have been paid or prepaid in full by the Borrower (in the case of clause
     (i)) or the Onshore Collateral Agent so consents (in the case of clause
     (ii)).

6.3  Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 11.2, it is agreed
     that any of the Goods and Assets shall be released from the Mining Pledge
     to the extent that the Borrower disposes of any such Goods and Assets in

     Agreement.

          hereby undertakes to file the respective public deeds for recordation

     (b)  The Goods and Assets are located within the premises of the Core

          district of Arequipa - Cercado.

          The Onshore Collateral Agent shall be entitled to exercise any and all
          rights, prerogatives and actions permitted by this Agreement, the
          Master Security Agreement or applicable Peruvian law.

          the addition of further Goods and Assets pursuant to the amendment
          obligations of the Borrower described in Section 5.3.

          Upon a Borrower Event of Default and while it is Continuing, the
          Onshore Collateral Agent shall have the right to request an appraisal
          of the Guaranty,

          which appraisal shall be performed by any one of the pre-approved
          appraisers listed in Exhibit 3 or any other appraiser agreed to by the

          the Guaranty the aggregate value of the Goods and Assets shall be the
          aggregate value thereof as determined by such appraiser in such
          appraisal.

          If the Guaranty is foreclosed upon through a judicial procedure as
          referred to in Section 9.2(b), the equivalent of 2/3 of the above
          mentioned amount (as amended or appraised) shall serve as the basic

          such foreclosure proceeding, subsequently reducing said value,
          according to law, for any subsequent auctions, as the case may be.

     Obligations. This Mining Pledge extends, without any limitation, to any and

3.4  Considering the fungible nature of the Mineral and Cathode and Concentrate,
     this Mining Pledge is granted as a floating lien. Accordingly, the Mineral

<PAGE>
     (c)  The Mineral and Cathode and Concentrate, as the case may be, are free

9.   FORECLOSURE OF THE GUARANTY

9.1  Foreclosure and enforcement of the Guaranty shall only be made in
     accordance with the terms of the Master Security Agreement and this Section
     9.

9.2  Upon receipt by the Onshore Collateral Agent of an instruction from the
     Administrative Agent to take a Borrower Enforcement Action with respect to
     the Guaranty pursuant to the terms of the Master Security Agreement, the
     Onshore Collateral Agent shall have the right to proceed to foreclose upon
     the Guaranty. Such foreclosure upon the Guaranty shall take place in
     accordance with either of the procedures set forth in (a) and (b) below:

     (a)  Private Sale

          The Guaranty may be foreclosed upon in whole or in part through a
          direct sale or a public or private auction procedure in accordance
          with Article 183 of the General Mining Law and Article 1069 of the
          Civil Code. Such sale or auction shall be carried out by the Onshore
          Collateral Agent, acting as instructed by the Administrative Agent, in
          a commercially reasonable manner.

          The Onshore Collateral Agent shall be entitled to exercise any and all
          rights, prerogatives and actions permitted by this Agreement, the
          Master Security Agreement or applicable Peruvian law.

          If the Guaranty is foreclosed through an auction, such auction shall
          be performed by an authorized auctioneer designated by the Onshore
          Collateral Agent. The auction may take place where the Mineral and
          Cathode and Concentrate are located or at any other place that may be
          determined by the Onshore Collateral Agent. The Onshore Collateral
          Agent shall provide no less than twenty (20) days notice in advance of
          such auction, which such notice shall include an identification of the
          designated auctioneer.

          To the extent permitted by applicable Peruvian law and the Master
          Security Agreement, the Onshore Collateral Agent shall have the right
          to bid for and purchase the Mineral and Cathode and Concentrates
          offered for sale at the auction described herein, and upon compliance
          with the terms of the sale may hold and dispose of such property.


                                                                               7
<PAGE>
     (b)  Judicial Action ("ejecucion judicial")

          Alternatively, the Guaranty may be foreclosed in whole or in part upon
          through a judicial procedure in accordance with Article 720 et seq. of
          the Code of Civil Procedure, before the judges of the judicial
          district of Arequipa - Cercado.

          The Onshore Collateral Agent shall be entitled to exercise any and all
          rights, prerogatives and actions permitted by this Agreement, the
          Master Security Agreement or applicable Peruvian law.

     (c)  Assessment of the Guaranty

          Subject to the following paragraph, for all purposes concerning the
          enforcement of the Guaranty, considering the commodity nature of the
          Mineral and Cathode and Concentrate, the value of the Mineral and
          Cathode and Concentrate being foreclosed upon shall be that which
          results from the market price thereof at the time of the direct sale
          or initiation of the auction proceeding.

          Upon a Borrower Event of Default and while it is Continuing, the
          Onshore Collateral Agent shall have the right to request an appraisal
          of the Guaranty, which appraisal shall be performed by any one of the
          pre-approved appraisers listed in Exhibit 2 or any other appraiser
          agreed to by the Parties, in which case for all purposes concerning
          the enforcement of the Guaranty the aggregate value of the Mineral and
          Cathode and Concentrate being foreclosed upon shall be the aggregate
          value thereof as determined by such appraiser in such appraisal.

          If the Guaranty is foreclosed upon through a judicial procedure as
          referred to in Section 9.2(b), the equivalent of 2/3 of the above
          mentioned amount (as appraised) shall serve as the basic value of the
          Mineral and Cathode and Concentrate being foreclosed upon for the
          first auction undertaken within such foreclosure proceeding,
          subsequently reducing said value, according to law, for any subsequent
          auctions, as the case may be.

9.3  The Borrower hereby waives its right to make any claim in connection with
     the foreclosure upon the Guaranty against the Onshore Collateral Agent to
     the extent that the Onshore Collateral Agent fully complies with the
     procedure for foreclosure set forth in this Section 9 and the relevant
     provisions of the Master Security Agreement.

10.  OBLIGATION OF THE ONSHORE COLLATERAL AGENT

     The Onshore Collateral Agent hereby covenants and agrees to promptly
     release this Mining Pledge, and to take all actions necessary to formalize

     Borrower's full payment or prepayment of the Secured Obligations, all of
     the Borrower's credit rights in all Domestic Sales Agreements that exist as
     of the date hereof, if any, and that the Borrower may enter into following
     the date hereof, which credit rights consist of the Borrower's rights to
     receive any current and future payments, whether determined or to be
     determined, pursuant to any and all Domestic Sales Agreements, including,
     but not limited to, price, interest, fees, penalties, compensations,
     indemnities and any other monetary amounts.

3.2. The Borrower shall remain liable to perform all its obligations pursuant to
     and with respect to each Domestic Sales Agreement, and the Onshore
     Collateral Agent shall not be under any obligation in respect thereof or be
     under any liability in the event of a failure by the Borrower to perform
     its obligations in respect thereof.

3.3  The Parties acknowledge and declare that the conditional assignment of
     rights granted hereunder has the purpose of serving as security for the
     Secured Obligations, and shall not be considered as a payment by the
     Borrower of the Secured Obligations.

4.   EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ASSIGNMENT

4.1  With respect to any Domestic Sales Agreement that (i) has a term of three
     (3) years or more and (ii) contemplates annual sales of at least 50,000 dry
     short tons of Cathodes or Concentrate (each, a "Notice Sales Agreement"),
     concurrently with or within three (3) Peruvian Business Days of entering
     into any such Notice Sales Agreement, the Borrower shall provide or cause
     to be provided notice to the applicable Buyer either (A) through the
     delivery of a written notice of conditional assignment substantially in the
     form attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (the "Notice of Conditional Assignment")
     through notarial notification, which Notice of Conditional Assignment shall
     instruct the applicable Buyer to pay all Proceeds from such Domestic Sales
     directly into the Onshore Dollars Account and shall expressly indicate that
     such assignment shall become effective with respect to such Buyer upon the
     delivery of a notice of effectiveness by the Onshore Collateral Agent to
     such Buyer substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2 (the
     "Notice of Effectiveness"), or (B) through an acknowledgment and consent
     substantially in the


                                                                               3
<PAGE>
     form attached hereto as Exhibit 3 (the "Domestic Buyer's Acknowledgement")
     to the effect that such Buyer has received notice from the Borrower of the
     conditional assignment of the Notice Sales Agreement that such Buyer will
     pay all Proceeds from such Domestic Sales directly into the Onshore Dollars
     Account and that such assignment shall become effective with respect to
     such Buyer upon the delivery of a notice of effectiveness by the Onshore
     Collateral Agent to such Buyer substantially in the form attached as Annex
     A to Exhibit 3 hereto. The Borrower shall deliver to the Onshore Collateral
     Agent a copy certified by a notary public of each Notice of Conditional
     Assignment or Domestic Buyer's Acknowledgement, as the case may be, within
     three (3) Peruvian Business Days following its delivery.

4.2  Upon receipt by the Onshore Collateral Agent of an instruction from the
     Administrative Agent to take a Borrower Enforcement Direction with respect
     to the assignment of rights granted under this Agreement pursuant to the
     terms of the Master Security Agreement, the Onshore Collateral Agent shall
     proceed to deliver the relevant Notices of Effectiveness through notarial
     notification, in each case with copy to the Borrower. The assignment of
     rights granted under this Agreement shall become effective vis-a-vis each
     applicable Buyer upon the delivery thereto of the relevant Notice of
     Effectiveness.

4.3  The Borrower shall immediately inform the Onshore Collateral Agent of any
     change of address that may have been communicated thereto by any Buyer.

4.4  Because the conditional assignment of rights granted under this Agreement
     shall become effective vis-a-vis each applicable Buyer only upon the
     delivery thereto of the relevant Notice of Effectiveness, notwithstanding
     the instructions provided by the Borrower to, or acknowledged by, the
     applicable Buyers under Notice Sales Agreements as set forth herein to
     cause all Proceeds from Domestic Sales to be made directly into the Onshore
     Dollars Account, the Borrower shall continue to be considered the title
     holder of the rights conditionally assigned hereunder until the delivery to
     the Borrower of copy of the Notice of Effectiveness and shall be fully
     entitled to exercise such rights without limitation until the occurrence of
     such delivery.

5.   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ASSIGNMENT

5.1  Except as set forth in Section 8, the conditional assignment of rights
     granted hereunder shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the Borrower's full
     payment or prepayment of the Secured Obligations or (ii) so long as the
     Senior Facility Loans Obligations have been paid or prepaid in full, the
     Borrower, with the consent of the Onshore Collateral Agent, seeks to
     terminate this Agreement as contemplated under Section 7.03 of the Peruvian
     Bonds Indenture, and either such termination shall be effected by means of
     a joint written notification to be sent by the Borrower and the Onshore
     Collateral Agent to the applicable Buyers so indicating. The Onshore


                                                                               4
<PAGE>
     Collateral Agent undertakes to make such notification acting as instructed
     by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.03 of the Master Security
     Agreement and immediately upon the request of the Borrower.

5.2  According to Article 1211 of Civil Code, upon its effectiveness, the
     assignment of the Borrower's rights shall include the transmission to the
     Onshore Collateral Agent of all of the privileges, guaranties and accessory
     rights that may exist in relation to the assigned rights.

5.3  Neither the conditional assignment of rights granted hereunder nor, upon
     its effectiveness, the assignment of the Borrower's rights shall be
     understood as an assignment of Borrower's contractual position in the
     Domestic Sales Agreements, and thus the Onshore Collateral Agent does not
     assume any obligation thereunder.

6.   OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWER

Notwithstanding all other obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Borrower
hereby undertakes to enter into any agreement and deliver any notice reasonably
necessary to effect the conditional assignment of the rights granted hereunder
and, upon its effectiveness, the assignment thereof with all its privileges,
warranties and accessory rights, provided that the Borrower shall not be
required to enter into any such agreement or deliver any such notice, including,
without limitation, a Notice of Conditional Assignment or any other notice to
any Buyer with respect to Domestic Sales Agreements that are not Notice Sales
Agreements.

7.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWER

7.1  As the date hereof, the Borrower makes the following representations and
     warranties to the Onshore Collateral Agent:

     (a)  The Borrower is and will be the only title holder of the conditionally
          assigned rights and is and will be entitled to assign such rights, and
          therefore it has the full right, power and authority to enter into
          this Agreement without violating any contractual, legal, or other
          obligation to any entity or person; and

     (b)  The conditionally assigned rights are not subject to any prior lien or
          encumbrance that could limit its ability to assign such rights in
          favor of the Onshore Collateral Agent.


                                                                               5

8.   OBLIGATION OF THE ONSHORE COLLATERAL AGENT

The Onshore Collateral Agent hereby covenants and agrees to promptly release the
conditional assignment granted under this Agreement over all of the Borrower's
rights under all Domestic Sales Agreements, and to take all actions necessary to
formalize such release, in the event that (i) prior to the occurrence of the
Closing Date and prior to the issuance of any Peruvian Bonds, the Borrower
terminates and reduces all Commitments to zero, or (ii) the conditional
assignment of rights granted hereunder has terminated as provided in Section
5.1.

Upon the acceptance of a designation hereunder, the successor or assign of the
Escrow Agent shall thereupon succeed to and be vested with all of the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the Escrow Agent, and the retiring Escrow Agent
shall be discharged from any further duties and obligations as Escrow Agent
under this Agreement upon delivery to such successor or assign of the Escrow
Agent of the then balance of the Escrowed Portion.

          (d) The Borrower and the Onshore Collateral Agent may replace the
Escrow Agent at any time by written notice to the Escrow Agent, provided that
the consent of the Borrower shall not be required upon a Borrower Event of
Default and while it is Continuing. Such replacement shall become effective when
a successor or assign of the Escrow Agent shall have been designated by the
Borrower and the Onshore Collateral Agent and shall have accepted such
designation in writing and when any and all fees payable by the Borrower to the
Escrow Agent hereunder shall have been paid in full. The Escrow Agent shall

the successor or assign of the Escrow Agent and shall deliver to such successor
or assign of the Escrow Agent the then balance of the Escrowed Portion.


                                                                               4

This instrument is executed under the terms and conditions stated below:

1.   PREAMBLE

1.1  The Shareholders are the major shareholders of Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde
     S.A.A. (the "Borrower"), jointly representing approximately 92.78% of the
     outstanding voting stock of the Borrower.

1.2  Sumitomo owns 73,511,763 SMCV Shares, BVN owns 63,833,717 SMCV Shares and
     Cyprus owns 187,500,306 SMCV Shares (collectively, the "Original Pledged
     Shares").

1.3  The Borrower has legal title over certain mining concessions granted by the
     pertinent Peruvian Governmental Authorities for the operation of the Cerro
     Verde copper mine, including a copper leaching and solution
     extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW) operation, located in the Districts of
     Uchumayo and Yarabamba, Province of Arequipa, Peru.

1.4  The board of directors of the Borrower has approved the development of a
     primary sulfide ore body beneath the oxide ore body currently in production
     (the "Sulfide Project"), for which purposes the Borrower intends to obtain
     financing in an
<PAGE>
     approximate amount of Four Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars of the United
     States of America (US$ 450,000,000.00);

1.5  The Borrower is entering into a Master Participation Agreement among the
     Borrower, the Senior Facility Lenders, the Lead JBIC Arrangers, the Global
     Coordinators, the Lead Arrangers and the Administrative Agent in order to
     set forth the general financing arrangement for the Sulfide Project.

1.6  The Borrower has entered into: (i) the JBIC Loan Agreement with JBIC; (ii)
     the KfW Loan Agreement with KfW; and (iii) the Commercial Banks Loan

     Bondholders acting through the Common Representative will, collectively,
     have all of the rights and obligations of a Senior Lender under the Master
     Security Agreement, including, without limitation, the right of the Common
     Representative, on behalf of the Peruvian Bondholders, to benefit as a
     Senior Lender from the security to be granted by the Borrower and the
     Shareholders, as the case may be, to the Secured Parties pursuant to the
     Master Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including,
     without limitation, the security interest created by this Agreement.

     the Shareholders to, on or prior to the Closing Date, create in favor of

     of the Pledged Shares (as defined herein).


                                                                               2

     to and under: (i) the Original Pledged Shares and (ii) any and all

     America (US$ 450,000,000.00), plus all applicable interest, expenses and

          may be payable to the Secured Parties pursuant to Section 4.1; and

     Collateral Agent, for the benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties,
     subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Security Agreement,
     undertakes to sign any and all documents and public deeds that may be
     required to reflect such reduction promptly upon the agreement of the
     Shareholders and the Onshore Collateral Agent. The Shareholders hereby

     to request any judge for the reduction of the Lien's Amount.

     the Civil Code to request any judge for the substitution of this pledge.

5.5  The Shareholders agree to, on or before the Closing Date, deliver and
     endorse for guaranty purposes to and in favor of the Onshore Collateral
     Agent, for the benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties, the

6.   INDIVISIBILITY OF THE COLLATERAL

6.1  This Agreement and the Pledged Shares subject thereto (as a whole or
     considering its individual parts) are indivisible and are intended to
     secure the full and timely payment or prepayment by the Borrower of the
     Secured Obligations.

6.2  Except to the extent set forth in Section 10, the first priority pledge
     created hereunder shall therefore remain in force and effect until the
     earlier of (i) all the Secured Obligations have been paid or repaid in
     full, even if the pledge and/or the lien created hereunder or under any and
     all amendments to this Agreement is divided or (ii) so long as the Senior
     Facility Loans Obligations have been paid or prepaid in full, the Borrower,
     with the consent of the Onshore Collateral Agent, seeks to terminate this
     Agreement as contemplated under Section 7.03 of the Peruvian Bonds
     Indenture. The Guaranty shall not be totally or partially released,
     discharged, removed or separated from this pledge, until all of the Secured
     Obligations have been paid or prepaid in full by the Borrower (in the case
     of clause (i)) or the Onshore Collateral Agent so consents (in the case of
     clause (ii)).

6.3  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Onshore Collateral Agent shall release
     certain Pledged Shares from this pledge and return the Certificates
     corresponding to such Pledged Shares to the owner thereof as set forth in
     Section 11(iii) to the extent that any of such Pledged Shares are sold,
     assigned, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of with the prior
     written consent of the Secured Parties or in a transaction that is a
     transfer that does not violate the terms of the Master Participation
     Agreement and the Transfer Restrictions Agreement.

7.   OBLIGATIONS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS

Each of the Shareholders undertakes the following:

(a)  Not to impose any Lien on the Pledged Shares, or execute any other

     interest, perfected in accordance with Peruvian law.

     representations and warranties to the Onshore Collateral Agent:

     accordance with the terms of the Master Security Agreement and the
     provisions contemplated in this Section 9.

9.2  Upon receipt by the Onshore Collateral Agent of an instruction from the

          an extra-stock exchange transaction ("operacion extra-bursatil"), as

          procedure in accordance with Article 720 et seq. of the Code of Civil
          Procedure, before the judges of the judicial district of Lima -
          Cercado.

          agreed to by the Parties, in which case for all purposes concerning
          the enforcement of the Guaranty through a judicial procedure as
          referred to in this Section 9.2(b) the aggregate value of the Pledged
          Shares shall be the aggregate value thereof as determined by such

     security for the timely and full payment or prepayment by the Borrower of
     the Secured Obligations.

3.2  This Industrial Pledge secures the Secured Obligations of the Borrower with
     the Secured Parties on a pari passu basis. Accordingly, all Secured Parties

     Section 12.

3.3  The Onshore Collateral Agent shall be the only party entitled to exercise
     any and all rights and prerogatives hereunder, including without limitation
     any Borrower Enforcement Action, and shall exercise such rights and
     prerogatives solely in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and
     the Master Security Agreement.

4.   LIEN'S AMOUNT

     principal amount is an amount not to exceed [Four Hundred and Fifty Million
     Dollars of the United States of America (US$ 450,000,000.00)], plus all
     applicable interest, expenses and fees as well as any and all costs and
     expenses ("costas y costos") in the event that the foreclosure of the
     Guaranty is necessary (the "Lien's Amount").

4.2  The Parties hereby agree that:

     (a)  the total amount secured by this Industrial Pledge shall include any
          amount which may be payable to the Secured Parties pursuant to Section

          the Master Security Agreement.

4.3  The Borrower and the Onshore Collateral Agent may agree, from time to time,
     subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Security Agreement, to
     reduce the Lien's Amount under this Industrial Pledge in accordance with

     resulting from such reduction fully covers its Secured Obligations.
     Accordingly, the Onshore Collateral Agent, for the benefit and on behalf of
     the Secured Parties, subject to the terms and conditions of the Master
     Security Agreement, undertakes to execute and deliver any and all documents
     and public deeds that may be required in order to reflect such reduction

          The Onshore Collateral Agent shall be entitled to exercise any and all
          rights, prerogatives and actions permitted by this Agreement, the
          Master Security Agreement or applicable Peruvian law.

          provided that such

          the enforcement of the Guaranty the aggregate value of the Goods and
          Assets shall be the aggregate value thereof as determined by such
          appraiser in such appraisal.

          If the Guaranty is foreclosed upon through a judicial procedure as
          referred to in Section 9.2(b), the equivalent of 2/3 of the above
          mentioned amount (as amended or appraised) shall serve as the basic
          value of the Goods and Assets for the first auction undertaken within
          such foreclosure proceeding, subsequently reducing said value,
          according to law, for any subsequent auctions, as the case may be.

consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of, exchange or surrender

release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms
thereof or of any agreement between the Trustee and the Borrower, without in any
way impairing or affecting its obligations pursuant hereto.

presentment, demand and any and all notices whatsoever in respect of the
Obligations and this Guarantee, and any requirement that the Trustee exhaust any
right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under the Financing
Documents.

     2.03 Pari passu.

     (a) The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee rank pari passu

     4.09 Consent to Jurisdiction.

     (a) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit
of the Trustee, that any legal action, suit or proceeding against it with
respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out
of or in connection with this Guarantee may be brought in any Federal or State
court located in New York County in the City of New York and hereby irrevocably
accepts and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such court with respect

objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of

further waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

     (b) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation in New York,
NY, as its authorized agent on which any and all legal process may be served in
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any Federal or State court
located in New York County in the City of New York. The Guarantor agrees that
service of process in respect of it upon such agent, together with written
notice of such service given to it in the manner provided in Section 4.07
hereof, shall be deemed to be effective service of process upon it in any such
action, suit or proceeding. The Guarantor agrees that the failure of such agent
to give notice to it of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity
of such service or any judgment rendered in any action, suit or proceeding based
thereon. If for any reason such agent shall cease to be available to act as
such, the Guarantor agrees to designate a new agent in New York County in the
City of New York, on the terms and for the purposes of this Section 4.09.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the ability of the Administrative Agent
or any Senior Facility Lender to serve any such legal process in any other
manner permitted by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Guarantor
or bring actions, suits or proceedings against them in such other jurisdictions,
and in such manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.

     4.10 No Trial by Jury. Each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     4.11 No Immunity. To the extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire
any immunity (sovereign or otherwise), from any legal action, suit or
proceedings, from jurisdiction of any court or from set-off or any legal process
(whether service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) with respect to
itself or any of its property, such party hereby irrevocably waives and agrees
not to plead or claim such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Guarantee or the subject matter hereof (including, without limitation, any
obligation for the payment of money). The parties hereby agree that the waivers
set forth in this Section 4.11 shall have the fullest effect permitted under the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United States, as amended, and
are intended to be irrevocable and not subject to withdrawal for purposes of
such Act. The foregoing waiver shall constitute a present waiver of immunity at
any time that any action is initiated against such party with respect to this
Guarantee.

irrespective of

          (i) the absence of any action to enforce the Guaranteed Obligations
     against the Borrower;


                                                                               2

          (v) the invalidation or unenforceability of the Guaranteed
     Obligations; or

          (vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal
     or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.

     (b) The Guarantor agrees that the Administrative Agent may at any time and
from time to time, either before or after the maturity thereof, without notice
to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of, exchange
or surrender collateral for, or renew any of the Guaranteed Obligations owed to
it, and may also make any agreement with the Guarantee Obligor, for the
extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole
or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement
between any Administrative Agent and the Guarantee Obligor, without in any way
impairing or affecting its obligations pursuant hereto.

     (c) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives diligence,
presentment, demand and any and all notices whatsoever in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations and this Guarantee, and any requirement that the
Administrative Agent exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the
Guarantee Obligor under the Financing Documents.

     2.04 Pari passu. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee rank
pari passu with all other unsecured indebtedness of the Guarantor.

located in New York County in the City of New York. The Guarantor agrees that
service of process in respect of it upon such agent, together with written

proceedings, from jurisdiction of any court or from set-off or any legal process
(whether service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) with respect to
itself or any of its property, such party hereby irrevocably waives and agrees
not to plead or claim such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
