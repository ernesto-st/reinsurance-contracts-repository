&#147;Plan&#148;) is to enable selected Employees and former senior Employees of CNA Financial Corporation
(the &#147;Company&#148;) or its subsidiaries (the &#147;Employers&#148;) to receive additional retirement benefits, to
compensate them for the limitations imposed upon their benefits under the CNA Employees Retirement
Plan (the &#147;Retirement Plan&#148;) in order to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
(the &#147;Code&#148;), and also to permit the Employers to provide additional benefits for other key
Employees and former Employees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <U>Effective Date</U>. Except as otherwise explicitly provided below, the rights of a
Participant whose employment terminated, or who otherwise became entitled to receive benefits,
under the Plan prior to January&nbsp;1, 2009, shall be determined under the terms of the Plan as in
effect at such time; provided that any provision of this amended and restated plan that is required
to be effective prior to such date in order for the Plan to comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code
shall be effective as of such prior date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 <U>Company and Employers</U>. The Plan is adopted for the benefit of selected Employees

participate in the Plan in such manner as the Administrator may determine. Each Employer is liable

Plan for securities laws purposes.

its sole discretion, determine at any time that any Employee or group of Employees described in the
preceding sentence shall no longer be eligible to participate; provided that such determination
shall not have the effect of reducing a Participant&#146;s benefit previously accrued under this Plan.

extent necessary or appropriate, any reference in this Plan to &#147;employment&#148; shall be modified and
interpreted in the case of a former Employee in a manner consistent with the intent of the Plan.

Section&nbsp;2.2(d). If such person was also eligible to participate in the Plan by reason of service
performed for an Employer after December&nbsp;31, 1997, the benefit accrued during such period of

have received from the Retirement Plan if neither of the Tax Limits applied over the Participant&#146;s
actual Retirement Plan benefit. The amount of the benefit the Participant would have received
under the Retirement Plan shall be determined on the same basis as the Participant&#146;s actual
Retirement Plan benefit, taking into account the Participant&#146;s age, compensation history, service,
and normal form of benefit under the Retirement Plan, but shall not be subject to any actuarial
adjustment solely by reason of the fact that the Participant retired after his normal retirement
age.

receive a benefit under this Plan equal to the greater of the balance in his SERP Accrued Pension
Account or the present value of the excess, if any, of the amount that would have been the
Participant&#146;s Accrued Benefit under the Retirement Plan as of December&nbsp;31, 1999 if neither of the
Tax Limits applied over the Participant&#146;s actual Accrued Benefit under the Retirement Plan on such
date. The SERP Accrued Pension Account of each Choice 2 Participant was initially established as
of December&nbsp;31, 1999, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount of the Accrued
Pension Account that would have been established for such Participant under the Retirement Plan if
his accrued benefit had not been subject to either of the Tax Limits, and such SERP Accrued Pension
Account shall be credited with interest not less often than annually at the rate, and in the

case of a Choice 2 Participant who was an Employee of RSKCO Claims Services, Inc., December&nbsp;31,
1998, shall be substituted for December&nbsp;31, 1999, in both of the preceding sentences.

Agreement shall be determined as provided in the applicable SERP Agreement. In general, it is
intended that SERP Agreements shall provide such Participants with benefits computed in the manner
provided in the Retirement Plan, but which cannot be provided under the Retirement Plan for reasons
other than the Tax Limits. By way of illustration and not limitation, a SERP Agreement may provide
for a Participant hired after December&nbsp;31, 1999, to receive a benefit computed as if he were a
participant in the Retirement Plan, or may provide for a Participant to receive a supplemental
benefit determined as if he were credited with additional service under the Retirement Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;A Participant who is a participant by reason of having participated in the CIC SERP as
described in Section&nbsp;2.1(d) shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the excess of the amount of the
Frozen CIC Benefit, as defined in Appendix&nbsp;D of the Retirement Plan, to which the participant would
be entitled if the Frozen CIC Benefit were determined without application of the Tax Limits, over
the Participant&#146;s actual Frozen CIC Benefit, reduced by any benefit actually paid to the
Participant under the CIC SERP. The benefit of a Participant who also participated in the Deferred
Compensation Plan of The Continental Company and/or the Supplemental Savings Plan of The
Continental Company shall also be increased by the amount by which his Frozen CIC Benefit would
have been increased had the amount of compensation deferred under such plans been included in the
calculation his Frozen CIC Benefit, as provided in the CIC SERP. To the extent that compensation
records from The Continental Corporation are not available, the Administrator shall use
commercially reasonable methods to estimate the amount of the Participant&#146;s benefit based upon the
records available, and shall not be liable to the Participant for any additional amount.

vested; provided, however, that an event that results in the Retirement Plan benefits of a group of
Participants being vested without regard to their years of service, including but not limited to
the sale of a business unit or a determination that a partial termination of the Retirement Plan

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in a SERP Agreement, the Post-2004 portion of a Participant&#146;s
benefit under this Plan shall be paid in a single lump sum equal to the actuarial equivalent of
such portion as soon as practicable after the date the Participant terminates employment; provided
that if the sum of the Participant&#146;s Rule of 65 Service (as defined under the terms of the
Retirement Plan as in effect on April&nbsp;1, 2008) and age on the termination date do not equal at
least 65, it shall be paid on the later of the date the Participant terminates employment or the
date he reaches either age 55 if he had completed at least 10&nbsp;years of Rule of 65 Service on the
termination date, or age 65 if he had not completed 10&nbsp;years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding paragraph (a), payment of the benefit of a Participant who terminated
employment prior to April&nbsp;1, 2008, and whose benefit payment date as determined under paragraph (a)
would have already been reached on such date (a &#147;transitional Participant&#148;), shall commence on June
1, 2009. The total benefit of a transitional Participant (including the Pre-2005 portion as
described in paragraph (c), shall be paid in a single lump sum on June&nbsp;1, 2009, if the present
value of the benefit, calculated as of April&nbsp;1, 2009, using the actuarial assumptions provided in
the Retirement Plan (the &#147;lump sum value&#148;) does not exceed $100,000.00. If the lump sum value
exceeds $100,000.00, then three equal installments shall be paid on each of June&nbsp;1, 2009, June&nbsp;1,
2010, and June&nbsp;1, 2011, calculated so that the present value of the three installments as of April
1, 2009, using the applicable interest rate specified in the Retirement Plan but no mortality
assumption, equals the lump sum value. If the Participant dies before all three installments have
been paid, the remaining installments shall be paid at the same time to the Participant&#146;s
Beneficiary. If the Participant was a Choice 1 Participant not otherwise permitted to designate a
Beneficiary, the Administrator may permit the Participant to designate a Beneficiary for this
purpose, and otherwise the benefit shall be paid to the Participant&#146;s surviving spouse, if any, and
otherwise to the Participant&#146;s estate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Pre-2005 portion of a Participant&#146;s benefit shall be paid in the same manner as his
Retirement Plan benefit, provided that the Administrator may elect to pay the Pre-2005 portion of
the benefit of a Choice 1 Participant (as hereinafter defined) in a single lump sum equal to the
actuarial equivalent of the Pre-2005 portion, and may also decide to pay the Pre-2005 portion of a
Choice 2 Participant in any of the forms of annuity available under the Retirement Plan that are
actuarially equivalent. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Administrator has elected to pay the Pre-2005
portion of all benefits in the form of a lump sum paid at the same time that the Post-2004 portion
is payable pursuant to paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b), but the Administrator may pay any or all Pre-2005
portions that would otherwise be payable in a lump sum in the form of a monthly annuity. All
determinations by the Administrator as to the form of payment shall be made by the Administrator in
its sole and absolute discretion, which may be exercised in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and
in no event shall any Participant be considered to have a vested interest in the payment of the
Pre-2005 Portion of his benefit in any particular form. Actuarial equivalence shall be determined
in accordance with the applicable actuarial assumptions provided under the Retirement Plan.
Payment of a Participant&#146;s benefit in the form of a lump sum shall fully discharge all amounts owed
to the Participant and to his heirs or beneficiaries under the Plan.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 <U>Source of Payment</U>. All payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made directly
from the general funds of the Participant&#146;s Employer. Each Employer shall establish separate
bookkeeping accounts to reflect its liability under the Plan and may, but shall not be obligated
to, invest in insurance or annuity contracts or other assets to assure a source of funds for the
payment of benefits, but any such bookkeeping account, insurance or annuity contracts, or other
investment shall constitute assets solely of such Employer, and Participants shall have no right,
title or interest therein prior to payment of their benefits hereunder. The right of any
Participant or other person to receive benefit payments under the provisions of this Plan shall be
no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Participant&#146;s Employer. This
Plan shall not create nor be construed to create a trust or fiduciary relationship in favor of any
person whatsoever.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 <U>Establishment of Trust</U>. The Company may, but shall in no event be required to,
establish one or more trusts and contribute, or cause Employers to contribute, amounts to such
trusts to be used for the payment of benefits under this Plan. Any such trust shall be of the type
commonly referred to as a &#147;rabbi trust&#148;, and the Company or Employer shall be treated as the owner
of the assets of such trust for tax purposes in accordance with &#167;671-&#167;678 of the Code. The assets
of any such trust shall remain subject to the claims of creditors of the Company or the Employer
contributing such assets, and no Participant or any other person shall have any beneficial interest
in or other claim to the assets of any such trust beyond that of a general creditor as provided in
Section&nbsp;3.1. Any payments made to or on behalf of a Participant or Beneficiary from any such trust
shall fully discharge the liability of the Company or Employer to such Participant or Beneficiary
under the Plan to the extent of the amount so paid. The Administrator shall have the right to
select, remove, and replace the trustee thereof at any time in its sole discretion, and shall enter
into one or more agreements governing such trust containing such terms as it determines, and may
modify, amend or revoke any such agreements, all in its sole discretion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3 <U>Withholding and Payroll Taxes</U>. The Administrator shall withhold, or shall direct
the person making any payment to withhold, from payments made hereunder any taxes required to be
withheld from a Participant&#146;s wages for the federal or any state or local government. To the
extent that benefits hereunder are subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or
any other law prior to the time that they become payable, the Administrator may withhold, or direct
the Participant&#146;s Employer to withhold, the amount of such taxes from any other compensation or
other amounts payable to the Participant. The Administrator&#146;s determination of the amount to be so
withheld shall be final and binding on all parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4 <U>Payment on Behalf of Disabled or Incompetent Persons</U>. If a Plan benefit is
payable to a minor or a person declared incompetent or to a person whom the Administrator, in its
sole discretion, determines to be incapable of handling the disposition of property, the
Administrator may direct payment of such Plan benefit to the guardian, legal representative or
person having the care and custody of such minor or incompetent person, or to any other person,
including any family member, whom the Administrator determines in its sole discretion to be

benefit.

any Participant, beneficiary or other person entitled to benefits under this Plan, the
Administrator may, in its sole discretion, either cause all or a portion of such payment to be
forfeited and to reduce its obligations under this Plan, or may pay all or a portion of such
benefit to members of the missing person&#146;s family or such other person as it may determine in its
sole discretion to be fair and equitable. Any payment made pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.5 shall

benefit under this Plan by virtue of his relationship to a Participant or Beneficiary (the
&#147;Claimant&#148;), who believes that he has the right to a benefit that has not been paid, must file a
written claim for such benefit in accordance with the procedures established by the Administrator.
All such claims shall be filed not more than one year after the Claimant knows, or with the
exercise of reasonable diligence would have known, of the basis for such claim. The preceding
sentence shall not be construed to require a Participant or Beneficiary to file a formal claim for
the payment of undisputed benefits in the normal course, but any claim that relates to the amount
of any benefit shall in any event be filed not more than one year after payment of such benefit
commences. The Administrator may retain third party administrators and recordkeepers for the
purpose of processing routine matters relating to the payment of benefits, but correspondence
between a Participant, Beneficiary or other person and such third parties shall not be considered
claims for purposes of this Section, and a person shall not be considered a Claimant until he has

the claim and explains why such material or information is necessary, and explains the claim review
procedures of this Section&nbsp;4.4, and the Claimant&#146;s right to bring an action under &#167;502 of ERISA,

fiduciary as the Administrator may appoint for such purpose) shall review such decision. The
Operations Committee&#146;s decision on review shall be in writing and furnished not more than five days
after the meeting at which the review is completed, and shall include specific reasons for the
decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, shall include specific
references to the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based, and shall advise
the Claimant of his right to bring an action under &#167;502 of ERISA, subject to the limitations of

meeting that is held at least 30&nbsp;days after the request for review is received. If special
circumstances require, the decision may be made by the Operations Committee not later than its
third meeting held after the request for review is received, in which event the Claimant shall be
notified of the reason for the delay not later than five days after the meeting at which the review
would otherwise have been completed, which notice shall explain the reason for the delay and
include an estimate of the time at which the review will be complete. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time the Operations Committee (or any other fiduciary designated to review
appeals) is not scheduled to meet at least quarterly, the decision on review shall be delivered to
the Claimant not more than 60&nbsp;days after the request for review is received, which may be extended
to not more than 120&nbsp;days if special circumstances require and the notice of extension described
above is furnished by the end of the initial 60&nbsp;day period.

the claim and appeal rights herein provided have been exercised and the Plan benefits requested in
such claim and appeal have been denied in whole or in part. After exhaustion of the Plan&#146;s claim
procedures, any further legal action taken against the Plan or its fiduciaries by a claimant must
be filed in a court of law no later than 120&nbsp;days after the final adverse benefit determination of
the Operations Committee (or other final appeals fiduciary) is communicated to the claimant or his
or her legal representative, notwithstanding any other statute of limitations. In the event a
claimant wishes to bring a legal action against the Plan or one of its fiduciaries, such legal
action must be filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
(Eastern Division) and shall be governed by the procedural and substantive laws of the State of
Illinois, to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA, notwithstanding any conflict of laws
principles.
