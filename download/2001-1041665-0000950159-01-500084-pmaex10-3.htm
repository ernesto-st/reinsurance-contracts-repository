     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
place limitations (the &#147;Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 Limitations&#148;) on
the retirement benefits which can be paid to participants in the PMA Capital
Corporation Pension Plan (formerly known as The PMC Pension Plan (the
&#147;Pension Plan&#148;); and </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
some executives hired in mid-career by PMA Capital Corporation (formerly known
as the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Corporation) (the &#147;Plan Sponsor&#148;)
are not able to be credited with the maximum number of years of Benefit Service
allowable under the Pension Plan (&#147;Short Service Reduction&#148;); and </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
the Plan Sponsor established the <B>PMA Capital Corporation Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan </B>(formerly known as The PMC Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan) (the &#147;Plan&#148;) to provide supplemental executive
retirement benefits for the purposes of offsetting the Sections 401(a)(17) and
415 Limitations and the Short Service Reduction to a select group of management
and highly compensated employees within the meaning of Section 201(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;);
and </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
the Plan Sponsor has decided to provide to a select group of management and
highly compensated employees within the meaning of Section 201(2) of ERISA the
Short Service Reduction benefits previously provided under the Plan in a
separate plan to be known as the PMA Capital Corporation Executive Management
Pension Plan (the &#147;EMPP&#148;); and </P>

retirement before he/she is eligible for retirement benefits under the Federal
Social Security system (as such optional form is described in Section 7.2 of the

other than Cause, or if the Participant shall terminate employment for Good
Reason or retirement, death, or total disability (as defined in the Pension

the Participant&#146;s Excess Retirement Benefit determined as of the date
Participant&#146;s employment terminated, <I>i.e.</I>, if the termination date
is on or after the Normal Retirement Date then the Excess Retirement Benefit
will be determined under Section 2.1(a), if the termination date is on or after
the Early Retirement Date but before the Normal Retirement Date, then under
Section 2.1(b) and if prior to the Early Retirement Date, then under Section
2.1(c). The Participant&#146;s Excess Retirement Benefit under this provision
shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum upon such termination of
employment by the Participating Company (or any successor corporation) in cash
