Secured Parties (other than the Administrative Agent) agrees that the
Administrative Agent shall be the joint creditor (together with the relevant
Secured Parties) of each and every obligation of any Borrower towards each of
the Secured Parties (other than the Administrative Agent) under the Loan
Documents. Accordingly the Administrative Agent will have its own independent
right to demand performance by the relevant Borrower of those obligations.

extent, discharge the corresponding obligation owing to the other; and</font></p>

9.15</u> or under any other provision of the Loan Documents), the

exercise its rights as a joint creditor with a Secured Party (other than the
Administrative Agent) except with the consent of the relevant Secured Party.
However, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the previous sentence shall in
any way limit the Administrative Agent&#146;s right to act in the protection or
preservation of rights under, or to enforce any Security Agreement as
contemplated by, this Agreement and/or the relevant Security Agreement (or to
do any act reasonably incidental to any of the foregoing).</font></p>
