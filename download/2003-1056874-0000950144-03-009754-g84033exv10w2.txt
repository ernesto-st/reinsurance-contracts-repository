                          SECTION 1. CREDIT FACILITIES

                  Subject to the terms and conditions of, and in reliance upon
the representations and warranties made in, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, (A) Revolving Credit Lenders agree to make a revolving credit
facility of up to $200,000,000 (the "Revolving Credit Facility") available upon
Borrower Representative's request therefor, and (B) Term Loan B Lenders agree to
make a $65,000,000 Term Loan B (the "Term Loan B") to Borrowers on the Closing
Date, in each case as follows:

1.1. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

         1.1.1. REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees,
severally and not jointly, for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists,
to make loans (such loans relative to such Revolving Lender, its "Revolving
Credit Loans") to Borrowers from time to time during the period from the date
hereof to but not including the last day of the Term, as requested by Borrower
Representative in the manner set forth in subsection 3.1.1 hereof up to a
maximum principal amount at any time outstanding equal to the lesser of (i) such
Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, minus the product of such
Revolving Credit Lender's Percentage times the sum of the LC and Acceptance



<PAGE>

Amount, the then outstanding Swing Line Loans and any reserves then in place and
(ii) the product of such Revolving Credit Lender's Percentage times an amount
equal to the Borrowing Base at such time minus the LC and Acceptance Amount
minus the then outstanding Swing Line Loans minus any reserves then in place.
The initial Revolving Credit Commitments are set forth on Exhibit 1.1 hereto.
Administrative Agent shall have the right to establish reserves in such amounts
and with respect to such matters, as Administrative Agent shall deem necessary
or appropriate in its reasonable credit judgment, against the amount of
Revolving Credit Loans which Borrowers may otherwise request under this
subsection 1.1.1 upon prior written notice to Borrower Representative, including
without limitation, with respect to (i) price adjustments, damages, unearned
discounts, returned products or other matters for which credit memoranda are
issued in the ordinary course of Borrowers' business; (ii) Dilution Reserves;
(iii) shrinkage, spoilage and obsolescence of Borrowers' Inventory; (iv) slow
moving Inventory; (v) other sums chargeable against Borrowers' Revolving Credit
Loan Account as Revolving Credit Loans under any section of this Agreement; (vi)
amounts owing by Borrowers to any Person to the extent secured by a Lien on, or
trust over, any Property of Borrowers; (vii) amounts owing by Borrowers in
connection with Product Obligations; (viii) mandatory prepayments or
amortization payments of the Term Loan B which cannot be made due to the failure
to meet any of the applicable Blocking Provisions, which reserves shall be
established in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and (ix) such
other specific events, conditions or contingencies as to which Administrative
Agent, in its reasonable credit judgment, determines reserves should be
established from time to time hereunder. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be
repayable in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and shall be secured by
all of the Collateral. Revolving Credit Loans may be borrowed as Base Rate Loans
or LIBOR Loans. Amounts borrowed under this subsection 1.1.1 may be repaid in
whole or in part and, up to but excluding the last day of the Term, reborrowed,
all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

         1.1.2. SWING LINE LOANS. In order to reduce the frequency of transfers
of funds from Revolving Credit Lenders to Administrative Agent for making
Revolving Credit Loans and for so long as no Default or Event of Default exists,
Administrative Agent shall be permitted (but not required) to make loans to
Borrowers upon request by Borrower Representative (such loans to be designated
as "Swing Line Loans"); PROVIDED, that the aggregate principal amount of Swing
Line Loans outstanding at any time will not (i) exceed $10,000,000; (ii) when
added to the principal amount of Administrative Agent's other Revolving Credit
Loans then outstanding plus Administrative Agent's Percentage of the LC and
Acceptance Amount, exceed Administrative Agent's Revolving Credit Commitment; or
(iii) when added to the principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans then
outstanding plus the LC and Acceptance Amount, exceed the Borrowing Base, less
the aggregate amount of reserves established with respect thereto. Within the
foregoing limits, Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Line Loans.
Swing Line Loans may only be borrowed as Base Rate Loans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, not more than 2 Business Days after (1) Revolving Credit Lenders
receive notice from Administrative Agent that a Swing Line Loan has been
advanced in respect of a drawing under a Letter of Credit or LC and Acceptance
Guaranty or maturity of an Acceptance or (2) in any other circumstance, demand
is made by Administrative Agent during the continuance of an Event of Default,



                                       2
<PAGE>

each Revolving Credit Lender shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase and
receive from the Administrative Agent, without recourse or warranty from
Administrative Agent, an undivided interest and participation in each Swing Line
Loan to the extent of such Revolving Credit Lender's Percentage thereof, by
paying to the Administrative Agent, in same day funds, an amount equal to such
Revolving Credit Lender's Percentage of such Swing Line Loan.

         1.1.3. OVERADVANCES. Insofar as Borrower Representative may request,
and Administrative Agent or Majority Revolving Credit Lenders (as provided
below) may be willing in their sole and absolute discretion to make, Revolving
Credit Loans to Borrowers at a time when the unpaid balance of Revolving Credit
Loans and Swing Line Loans plus the sum of the LC and Acceptance Amount plus the
amount of LC and Acceptance Obligations that have not been reimbursed by
Borrowers or funded with a Revolving Credit Loan, plus reserves, exceeds, or
would exceed with the making of any such Revolving Credit Loan, the Borrowing
Base, whether or not a Default or Event of Default shall then have occurred and
be continuing (any such Loan being herein referred to as an "Overadvance"),
Administrative Agent shall enter such Overadvances as debits in the Revolving
Credit Loan Account; provided, that, Majority Revolving Credit Lenders may at
any time revoke Administrative Agent's authorization to make Overadvances. The
principal amount of Overadvances outstanding at any time, when aggregated with
the then outstanding principal amount of Administrative Agent Loans (as
hereafter defined), shall not at any time exceed the lesser of (x) 5% of the
then Borrowing Base and (y) $10,000,000 (the "Overadvance Limit"). All
Overadvances shall be repaid on demand, shall be secured by the Collateral and
shall bear interest as provided in this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Any
Overadvance made pursuant to the terms hereof shall be made by all Revolving
Credit Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Percentages.
Overadvances, if any, in an aggregate amount in excess of the Overadvance Limit
shall require the consent of all Lenders. The foregoing notwithstanding, in no
event, unless otherwise consented to by all Revolving Credit Lenders, (x) shall
any Overadvances be outstanding for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, (y)
after all outstanding Overadvances have been repaid, shall Administrative Agent
or Revolving Credit Lenders make any additional Overadvances unless thirty (30)
days or more have expired since the last date on which any Overadvances were
outstanding, or (z) shall Administrative Agent make Revolving Credit Loans on
behalf of Revolving Credit Lenders under this subsection 1.1.3 to the extent
such Revolving Credit Loans would cause a Revolving Credit Lender's share of the
Revolving Credit Loans to exceed such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit
Commitment minus such Revolving Credit Lender's Percentage of the LC and
Acceptance Amount and the then outstanding Swing Line Loans.

         1.1.4. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT LOANS. Administrative Agent, in its sole
discretion, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default shall then have
occurred and be continuing, may make Revolving Credit Loans on behalf of
Revolving Credit Lenders, if Administrative Agent, in its reasonable business
judgment, deems that such Revolving Credit Loans are necessary or desirable (i)
to protect all or any portion of the Collateral, (ii) to enhance the likelihood,
or maximize the amount, of repayment of the Loans and the other Obligations, or
(iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to Borrowers pursuant to this
Agreement, including without limitation costs, fees and expenses as described in
Sections 2.8 and 2.9 (any such Loan being herein referred to as an
"Administrative Agent Loan"); provided, that (a) the principal amount of
Administrative Agent Loans outstanding at any time, when aggregated with the
then outstanding principal amount of Overadvances, shall not at any time exceed
the Overadvance Limit, (b) the sum of the maximum principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans plus the LC and Acceptance Amount plus Swing Line Loans



                                       3
<PAGE>

then outstanding shall not at any time exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit
Commitments and (c) Majority Revolving Credit Lenders may at any time revoke
Administrative Agent's authorization to make Administrative Agent Loans. Any
such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon
Administrative Agent's receipt thereof. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall be
obligated to advance its Percentage of each Administrative Agent Loan. If
Administrative Agent Loans are made pursuant to this subsection 1.1.4, then (i)
the Borrowing Base shall be deemed increased by the amount of such permitted
Administrative Agent Loans, but only for so long as Administrative Agent allows
such Administrative Agent Loans to be outstanding, and (ii) all Revolving Credit
Lenders that have committed to make Revolving Credit Loans shall be bound to
make, or permit to remain outstanding, such Administrative Agent Loans based
upon their Percentages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

1.2. LETTERS OF CREDIT AND ACCEPTANCES.

         1.2.1. LETTERS OF CREDIT; ACCEPTANCES; LC AND ACCEPTANCE GUARANTIES.
Administrative Agent agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of Default
exists and if requested by Borrower Representative, to (i) issue its, or cause
to be issued by Issuing Bank or another Affiliate of Administrative Agent, on
the date requested by Borrower Representative, Letters of Credit for the account
of a Borrower or (ii) execute LC and Acceptance Guaranties by which
Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank, or another Affiliate of Administrative
Agent, on the date requested by Borrower Representative, shall guaranty the
payment or performance by a Borrower of its reimbursement obligations with
respect to letters of credit or (iii) cause an Acceptance to be created under a
Letter of Credit; provided that the LC and Acceptance Amount shall not exceed
$70,000,000 at any time (such amount, the "LC and Acceptance Sub-Limit");
provided, further, that, the LC and Acceptance Amount shall not at any time
exceed the Borrowing Base at such time minus the then outstanding Revolving
Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans minus any reserves then in place. No Letter of
Credit, Acceptance or LC and Acceptance Guaranty may have an expiration date
later than 5 Business Days prior to the end of the Term. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Borrowers, Administrative Agent and
Revolving Credit Lenders hereby agree that all LC and Acceptance Obligations and
all obligations of Borrowers relating thereto shall be satisfied by the prompt
issuance of one or more Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans, which
Borrowers hereby acknowledge are requested and Revolving Credit Lenders hereby
agree to fund. In the event that Revolving Credit Loans are not, for any reason,
promptly made to satisfy all then existing LC and Acceptance Obligations, each
Revolving Credit Lender hereby agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, on demand,
an amount equal to such LC and Acceptance Obligations multiplied by such
Revolving Credit Lender's Percentage, and until so paid, such amount shall be
secured by the Collateral and shall bear interest and be payable at the same
rate and in the same manner as Base Rate Loans. Immediately upon the issuance of
a Letter of Credit, Acceptance or an LC and Acceptance Guaranty under this
Agreement, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and
unconditionally purchased and received from Administrative Agent, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation therein equal to
such LC and Acceptance Obligations multiplied by such Revolving Credit Lender's
Percentage.

         1.2.2. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS.

                  (a) Borrowers agree to reimburse (i) Issuing Bank (through the
         Administrative Agent) for any draw under any Letter of Credit or upon
         the maturity date of any Acceptance and (ii) Administrative Agent for
         any payment made under any LC and Acceptance Guaranty, in each
         instance, immediately upon any such drawing, maturity or payment, and
         to pay Issuing Bank (through Administrative Agent) or Administrative
         Agent, as the case may be, the amount of all other obligations and
         other amounts payable to Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent under or
         in connection with any Letter of Credit, Acceptance or LC and
         Acceptance Guaranty immediately when due, irrespective of any claim,
         setoff, defense or other right which Borrowers may have at any time
         against such issuer or any other Person; PROVIDED, that if Issuing Bank
         (through Administrative Agent) or Administrative Agent, as the case may
         be, shall notify the Borrower Representative of a drawing, maturity or
         payment after 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of any drawing
         under a Letter of Credit, maturity of an Acceptance or payment under a
         LC and Acceptance Guaranty (as appropriate), Borrowers will not be
         required to reimburse Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent, as the case
         may be, until the next Business Day and, until such reimbursement is so
         required, the amount of such drawing or payment shall be deemed to be a
         Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan hereunder in accordance
         with the provisions of paragraph (c) below. Each such payment shall be
         made to Administrative Agent (for the account of Issuing Bank or
         Administrative Agent, as the case may be) at its address for notices
         specified herein.

                  (b) Interest shall be payable on any and all amounts remaining
         unpaid by Borrowers under this subsection from the date such amounts
         become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
         otherwise) until payment in full at the per annum rate which is 2%
         above the rate payable with respect to Base Rate Loans from time to
         time.

                  (c) Each notice of a drawing under any Letter of Credit,
         maturity of an Acceptance or a payment under any LC and Acceptance
         Guaranty shall constitute a request by Borrowers for a borrowing
         pursuant to subsection 1.1.1 of Revolving Credit Loans which are Base
         Rate Loans in the amount of such drawing, maturity or payment, as the
         case may be, plus any amounts payable pursuant to subsection 1.2.2(a)
         in respect of such drawing, maturity or payment. The borrowing date
         with respect to such borrowing shall be the date of such drawing,
         maturity or payment, as the case may be.

                  (d) Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt
         thereof, distribute to Issuing Bank or Revolving Credit Lenders, as the
         case may be, all amounts received by Administrative Agent for the
         account of Issuing Bank or Revolving Credit Lenders, as the case may
         be, pursuant to this subsection.

         1.2.3. LC AND ACCEPTANCE PARTICIPATIONS.

                  (a) To induce Administrative Agent to (i) cause Issuing Bank
         to issue Letters of Credit and accept Acceptances hereunder and (ii)
         enter into LC and Acceptance Guaranties with respect to Letters of
         Credit and Acceptances, each Revolving Credit Lender (an "LC and
         Acceptance Participant") irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and
         hereby accepts and purchases, on the terms and conditions hereinafter
         stated, for such LC and Acceptance Participant's own



                                       5
<PAGE>
         account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such LC and Acceptance
         Participant's Percentage in Administrative Agent's obligations and
         rights under each LC and Acceptance Guaranty issued in connection with
         any Letter of Credit and Acceptance and in Issuing Bank's obligations
         and rights under each Letter of Credit and Acceptance. Each LC and
         Acceptance Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with
         Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, as the case may be, that it
         shall be directly and unconditionally obligated to Administrative Agent
         or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to reimburse Administrative Agent
         or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, upon demand and without setoff or
         deduction of any kind or nature, for making any payment under any LC
         and Acceptance Guaranty, Acceptance or Letter of Credit, as the case
         may be, in an amount equal to such LC and Acceptance Participant's
         Percentage multiplied by the amount of such payment made by
         Administrative Agent under such LC and Acceptance Guaranty or Issuing
         Bank under such Letter of Credit or Acceptance, as the case may be.
         Each such reimbursement shall be made to Administrative Agent (for
         account of the Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent, as the case may
         be) at its address for notices specified herein.

                  (b) If any amount required to be paid by any LC and Acceptance
         Participant to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 1.2.3(a) in
         respect of any payment made by Administrative Agent under any LC and
         Acceptance Guaranty is not paid to Administrative Agent on the date
         such payment is due from such LC and Acceptance Participant, such LC
         and Acceptance Participant shall pay to Administrative Agent on demand
         an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily
         average Federal Funds Rate, as quoted by Administrative Agent, during
         the period from and including the date such payment is required to the
         date on which such payment is immediately available to Administrative
         Agent, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
         days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is
         360. A certificate of Administrative Agent submitted to any LC and
         Acceptance Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this
         subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  (c) Whenever, at any time after Administrative Agent has made
         payment under any LC and Acceptance Guaranty and has received from any
         LC and Acceptance Participant its pro rata share of such payment in
         accordance with subsection 1.2.3(a), Administrative Agent receives any
         payment from Borrowers on account of reimbursement obligations in
         respect of such payment under such LC and Acceptance Guaranty (whether
         directly from Borrowers or otherwise, including by way of set-off or
         proceeds of collateral applied thereto by Administrative Agent), or any
         payment of interest on account thereof, Administrative Agent shall
         distribute to such LC and Acceptance Participant its pro rata share
         thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that any such payment
         received by Administrative Agent shall be required to be returned by
         Administrative Agent, such LC and Acceptance Participant shall return
         to Administrative Agent the portion thereof previously distributed by
         Administrative Agent to it.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Revolving Credit Lender
         shall be required to purchase a participating interest in
         Administrative Agent's



                                       6
<PAGE>
         obligations and rights under a LC and Acceptance Guaranty if, prior to
         the issuance by Administrative Agent of such LC and Acceptance
         Guaranty, Administrative Agent has received written notice from such
         Revolving Credit Lender specifying that such Revolving Credit Lender
         believes in good faith that an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, describing the nature of such Event of Default and stating
         that, as a result thereof, such Revolving Credit Lender shall cease to
         purchase such participating interests; PROVIDED, that the obligation of
         such Revolving Credit Lender to purchase such participating interests
         shall be reinstated upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date upon
         which such Revolving Credit Lender notifies Administrative Agent that
         its prior notice has been withdrawn and (ii) the date upon which the
         Event of Default specified in such notice no longer is continuing (it
         being understood that, in the event that such Event of Default was not
         continuing at the time that Administrative Agent received such notice,
         such Revolving Credit Lender shall be obligated to purchase such
         participating interest promptly upon discovery that its good faith
         belief was erroneous).

         1.2.4. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.

                  (a) The obligations of each LC and Acceptance Participant to
         make payments to Administrative Agent with respect to its participation
         in any LC and Acceptance Guaranty, to Issuing Bank with respect to its
         participation in any Letter of Credit or Acceptance and the obligations
         of Borrowers under this subsection 1.2 shall be absolute and
         unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any
         set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any LC and Acceptance
         Participant or Borrowers may have or have had against Administrative
         Agent, Issuing Bank or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit.

                  (b) Borrowers hereby agree with Administrative Agent on behalf
         of Issuing Bank and itself that neither Issuing Bank nor Administrative
         Agent shall be responsible for, and Borrowers' reimbursement
         obligations under subsection 1.2.2 shall not be affected by, among
         other things, (i) the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
         endorsements thereon, even though such documents or endorsements shall
         in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged; PROVIDED, that, in
         respect of reimbursement obligations owing to Issuing Bank relating to
         a drawing under a Letter of Credit made with such documents or
         endorsements, reliance upon such documents or endorsements by Issuing
         Bank shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct
         of Issuing Bank or (ii) any dispute between or among Borrowers and any
         beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such
         Letter of Credit may be transferred or (iii) any claims whatsoever of
         Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries against any
         beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.

                  (c) Neither Issuing Bank nor Administrative Agent shall be
         liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
         dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in
         connection with any Letter of Credit issued by Issuing Bank, except, in
         the case of Issuing Bank, for errors or omissions caused by Issuing
         Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Borrowers agree that any action taken or omitted by
         Issuing Bank or by Administrative Agent on behalf of Issuing Bank under
         or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by Issuing Bank or
         the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross
         negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the standards
         of care specified in the UCP shall be binding on Borrowers and shall
         not result in any liability on the part of Issuing Bank or
         Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to the Borrowers or any of
         their respective Subsidiaries.

                  (e) If any draft shall be presented for payment or acceptance
         to Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit issued by it, Administrative
         Agent shall cause Issuing Bank to notify Borrower Representative
         thereof in accordance with the provisions of the UCP. The
         responsibility of Issuing Bank to Borrowers in connection with any
         draft presented for payment and acceptance under any Letter of Credit
         issued by Issuing Bank shall, in addition to any payment or acceptance
         obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited
         to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered
         under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in
         compliance with such Letter of Credit.

         1.2.5. APPLICATION. To the extent that any provision of any application
related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this
subsection 1.2, the provisions of this subsection 1.2 shall apply.

1.3. TERM LOAN B. Each Term Loan B Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees to
make its portion of the Term Loan B to Borrowers on the Closing Date, in the
aggregate principal amount of such Term Loan B Lender's Term Loan B Commitment.
Amounts repaid after the Closing Date on the Term Loan B shall not be
reborrowed.

1.4. USE OF PROCEEDS. The Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Loans borrowed on
the Closing Date shall be used solely for the repayment of existing Indebtedness
of Borrowers and the other Loan Parties and to pay related fees and expenses
(including any premiums payable in connection with the repayment of existing
Indebtedness). Revolving Credit Loans made after the Closing Date shall be used
solely for Borrowers' working capital needs and general corporate purposes in a
manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and all applicable laws.

<PAGE>

                  (b) If Borrower Representative exercises the LIBOR Option as
         provided in Section 3.1 with respect to all or a portion of the
         Revolving Credit Loans, interest shall accrue on the principal amount
         of Revolving Credit Loans that are LIBOR Loans outstanding at the end
         of each day at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in
         effect plus the LIBOR applicable to each LIBOR Loan for the
         corresponding Interest Period.

         2.1.2. TERM LOAN B. Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of
the Term Loan B outstanding at the end of each day at a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the Term Loan B Base Rate plus five percent (5.00%). Such rate of
interest shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to any increase or
decrease in the Term Loan B Base Rate, effective as of the opening of business
on the day that any such change in the Term Loan B Base Rate occurs

         2.1.3. DEFAULT RATE OF INTEREST. At the option of Administrative Agent
or the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders, upon and after the occurrence of an
Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the principal amount of

plus the interest rate otherwise applicable thereto and the Letter of Credit,
Acceptance and LC and Acceptance Guaranty fee described in subsection 2.4.1
otherwise then in effect shall be increased by 2.0%. At the option of Term Loan
B Agent or the Majority Term Loan B Lenders, upon and after the occurrence of an

all amounts deemed interest hereunder or under the Notes and charged or
collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to the Notes
exceed the highest rate permissible under any law which a court of competent
jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. If any
provisions of this Agreement or the Notes are in contravention of any such law,
such provisions shall be deemed amended to conform thereto (the "Maximum Rate").
If at any time, the amount of interest paid hereunder is limited by the Maximum
Rate, and the amount at which interest accrues hereunder is subsequently below
the Maximum Rate, the rate at which interest accrues hereunder shall remain at
the Maximum Rate, until such time as the aggregate interest paid hereunder
equals the amount of interest that would have been paid had the Maximum Rate not
applied.

2.2. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Interest, Letter of Credit and LC and
Acceptance Guaranty fees and Unused Line Fees hereunder shall be calculated
daily and shall be computed on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of
360 days.

2.3. FEE LETTERS.

Fee") equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect multiplied by the average
daily amount by which the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount exceeds the sum of (i)
the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans plus (ii) the LC
and Acceptance Amount; provided, that for purposes of allocating the Unused Line
Fee, outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not be included as part of the
outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Loans for purposes of calculating
such fees owed to Revolving Credit Lenders other than Administrative Agent. The
Unused Line Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first Business Day of
each month hereafter.

2.6. PREPAYMENT FEES.

         2.6.1. If the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated in whole or

amounts owing under the terms of this Agreement and any of the other Loan
Documents, as liquidated damages for the loss of the bargain and not as a
penalty, an amount equal to one percent (1.0%) of, in the event of a termination

prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, other than a prepayment
applied to the Term Loan B in accordance with paragraph (a) or (d) of subsection
3.4.2, Borrowers shall pay to Term Loan B Agent, for the ratable benefit of Term
Loan B Lenders, as liquidated damages for the loss of the bargain and not as a
penalty, an amount equal to (i) three percent (3.0%) of the amount of the Term
Loan B so prepaid if prepayment occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of
the Closing Date; (ii) two percent (2.0%) of the amount of Term Loan B so
prepaid if prepayment occurs after the first anniversary of the Closing Date but
on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date; and (iii) one percent
(1.0%) of the amount of Term Loan B so prepaid if prepayment occurs after the
second anniversary of the Closing Date but on or prior to the third anniversary
of the Closing Date.

2.7. AUDIT FEES. Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent audit fees in
accordance with Administrative Agent's current schedule of fees in effect from
time to time in connection with audits of the books and records and Properties
of Borrowers, the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and such other
matters as Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate in its reasonable
judgment, PROVIDED, that, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, all audits shall be conducted at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, plus all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent in connection with such audits, whether such audits are
conducted by employees of Administrative Agent or by third parties hired by
Administrative Agent. Such audit fees and out-of-pocket expenses shall be
payable immediately upon demand therefor by Administrative Agent from time to
time; PROVIDED, that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower shall not be required to pay audit fees and expenses for
more than 2 audits in any fiscal year. Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion, provide for the payment of such amounts by making appropriate
Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers and charging Borrowers' Revolving Credit
Loan Account therefor.

2.8. REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES. If, at any time or times regardless of whether
or not an Event of Default then exists, (i) Administrative Agent or Term Loan B
Agent incurs legal or accounting expenses or any other costs or out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with (1) the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any amendment of or modification
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any syndication or
attempted syndication of the Obligations (including, without limitation,
printing and distribution of materials to prospective Lenders and all costs
associated with bank meetings, but excluding any closing fees paid to Lenders in
connection therewith) or (2) the administration of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; or
(ii) Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender incurs legal or
accounting expenses or any other costs or out-of-pocket expenses in connection
with (1) any litigation, contest, dispute, suit, proceeding or action (whether
instituted by Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent, any Lender, any Borrower
or any other Person) relating to the Collateral, this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or any Borrower's, any Loan Party's or any of their



                                       11
<PAGE>

respective Subsidiaries' affairs; (2) any attempt to enforce any rights of
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender against any Borrower, any
Loan Party or any other Person which may be obligated to Administrative Agent,
Term Loan B Agent or any Lender by virtue of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the Account Debtors; or (3) any
attempt to inspect, verify, protect, preserve, restore, collect, sell, liquidate
or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the Collateral; PROVIDED, that, the
expenses of any Lender under this clause (3) shall be covered hereby only if
incurred during the continuance of an Event of Default, then all such legal and
accounting expenses, other costs and out of pocket expenses of Administrative
Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender, as applicable, shall be charged to
Borrowers. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this Section 2.8 shall be
Obligations secured by all of the Collateral, shall be payable on demand to
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and,
unless earlier charged as a Revolving Credit Loan, shall bear interest from the
date 7 Business Days after such demand is made until paid in full at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans or, in the case of amounts relating to the Term
Loan B, the rate applicable to the Term Loan B, from time to time. Borrowers
shall also reimburse Administrative Agent for expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent in its administration of the Collateral to the extent and
in the manner provided in Sections 2.9 and 2.10 hereof. Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in this Agreement, the obligation of each Borrower under this
Section 2.8 shall survive the payment in full of all Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

2.9. BANK CHARGES. Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent, on demand, any
and all fees, costs or expenses which Administrative Agent or any Lender pays to
a bank or other similar institution arising out of or in connection with (i) the
forwarding to Borrowers or any other Person on behalf of Borrowers, by
Administrative Agent or any Lender, of proceeds of Loans made to Borrowers
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the depositing for collection by
Administrative Agent or any Lender of any check or item of payment received or
delivered to Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Obligations.

2.10. COLLATERAL PROTECTION EXPENSES; APPRAISALS. All out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in protecting, storing, warehousing, insuring, handling, maintaining
and shipping the Collateral, and any and all excise, property, sales, and use
taxes imposed by any state, federal, or local authority on any of the Collateral
or in respect of the sale thereof shall be borne and paid by Borrowers. If
Borrowers fail to promptly pay any portion thereof when due, Administrative
Agent may, at its option, but shall not be required to, pay the same and charge
Borrowers therefor. Additionally, from time to time, Administrative Agent and
Term Loan B Agent may, at Borrowers' expense, obtain appraisals from appraisers
(who may be personnel of Administrative Agent or Term Loan B Agent, as the case
may be), stating the then current fair market value and/or Net Orderly
Liquidation Value of all or any portion of the personal property of Borrowers or
any of their Subsidiaries, including without limitation the Inventory or
trademarks of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, that, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrowers shall not be
required to pay for more than one appraisal conducted by or on behalf of
Administrative Agent and one appraisal conducted by or on behalf of Term Loan B
Agent in any fiscal year. So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, all appraisals shall be conducted at reasonable times and
upon reasonable notice.

2.11. PAYMENT OF CHARGES. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this
Agreement shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral, shall be,

                                       12
<PAGE>

interest from the date demand was made or such amount is due, as applicable,
until paid in full at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans or, in the case of
amounts relating to the Term Loan B, the rate applicable to the Term Loan B,
from time to time.

2.12. TAXES.

         2.12.1. Subject to subsection 2.12.5, all payments made by any Borrower
to any Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any
present or future taxes, levies, assessments, imposts, duties, fees, deductions
or withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority, excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent, Term
Loan B Agent and each Lender, net income taxes imposed on the Administrative
Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender (including, without limitation, (i) any
Lender in its capacity as the Issuing Bank and (ii) any transferee or assignee
(including a participation holder) (any such entity, a "Transferee"), as the
case may be, as a result of a present or former connection between the
jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax and the
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender (excluding a connection
arising solely from the Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender
or Transferee having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or
received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document) (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings being hereinafter called "Non-Excluded Taxes").

         2.12.2. Subject to subsection 2.12.5, if any Borrower shall be required
by law to deduct or withhold any Non-Excluded Taxes or Further Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, the Term Loan B Agent or the
Administrative Agent, then:

                  (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that,
         after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
         deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under
         this Section), such Lender, the Term Loan B Agent or the Administrative
         Agent, as the case may be, receives and retains an amount equal to the
         sum it would have received and retained had no such deductions or
         withholdings been made;

                  (b) such Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;

                  (c) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or
         withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
         accordance with applicable law; and

                  (d) such Borrower shall also pay to each Lender or the
         Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, at the time
         interest is paid, Further Taxes in the amount that the respective
         Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such
         Lender would have received if such Non-Excluded Taxes or Further Taxes
         had not been imposed.

         2.12.3. Subject to subsection 2.12.5, each Borrower agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Lender, the Term Loan B Agent and the Administrative
Agent for the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes and Further Taxes in the amount
that the respective Lender, the Term Loan B Agent or the Administrative Agent
specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender, the Term




                                       13
<PAGE>

Loan B Agent or the Administrative Agent would have received if such
Non-Excluded Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability
(including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes or Further Taxes
were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be
made within 30 days after the date the applicable Lender, the Term Loan B Agent
or the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.

         2.12.4. Within 30 days after the date of any payment by any Borrower of
Non-Excluded Taxes or Further Taxes, such Borrower shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

         2.12.5. (a) Each Lender or Transferee that is a "foreign corporation,
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code, agrees that it will
deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent on or before
the date it becomes a Lender or Transferee (x) two duly completed and signed
copies of Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY or successor applicable form
(relating to such Person and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers
pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents) certifying that such
Person is entitled to receive all payments under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes (or, in the case of a Transferee, that any such deduction or
withholding is no greater than it would have been for the Lender (or the
Transferee) that transferred or assigned its interest to such Transferee). A
Form W-8BEN completed and delivered by (1) certain foreign trusts, or (2)
persons claiming an exemption or reduced rate of withholding at source under an
income tax treaty will not be considered duly completed unless the Form W-8BEN
contains such person's U.S. taxpayer identification number. Each such Lender or
Transferee also agrees (x) to deliver to the Borrower Representative and the
Administrative Agent two further completed and signed copies of one of such
forms (or successor applicable forms) on or before the date that any such
statement or form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event (including, without limitation, a change in such Lender's or Transferee's
lending office) requiring a change in the most recent statement or form
previously delivered by it to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative
Agent, and (y) to obtain such extensions of the time for filing and to renew
such statements or forms and certifications thereof as may reasonably be
requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such statements or forms inapplicable or
which would prevent such Lender or Transferee from duly completing and
delivering any such statement or form with respect to it and such Lender or
Transferee so advises the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent.
If such Person fails to deliver the above forms or other documentation, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Person an
amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code, without reduction, provided that the Borrowers shall not be
required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender pursuant to
subsection 2.12.1, unless the obligation to pay such increased amounts would not
have arisen but for a change in law. Each Lender or Transferee that is a "United
States person", as defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, and that is



                                       14
<PAGE>

not a corporation agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower Representative and
the Administrative Agent a Form W-9 stating that it is entitled to an exemption
from United States backup withholding tax.

                  (b) No Borrower shall be required to pay any additional
         amounts to any Lender or Transferee pursuant to subsection 2.12.1 if
         the obligation to pay such additional amounts arose solely from a
         failure by such Lender or Transferee to comply with the provisions of
         subsection 2.12.5(a).

         2.12.6. If any Lender or Transferee claims exemption from, or reduction
of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form
W-8BEN or W-8IMY (or any successor form) or claims an exemption from withholding
tax by providing an IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form) and such Lender or
Transferee sells, assigns or (other than pursuant to subsection 2.12.8)
otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of a Borrower to a transferee
Lender or Transferee, such Lender or Transferee agrees to notify the
Administrative Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner of Obligations of a Borrower to such Lender or Transferee. To
the extent of such percentage amount, the Administrative Agent will treat such
Lender or Transferee's IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY (or any successor form) as no
longer valid.

         2.12.7. If any Lender or Transferee claims an exemption from, or
reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY (or any successor form) or claims an exemption from
withholding tax by providing Form W-8ECI (or successor form) and such Lender or
Transferee grants a participation in the Obligations of a Borrower to a
transferee Lender or Transferee, such Lender or Transferee agrees to notify the
Administrative Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner of Obligations of a Borrower, and such Lender or Transferee
agrees to undertake responsibility to provide to the Administrative Agent such
forms and documentation (including IRS Form W-8IMY and forms and documentation
provided by each participant to the extent required by the IRS) to enable the
Borrowers to comply with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections
1441 and 1442 of the Code.

         2.12.8. If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold tax or any other amount from amounts paid to or for the
account of any Lender or Transferee (because the appropriate form was not
delivered or was not properly executed, or because such Lender or Transferee
failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which
rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or
for any other reason) such Lender or Transferee shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and
including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent under this Section 2.12, together with all costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel). The
obligation of the Lenders or Transferees under this subsection 2.12.8 shall
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent.




                                       15
<PAGE>

         2.12.9. The agreements in this Section 2.12 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans, Letters of Credit
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

                         SECTION 3. LOAN ADMINISTRATION

3.1. MANNER OF BORROWING REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS/LIBOR OPTION. Borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Facility established pursuant to Section 1 hereof shall be
as follows:

         3.1.1. BORROWING REQUEST. A request for a Revolving Credit Loan shall
be made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following manner: (a) Borrower
Representative may give Administrative Agent notice of its intention to borrow,
in which notice Borrower Representative shall specify the amount of the proposed
borrowing of a Revolving Credit Loan and the proposed borrowing date, which
shall be a Business Day, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on
the proposed borrowing date (or in accordance with subsection 3.1.7, 3.1.8 or
3.1.9, as applicable, in the case of a request for a LIBOR Loan), provided,
however, that no such request may be made at a time when there exists a Default
or an Event of Default; and (b) the becoming due of any amount required to be
paid with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility under this Agreement shall be
deemed irrevocably to be a request for a Revolving Credit Loan on the due date
in the amount required to pay such amount.

         3.1.2. DISBURSEMENT. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize
Administrative Agent to disburse the proceeds of each Loan requested, or deemed
to be requested, pursuant to subsection 3.1.1 as follows: (i) the proceeds of
each Revolving Credit Loan requested under subsection 3.1.1(a) shall be
disbursed by Administrative Agent in lawful money of the United States of
America in immediately available funds, in the case of the initial borrowing, in
accordance with the terms of the written disbursement letter from Borrower
Representative, and in the case of each subsequent borrowing, by wire transfer
to such bank account as may be agreed upon by Borrower Representative and
Administrative Agent from time to time or elsewhere if pursuant to a written
direction from Borrower Representative; and (ii) the proceeds of each Revolving
Credit Loan deemed requested under subsection 3.1.1(b) shall be disbursed by
Administrative Agent by way of direct payment of the relevant amount being paid.
If at any time any Loan is funded by Administrative Agent or Lenders in excess
of the amount requested or deemed requested by Borrower Representative,
Borrowers agree to repay the excess to Administrative Agent for the ratable
benefit of the applicable Lenders immediately upon the earlier to occur of (a)
Borrowers' discovery of the error and (b) notice thereof to Borrower
Representative from Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender.

         3.1.3. PAYMENT BY REVOLVING CREDIT LENDERS. Administrative Agent shall
give to each Revolving Credit Lender prompt written notice of the receipt by
Administrative Agent from Borrower Representative of any request for a Revolving
Credit Loan. Each such notice shall specify the requested date and amount of
such Revolving Credit Loan, whether such Revolving Credit Loan shall be subject
to the LIBOR Option, and the amount of each Revolving Credit Lender's advance
thereunder (in accordance with its applicable Percentage). Each Revolving Credit
Lender shall, not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on such requested date,
wire to a bank designated by Administrative Agent the amount of that Revolving
Credit Lender's Percentage of the requested Revolving Credit Loan. The failure
of any Revolving Credit Lender to make the Revolving Credit Loans to be made by
it shall not release any other Revolving Credit Lender of its obligations
hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Loan. Neither Administrative Agent nor



                                       16
<PAGE>

any other Revolving Credit Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Revolving Credit Lender to make the Revolving Credit Loan to be made by
such other Revolving Credit Lender. The foregoing notwithstanding,
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may from its own funds make a
Revolving Credit Loan on behalf of any Revolving Credit Lender. In such event,
the Revolving Credit Lender on behalf of whom Administrative Agent made the
Revolving Credit Loan shall reimburse Administrative Agent for the amount of
such Revolving Credit Loan made on its behalf, on a weekly (or more frequent, as
determined by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) basis. On each such
settlement date, Administrative Agent will pay to each Revolving Credit Lender
the net amount owing to such Revolving Credit Lender in connection with such
settlement, including without limitation amounts relating to Loans, fees,
interest and other amounts payable hereunder. The entire amount of interest
attributable to such Revolving Credit Loan for the period from the date on which
such Revolving Credit Loan was made by Administrative Agent on such Revolving
Credit Lender's behalf until Administrative Agent is reimbursed by such
Revolving Credit Lender, shall be paid to Administrative Agent for its own
account.

         3.1.4. AUTHORIZATION. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize
Administrative Agent, in Administrative Agent's sole discretion, to advance to
Borrowers, and to charge to Borrowers' Revolving Credit Loan Account hereunder
as a Revolving Credit Loan (which shall be a Base Rate Loan), a sum sufficient
to pay all interest accrued on the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing Line
Loans during the immediately preceding month and to pay all fees, costs and
expenses and other Obligations at any time owed by Borrowers to Administrative
Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender hereunder.

         3.1.5. LETTER OF CREDIT AND LC AND ACCEPTANCE GUARANTY REQUESTS.

                  (a) A request for a Letter of Credit or LC and Acceptance
         Guaranty shall be made in the following manner: Borrower Representative
         may give Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank a written notice of its
         request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or LC and Acceptance
         Guaranty, not later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time), three
         Business Days before the proposed issuance date thereof, in which
         notice Borrower Representative shall specify the issuance date and
         format and wording for the Letter of Credit or LC and Acceptance
         Guaranty being requested (which shall be satisfactory to Administrative
         Agent and Issuing Bank); provided, that no such request may be made at
         a time when there exists a Default or Event of Default. Such request
         shall be accompanied by an executed application and reimbursement
         agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent
         and Issuing Bank, as well as any required resolutions.

                  (b) Each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in U.S. Dollars
         and shall be either (i) a standby Letter of Credit issued to support
         obligations, contingent or otherwise, of a Borrower, to provide credit
         support for workers' compensation, other insurance programs and other
         lawful corporate purposes (a "Standby Letter of Credit") or (ii) a
         commercial letter of credit issued in respect of the purchase of goods



                                       17
<PAGE>

         and services in the ordinary course of business of a Borrower (a
         "Commercial Letter of Credit"; together with the Standby Letters of
         Credit, the "Letters of Credit"); and

                  (c) Each Letter of Credit shall expire no later than (x) 365
         days after its date of issuance in the case of any Standby Letter of
         Credit and (y) 180 days after its date of issuance in the case of any
         Commercial Letter of Credit, and in any event no Letter of Credit shall
         expire later than 5 Business Days prior to the end of the Term;
         PROVIDED, that unless Administrative Agent on behalf of Issuing Bank
         notifies Borrower Representative not less than 30 days prior to the
         expiry of any Standby Letter of Credit, which is by its terms,
         automatically extendable, that Issuing Bank is not willing to extend
         it, any such Letter of Credit may by its terms be automatically
         extended for periods of one year from the current or any future
         expiration date thereof (but not to any date which is later than 5
         Business Days prior to the end of the Term). Each Standby Letter of
         Credit shall call for sight drafts and each Commercial Letter of Credit
         shall call for sight drafts or for 30, 60 or 90 day time drafts.

                  (d) As to any Letter of Credit that is a Commercial Letter of
         Credit or Standby Letter of Credit, the most recent Uniform Customs and
         Practice for Documentary Credits adopted by a Congress of the
         International Chamber of Commerce and any subsequent revisions thereof
         approved by a Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce and
         adhered to by the Issuing Bank (the "UCP"), shall be binding on
         Borrowers and Issuing Bank except to the extent otherwise provided
         herein, in any Letter of Credit or in any other Loan Document.

                  (e) Issuing Bank shall not at any time be obligated to issue a
         Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or
         cause Issuing Bank or any Revolving Credit Lender to exceed any limits
         imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.

         3.1.6. METHOD OF MAKING REQUESTS. As an accommodation to Borrower
Representative, unless a Default or an Event of Default is then in existence,
(i) Administrative Agent shall permit telephonic or electronic requests for
Revolving Credit Loans to Administrative Agent, (ii) Administrative Agent and
Issuing Bank may, in their discretion, permit electronic transmittal of requests
for Letters of Credit and LC and Acceptance Guaranties to them, and (iii)
Administrative Agent may, in Administrative Agent's discretion, permit
electronic transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements or reports to
Administrative Agent. Unless Borrower Representative specifically directs
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank in writing not to accept or act upon
telephonic or electronic communications from Borrower Representative, neither
Administrative Agent nor Issuing Bank shall have any liability to any Borrower
or any other Loan Party for any loss or damage suffered by any Borrower or any
other Loan Party as a result of Administrative Agent's or Issuing Bank's
honoring of any requests, execution of any instructions, authorizations or
agreements or reliance on any reports communicated to it telephonically or
electronically and purporting to have been sent to Administrative Agent or
Issuing Bank by Borrower Representative, and neither Administrative Agent nor
Issuing Bank shall have any duty to verify the origin of any such communication
or the authority of the Person sending it. Each telephonic request for a




                                       18
<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Loan, Letter of Credit or LC and Acceptance Guaranty accepted
by Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, if applicable, hereunder shall be
promptly followed by a written confirmation of such request from Borrower
Representative to Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, if applicable.

         3.1.7. LIBOR LOANS. Provided that as of both the date of the LIBOR
Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or Event of Default
exists or, if a Default or Event of Default exists, neither Administrative Agent
nor Majority Revolving Credit Lenders have elected to suspend the LIBOR Option
during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, in the event
Borrower Representative desires to obtain a LIBOR Loan, Borrower Representative
shall give Administrative Agent a LIBOR Request no later than 11:00 a.m.
(Chicago, Illinois time) on the third Business Day prior to the requested
borrowing date. Each LIBOR Request shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrower
Representative. In no event shall Borrowers be permitted to have outstanding at
any one time LIBOR Loans with more than seven (7) different Interest Periods.

         3.1.8. CONVERSION OF BASE RATE LOANS. Provided that as of both the date
of the LIBOR Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or
Event of Default exists or, if a Default or Event of Default exists, neither
Administrative Agent nor Majority Revolving Credit Lenders have elected to
suspend the LIBOR Option during the continuance of such Default or Event of
Default, Borrower Representative may, on any Business Day, convert any Base Rate
Loan into a LIBOR Loan. If Borrower Representative desires to convert a Base
Rate Loan, Borrower Representative shall give Administrative Agent a LIBOR
Request no later then 11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on the third Business
Day prior to the requested conversion date. After giving effect to any
conversion of Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans, Borrowers shall not be permitted
to have outstanding at any one time LIBOR Loans with more than seven (7)
different Interest Periods.

         3.1.9. CONTINUATION OF LIBOR LOANS. Provided that as of both the date
of the LIBOR Request and the first day of the Interest Period, no Default or
Event of Default exists or, if a Default or Event of Default exists, neither
Administrative Agent nor Majority Revolving Credit Lenders have elected to
suspend the LIBOR Option during the continuance of such Default or Event of
Default, Borrower Representative may, on any Business Day, continue any LIBOR
Loans into a subsequent Interest Period of the same or a different permitted
duration. If Borrower Representative desires to continue a LIBOR Loan, Borrower
Representative shall give Administrative Agent a LIBOR Request no later than
11:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on the third Business Day prior to the
requested continuation date. After giving effect to any continuation of LIBOR
Loans, Borrowers shall not be permitted to have outstanding at any one time
LIBOR Loans with more than seven (7) different Interest Periods. If Borrower
Representative shall fail to give timely notice of its election to continue any
LIBOR Loan or portion thereof as provided above, or if such continuation shall
not be permitted, such LIBOR Loan or portion thereof, unless such LIBOR Loan
shall be repaid, shall automatically be converted into a Base Rate Loan at the
end of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to such LIBOR Loan.

         3.1.10. INABILITY TO MAKE LIBOR LOANS. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any
change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it
unlawful for any Revolving Credit Lender (for purposes of this subsection



                                       19
<PAGE>


3.1.10, the term "Revolving Credit Lender" shall include the office or branch
where such Revolving Credit Lender or any corporation or bank then controlling
such Revolving Credit Lender makes or maintains any LIBOR Loans) to make or
maintain its LIBOR Loans, or if with respect to any Interest Period,
Administrative Agent is unable to determine the LIBOR relating thereto, or
adverse or unusual conditions in, or changes in applicable law relating to, the
London interbank market make it, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative
Agent, impracticable to fund therein any of the LIBOR Loans, or make the
projected LIBOR unreflective of the actual costs of funds therefor to any
Revolving Credit Lender, the obligation of Administrative Agent and Revolving
Credit Lenders to make or continue LIBOR Loans or convert Base Rate Loans to
LIBOR Loans hereunder shall forthwith be suspended during the pendency of such
circumstances and Borrowers shall, if any affected LIBOR Loans are then
outstanding, promptly upon request from Administrative Agent, convert such
affected LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans.

         3.1.11. BORROWER REPRESENTATIVE. Each Borrower hereby designates Parent
as its representative and agent on its behalf for the purposes of requests for
Loans, giving instructions with respect to the disbursement of the proceeds of
the Loans, selecting interest rate options, requesting Letters of Credit, giving
and receiving all other notices and consents hereunder or under any of the other
Loan Documents and taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance
with covenants) on behalf of any Borrower or Borrowers under the Loan Documents.
Parent hereby accepts such appointment as Borrower Representative.
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and each Lender may regard any notice or
other communication pursuant to any Loan Document from Borrower Representative
as a notice or communication from all Borrowers, any group of Borrowers or any
Borrower, as the case may be, and may give any notice or communication required
or permitted to be given to any Borrower or Borrowers hereunder to Borrower
Representative on behalf of such Borrower or Borrowers. Each Borrower agrees
that each notice, election, representation and warranty, covenant, agreement and
undertaking made on its behalf by Borrower Representative shall be deemed for
all purposes to have been made by such Borrower and shall be binding upon and
enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as if the same had been
made directly by such Borrower.

3.2. PAYMENTS. The Obligations shall be payable as follows:

         3.2.1. PRINCIPAL.

                  (a) REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS AND SWING LINE LOANS. Principal on
         account of Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans shall be payable
         by Borrowers to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of
         Revolving Credit Lenders immediately upon the earliest of (i) the
         receipt by Administrative Agent or Borrowers of any proceeds of any of
         the Collateral (except as otherwise provided herein, including, without
         limitation, payments and prepayments under the terms of this Agreement
         to the Term Loan B, or, in the case of proceeds of Senior Noteholder
         Priority Collateral, as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement),
         including without limitation pursuant to subsections 3.3.1 and 6.2.4,
         to the extent of said proceeds, subject to Borrowers' rights to
         reborrow such amounts in compliance with subsections 1.1.1 and 1.1.2
         hereof; (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of
         which Administrative Agent or Majority Revolving Credit Lenders elect
         to accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations, or (iii)
         termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof; PROVIDED,


                                       20
<PAGE>


         HOWEVER, that, if an Overadvance shall exist at any time, Borrowers
         shall, on demand, repay the Overadvance. Each payment (including
         principal prepayment) by Borrowers on account of principal of the Swing
         Line Loans and Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied first to Swing
         Line Loans, second to Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans
         and then to Revolving Credit Loans that are LIBOR Loans.

                  (b) TERM LOAN. Beginning on the later of (i) September 1, 2005
         and (ii) the first day of the first month after the Trademark Advance
         Limit has been reduced to $0, on the first day of each month, subject
         to compliance with the provisions of clauses (x) and (y) of the
         definition of "Blocking Provisions", Borrowers shall pay to Term Loan B
         Agent, for the ratable benefit of Term Loan B Lenders, the amount of
         $833,333 in respect of the outstanding principal amount of the Term
         Loan B. If a principal payment otherwise due and payable on the Term
         Loan B pursuant to this subsection 3.2.1(b) cannot be made due to the
         failure to meet any of the Blocking Provisions set forth in clause (x)
         or (y) of the definition of "Blocking Provisions", (A) no Event of
         Default shall result therefrom and (B) Administrative Agent shall
         establish and maintain a corresponding reserve against the Borrowing
         Base in the amount of such payment until such time as the Blocking
         Provisions are satisfied, at which time Borrowers shall make such
         payment and the reserve shall be released. Until the applicable
         principal payment is made, the reserve described in the immediately
         preceding sentence may not be released without the consent of Majority
         Term Loan B Lenders. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.4 hereof,
         the entire then remaining outstanding principal balance of the Term
         Loan B shall be payable on the earlier of (i) five years after the
         Closing Date, (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection 10.2.3, the
         acceleration of the Term Loan B after an Event of Default and (iii)
         unless Borrowers shall have entered into a replacement or extension
         revolving credit facility acceptable to Majority Term Loan B Lenders,
         the termination of the Revolving Credit Facility.

         3.2.2. INTEREST. Interest accrued on all Loans shall be due and payable
on each Interest Payment Date and on the earlier of (i) the occurrence of an
Event of Default in consequence of which Administrative Agent or Majority
Revolving Credit Lenders or, subject to prior compliance with subsection 10.2.3,
Majority Term Loan B Lenders elect to accelerate the maturity and payment of the
Obligations or (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof.
Interest payable on the Revolving Credit Loans shall be payable by Borrowers to
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Revolving Credit Lenders.
Interest payable on the Term Loan B shall be payable by Borrowers to
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Term Loan B Lenders.

         3.2.3. COSTS, FEES AND CHARGES. Costs, fees and charges payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable by Borrowers as and when provided in
Section 2 or Section 3 hereof.

         3.2.4. OTHER OBLIGATIONS. The balance of the Obligations requiring the
payment of money, if any, shall be payable by Borrowers as and when provided in
this Agreement, the Other Agreements or the Security Documents, or on demand,
whichever is later.




                                       21
<PAGE>

         3.2.5. PREPAYMENT OF/FAILURE TO BORROW LIBOR LOANS. Borrowers may
prepay a LIBOR Loan only upon at least three (3) Business Days prior written
notice by Borrower Representative to Administrative Agent (which notice shall be
irrevocable). Borrowers shall pay to each Revolving Credit Lender, upon request
of such Revolving Credit Lender, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient
(in the reasonable opinion of such Revolving Credit Lender) to compensate such
Revolving Credit Lender for any loss, cost, or expense incurred as a result of:
(i) any payment of a LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan; (ii) any failure by Borrowers to borrow a
LIBOR Loan on the date specified by Borrower Representative's LIBOR Request; or
(iii) any failure by Borrowers to pay a LIBOR Loan on the date for payment
specified in Borrower Representative's written notice. Without limiting the
foregoing, Borrowers shall pay to each Revolving Credit Lender a "yield
maintenance fee" in an amount computed as follows: the current rate for United
States Treasury securities (bills on a discounted basis shall be converted to a
bond equivalent) with a maturity date closest to the Interest Period chosen
pursuant to the LIBOR Loan as to which the prepayment is made, shall be
subtracted from the LIBOR in effect at the time of prepayment. If the result is
zero or a negative number, there shall be no yield maintenance fee. If the
result is a positive number, then the resulting percentage shall be multiplied
by the amount of the principal balance being prepaid. The resulting amount shall
be divided by 360 and multiplied by the number of days remaining in the Interest
Period chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Loan as to which the prepayment is made.
Such amount shall be reduced to present value calculated by using the above
referenced United States Treasury securities rate and the number of days
remaining in the term chosen pursuant to the LIBOR Loan as to which prepayment
is made. The resulting amount shall be the yield maintenance fee due to the
applicable Revolving Credit Lender upon the prepayment of a LIBOR Loan. If by
reason of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent or Majority Revolving Credit
Lenders elect to declare the Obligations to be immediately due and payable, then
any yield maintenance fee that would be payable with respect to a LIBOR Loan
shall become due and payable in the same manner as though Borrowers had
exercised such right of prepayment on the date that the Obligations are declared
immediately due and payable.

3.3. MANDATORY AND OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.

         3.3.1. PROCEEDS OF SALE, LOSS, DESTRUCTION OR CONDEMNATION OF
COLLATERAL. Upon receipt of any Net Asset Sale Proceeds or Net Condemnation
Proceeds by any Borrower or any other Loan Party, Borrowers shall prepay the
Loans as herein provided in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
such Net Asset Sale Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds. Each such prepayment
shall be applied to the Loans in the manner specified in subsection 3.4.2 until
payment thereof in full.

         3.3.2. CONSOLIDATED EXCESS CASH FLOW RECAPTURE. Borrowers shall,
subject to the provisions of subsection 3.4.2., prepay the Term Loan B as herein
provided in an amount equal to 25% of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, with
respect to each fiscal year of Parent during the Term hereof, commencing with
the fiscal year ending on or about September 30, 2004, such prepayments to be
based upon, and be made within 5 Business Days following the due date for
delivery by Borrowers to Administrative Agent of, the annual financial
statements required by subsection 8.1.3(a) hereof. Each such prepayment shall be
applied to the Term Loan B in the manner specified in subsection 3.4.2 until
payment thereof in full.




                                       22
<PAGE>

         3.3.3. PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR EQUITY.
Upon receipt of any Net Debt Proceeds or Net Equity Proceeds by any Borrower or
any other Loan Party, Borrowers shall prepay the Loans as herein provided in an
amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Debt Proceeds or Net
Equity Proceeds. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans in the
manner specified in subsection 3.4.2 until payment thereof in full.

         3.3.4. RATIO OF OBLIGATIONS TO CONSOLIDATED EBITDA. If, on any day, the
ratio of (a) the sum of the then outstanding Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans,
LC and Acceptance Amount and Term Loan B to (b) Consolidated EBITDA for the most
recently ended twelve month period for which Borrowers have delivered financial
statements pursuant to clause (b) of subsection 8.13, exceeds 2.0 to 1.0,
Borrowers shall prepay the Loans as herein provided in an amount equal to the
amount required to cause such ratio to be not greater than 2.0 to 1.0; PROVIDED,
that, Borrowers shall be entitled to one three (3) Business Day grace period
with respect to such mandatory prepayment in any period of twelve consecutive
months. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans in the manner
specified in subsection 3.4.2 until payment thereof in full.

         3.3.5. LIBOR LOANS. If the application of any payment made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3 at a time when no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing would result in termination of a LIBOR
Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan, the
amount of such prepayment shall not be applied to such LIBOR Loan, but will, at
Borrower Representative's option, be held by Administrative Agent in a
non-interest bearing account at a Revolving Credit Lender or another bank
satisfactory to Administrative Agent in its discretion, which account is in the
name of Administrative Agent and from which account only Administrative Agent
can make any withdrawal, in each case to be applied as such amount would
otherwise have been applied under this Section 3.3 at the earlier to occur of
(i) the last day of the relevant Interest Period or (ii) the occurrence of a
Default or an Event of Default.

         3.3.6. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS OF TERM LOAN B. Borrowers may, at their
option from time to time upon not less than 5 Business Days prior written notice
to Administrative Agent and Term Loan B Agent, prepay installments of the Term
Loan B, provided that (i) at the time of such payment, each of the Blocking
Provisions shall then be satisfied, (ii) the amount of any such prepayment is at
least $500,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, (iii) such
prepayments are made ratably with respect to all Term Loan B Lenders and (iv)
concurrently with such prepayment, Borrowers shall, if applicable, pay the
prepayment fee described in subsection 2.6.2. Each such prepayment shall be
applied to the installments of principal due under the Term Loan B on a pro rata
basis to each installment.

         3.3.7. OPTIONAL REDUCTIONS OF REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS. Borrowers
may, at their option from time to time upon not less than 3 Business Days' prior
written notice to Administrative Agent, permanently reduce ratably in part, the
unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments, provided, however, that (i)
each such partial reduction shall be in an amount of $500,000 or integral
multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the aggregate of all optional
reductions to the Revolving Credit Commitments may not exceed $100,000,000
during the Term, except that the Revolving Credit Commitments may be terminated
in whole. Except for the prepayment fee payable under subsection 2.6.1, such
reductions of the Revolving Credit Commitment shall be without premium or
penalty.

         3.4.1. COLLECTIONS. All items of payment received by Administrative
Agent or Term Loan B Agent by 12:00 noon, Chicago, Illinois, time, on any
Business Day shall be deemed received on that Business Day. All items of payment
received after 12:00 noon, Chicago, Illinois, time, on any Business Day shall be
deemed received on the following Business Day. If as the result of collections
of Accounts, a credit balance exists in the Revolving Credit Loan Account, such

disbursed to Borrowers or otherwise at Borrower Representative's direction in
the manner set forth in subsection 3.1.2, upon Borrower Representative's request
at any time, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists.
Administrative Agent may at its sole option, offset such credit balance against
any of the Obligations upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default.

         maintain a corresponding reserve against the Borrowing Base in the

         Provisions are satisfied, at which time Borrowers shall make such
         prepayment with respect to the Term Loan B and the reserve shall be
         released. Until the applicable mandatory prepayment is made, the

to pay all Obligations constituting Product Obligations described in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of such term up to an amount not to exceed
$7,500,000 plus the amount of any such Product Obligations as to which a reserve
shall have been concurrently established and maintained against the Borrowing
Base, and Product Obligations described in clause (iv) of the definition of such
term up to an amount not to exceed the amount of any such Product Obligations as
to which a reserve shall have been concurrently established and maintained
against the Borrowing Base; SEVENTH, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense
reimbursements then due to Term Loan B Agent and Term Loan B Lenders, EIGHTH, to
pay interest due in respect of the Term Loan B, NINTH, to pay or prepay
principal of the Term Loan B; and TENTH, to the payment of any other Obligation
including, any remaining Obligations constituting or related to Product
Obligations. In setting the reserve for Product Obligations described in clause
(iv) of the definition of Product Obligations (as contemplated in the later part
of clause SIXTH above) Administrative Agent shall set such reserve based on the
reasonable estimate of such Obligations made by the Revolving Credit Lender or
Affiliate thereof to whom such Obligations are owed, employing the customary
methodology of such Revolving Credit Lender or Affiliate thereof; but
Administrative Agent may (unless otherwise directed in writing by the Majority
Revolving Credit Lenders) exclude from the calculation of such reserve the
estimated liability of a Borrower under such a clause (iv) Product Obligation
that was not approved by Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, prior to
a Borrower's becoming a party to such a clause (iv) Product Obligation.

3.5. SEPARATE OBLIGATIONS. Each of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term
Loan B shall constitute a separate general Obligation of Borrowers, and each
shall be secured by Administrative Agent's Lien upon all of the Collateral,
subject to the priorities in application of payments between the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Term Loan B set forth herein.

3.6. LOAN ACCOUNTS. Administrative Agent shall enter all Revolving Credit Loans
and the Term Loan B as debits to separate loan accounts (respectively, the
"Revolving Credit Loan Account" and the "Term Loan B Account", and each a "Loan
Account") and shall also record in the applicable Loan Account all payments made
by Borrowers on any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral which are finally
paid to Administrative Agent and may record therein, in accordance with
customary accounting practice, other debits and credits, including interest and
all charges and expenses properly chargeable to Borrowers.

3.7. STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT. Administrative Agent will account to Borrowers
monthly with a statement of Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loan B, the
respective charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement during the
immediately preceding month, and such accounts rendered by Administrative Agent
shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrowers absent demonstrable
error unless Administrative Agent is notified by Borrower Representative in
writing to the contrary within 30 days of the date each accounting is received
by Borrower Representative. Such notice shall only be deemed an objection to
those items specifically objected to therein.

3.8. INCREASED COSTS. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) adopted or implemented after the date of this Agreement and having general
applicability to all banks or finance companies within the jurisdiction in which
any Lender operates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the effect of and
phasing in of capital requirements or other regulations or guidelines passed
prior to the date of this Agreement), or any interpretation or application
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
application thereof, or the compliance of such Lender therewith, shall: (i)
subject such Lender to any tax with respect to this Agreement (other than (a)
any tax based on or measured by net income or otherwise in the nature of a net
income tax, including, without limitation, any franchise tax or any similar tax
based on capital, net worth or comparable basis for measurement and (b) any tax
collected by a withholding on payments and which neither is computed by
reference to the net income of the payee nor is in the nature of an advance
collection of a tax based on or measured by the net income of the payee); (ii)
change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender of principal, fees,
interest or any other amount payable hereunder or under any Loan Documents
(other than in respect of (a) any tax based on or measured by net income or
otherwise in the nature of a net income tax, including, without limitation, any
franchise tax or any similar tax based on capital, net worth or comparable basis
for measurement and (b) any tax collected by a withholding on payments and which
neither is computed by reference to the net income of the payee nor is in the
nature of an advance collection of a tax based on or measured by the net income
of the payee); (iii) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except any
reserve taken into account in the determination of the applicable LIBOR),
special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or




                                       27
<PAGE>

deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit
extended by, any office of such Lender, including (without limitation) pursuant
to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or (iv)
impose on such Lender or the London interbank market any other condition with
respect to any Loan Document; and the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to such Lender of making, renewing or maintaining Loans
hereunder or to reduce the rate of return on such Lender's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder, or to reduce the amount of any payment
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the Loans,
then, in any such case, Borrowers shall pay such Lender, upon demand and
certification not later than sixty (60) days following receipt by Borrower
Representative of notice of the imposition of such increased costs, such
additional amount as will compensate such Lender for such additional cost or
such reduction, as the case may be, to the extent such Lender has not otherwise
been compensated, with respect to a particular Loan, for such increased cost as
a result of an increase in the Base Rate or the LIBOR. An officer of the
applicable Lender shall determine the amount of such additional cost or reduced
amount using reasonable averaging and attribution methods and shall certify the
amount of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowers, which
certification shall include a written explanation of such additional cost or
reduction to Borrowers. Such certification shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. If a Lender claims any additional cost or reduced amount pursuant to this
Section 3.8, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with
legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office or to
file any certificate or document reasonably requested by Borrowers if the making
of such designation or filing would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
any such additional cost or reduced amount and would not, in the sole discretion
of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

3.9. BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE. In the event that
Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender shall have determined that:
(i) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR for any Interest
Period; or (ii) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant
maturity are not available in the London interbank market with respect to a
proposed LIBOR Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR
Loan; then Administrative Agent or such Revolving Credit Lender shall give
Borrower Representative prompt written, telephonic or electronic notice of the
determination of such effect. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested
LIBOR Loan shall be made as a Base Rate Loan, unless Borrower Representative
shall notify Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois
time) three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing that
the request for such borrowing shall be canceled or made as an unaffected type
of LIBOR Loan, and (ii) any Base Rate Loan which was to have been converted to
an affected type of LIBOR Loan shall be continued as or converted into a Base
Rate Loan, or, if Borrower Representative shall notify Administrative Agent, no
later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) three (3) Business Days prior to
the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of LIBOR
Loan.

3.10. SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or
otherwise) on account of any Loan made by it in excess of its ratable share of
payments on account of such Loan, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from each
other affected Lender under such Loan a participation in such Loan as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably
with each other affected Lender; provided, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such
purchase from each affected Lender shall be rescinded and such affected Lender
shall repay to the purchasing Lenders the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery, together with an amount equal to such affected Lender's ratable share



                                       28
<PAGE>

(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such affected Lender's
required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing
Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender
in respect of the total amount so recovered. Borrowers agree that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 3.10
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrowers in the amount of such
participation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
purchases and repayments to be made under this Section 3.10 shall be made
through Administrative Agent.

                        SECTION 4. TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1. TERM OF AGREEMENT. Subject to the right of Revolving Credit Lenders to
cease making Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers during the continuance of any
Default or Event of Default, this Agreement shall be in effect for a period of
five (5) years from the date hereof, through and including July 15, 2008 (the
"Term"), unless terminated as provided in Section 4.2 hereof.

4.2. TERMINATION.

         4.2.1. TERMINATION BY LENDERS. Administrative Agent may, and at the
direction of Majority Revolving Credit Lenders shall, terminate this Agreement
without notice upon or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default.

         4.2.2. TERMINATION BY BORROWERS. Upon at least 5 Business Days prior
written notice by Borrower Representative to Administrative Agent, Borrowers may
terminate this Agreement; provided, however, no such termination shall be
effective until (i) Borrowers have paid, or, in the case of Obligations other
than to Term Loan B Agent and Term Loan B Lenders, collateralized (including,
without limitation, by way of a letter of credit) to Administrative Agent's
satisfaction, all of the Obligations in immediately available funds, (ii) all
Letters of Credit and LC and Acceptance Guaranties have expired, terminated or
have been cash collateralized to Administrative Agent's satisfaction and (iii)
Borrowers have complied with Section 2.6 and subsection 3.2.5. Any notice of
termination given by Borrower Representative shall be irrevocable unless all
Lenders otherwise agree in writing and no Revolving Credit Lender shall have any
obligation to make any Revolving Credit Loans or issue or participate in any
Letters of Credit or LC and Acceptance Guaranties on or after the termination
date stated in such notice. Borrowers may elect to terminate this Agreement in
its entirety only. No section of this Agreement or type of Loan available
hereunder may be terminated singly; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT, the Revolving
Credit Facility may be terminated singly if Borrowers shall have entered into a
replacement or extension revolving credit facility acceptable to Majority Term
Loan B Lenders.

         4.2.3. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. All of the Obligations shall be
immediately due and payable upon the termination date stated in any notice of
termination of this Agreement. Until the Obligations have been paid in full or,
in the case of Obligations other than to Term Loan B Agent and Term Loan B
Lenders, cash collateralized or covered by a letter of credit to Administrative




                                       29
<PAGE>

Agent's satisfaction as provided herein, all undertakings, agreements,
covenants, warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Loan
Documents shall survive any such termination, except that any provisions of this
Agreement that expressly survive payment in full of the Obligations shall so
survive. Administrative Agent shall retain its Liens in the Collateral and each
of Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and each Lender shall retain all of
its respective rights and remedies under the Loan Documents notwithstanding such
termination until all Obligations have been discharged or paid, in full, in
immediately available funds or, in the case of Obligations other than to Term
Loan B Agent and Term Loan B Lenders, collateralized to Administrative Agent's
satisfaction as provided herein, including, without limitation, all Obligations
under Section 2.6 and subsection 3.2.5 resulting from such termination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the payment in full of the Obligations,
Administrative Agent shall not be required to terminate its Liens in the
Collateral unless, with respect to any loss or damage Administrative Agent may
incur as a result of dishonored checks or other items of payment received by
Administrative Agent from Borrowers or any Account Debtor and applied to the
Obligations, Administrative Agent shall, at its option, (i) have received a
written agreement satisfactory to Administrative Agent, executed by Borrowers
and by any Person whose loans or other advances to Borrowers are used in whole
or in part to satisfy the Obligations, indemnifying Administrative Agent and
each Revolving Credit Lender from any such loss or damage or (ii) have retained
cash Collateral or other Collateral (including, without limitation, a letter of
credit in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent) for such
period of time as Administrative Agent, in its discretion, may deem necessary to
protect Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender from any such loss
or damage.

                                       32
<PAGE>

5.4. LIEN ON REALTY. The due and punctual payment and performance of the
Obligations shall also be secured by the Lien created by Mortgages upon the
Mortgaged Properties listed on Exhibit 5.4 hereof and all other real Property of
each Borrower or Loan Party hereafter acquired having a fair market value in
excess of $500,000. Each Mortgage shall be executed by the applicable Borrower
or Loan Party in favor of Administrative Agent. Each Mortgage shall be duly
recorded, at Borrowers' expense, in each office where such recording is required
to constitute a fully perfected Lien on the real Property covered thereby.
Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent, at Borrowers' expense,
mortgagee title insurance policies issued by Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation
or another title insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
Agent, which policies shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent and shall insure a valid Lien in favor of Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of itself and the Lenders, on the Property covered by

reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and its counsel. The title
insurance amounts for each Mortgaged Property listed on Exhibit 5.4 shall be
limited to the title insurance amounts set forth on Exhibit 5.4 and the title
insurance amounts for other Mortgaged Property shall be limited to 120% of the
fair value of such Mortgaged Property. The mortgage amounts for certain of the

amounts set forth on Exhibit 5.4 and the mortgage amounts for any other
Mortgaged Property located in a jurisdiction having a mortgage recording tax or
similar tax shall be limited to 120% of the fair value of such Mortgaged

be the ALTA 1992 form, if available without extra cost in the jurisdiction in
which the applicable Mortgaged Property is located, otherwise it shall be the
form available without extra cost in jurisdiction where the applicable Mortgaged
Property is located. The endorsements for the Mortgaged Properties set forth on
Exhibit 5.4 shall be limited to the endorsements set forth on said Exhibit and
the endorsements for any other Mortgaged Property shall be limited to the

to a contiguity endorsement and a mortgage tax endorsement, if applicable in the
jurisdiction where the applicable Mortgaged Property is located. Borrowers shall
deliver to Administrative Agent such other documents, including, without
limitation, boundary surveys of the real Property, as Administrative Agent and
its counsel may request relating to the real Property subject to the Mortgages,
but excluding coinsurance, reinsurance, as-built surveys, abstracts, appraisals,
zoning, compliance and condition reports and legal opinions.

and Lenders, in Collateral comprised of certain Equipment, Fixtures and owned
real Property and cash proceeds thereof which are held in a segregated cash
collateral account as provided in the New Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall

Agreement.

5.6. RELEASE OF LIENS. Upon the occurrence of any sale or other disposition of
Collateral permitted hereunder, Administrative Agent agrees that it shall, at
the expense of Borrowers, execute and deliver a release of its Lien on such

<PAGE>

                      SECTION 6. COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION

6.1. GENERAL.

         6.1.1. LOCATION OF COLLATERAL. All Collateral, other than Collateral in
the possession of the Administrative Agent, Inventory in transit and motor
vehicles, will at all times be kept by the Loan Parties at one or more of the
business locations set forth in Exhibit 6.1.1 hereto, as updated by Borrower
Representative providing written notice to Administrative Agent of any new
location to be added to such Exhibit, such notice to be given at the same time
as Borrower Representative delivers the first Borrowing Base Certificate after
any Collateral has been first kept at such location.

         6.1.2. INSURANCE OF COLLATERAL.

                  (a) Borrowers shall maintain and pay for insurance upon all
         Collateral wherever located and with respect to the business of
         Borrowers and each of their respective Subsidiaries, covering property,
         public liability, workers' compensation and such other risks in such
         amounts and with such insurance companies as are reasonably
         satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Borrowers shall deliver certified
         copies of such policies to Administrative Agent as promptly as
         practicable, with satisfactory lender's loss payable endorsements,
         naming Administrative Agent as a loss payee, assignee or additional
         insured, as appropriate, as its interest may appear, and showing only
         such other loss payees, assignees and additional insureds as are
         satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Each policy of insurance or
         endorsement shall contain a clause requiring the insurer to give not
         less than 10 days' prior written notice to Administrative Agent in the
         event of cancellation of the policy for nonpayment of premium and not
         less than 30 days' prior written notice to Administrative Agent in the
         event of cancellation of the policy for any other reason whatsoever.
         Borrowers agree to deliver to Administrative Agent, promptly as
         rendered, true copies of all reports made in any reporting forms to
         insurance companies. All proceeds of business interruption insurance
         (if any) of Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries shall be
         remitted to Administrative Agent for application to the outstanding
         balance of the Revolving Credit Loans without a permanent reduction of
         the Revolving Credit Commitments.

                  (b) Unless Borrowers provide Administrative Agent with
         evidence of the insurance coverage required by this Agreement,
         Administrative Agent may purchase insurance at Borrowers' expense to
         protect Administrative Agent's interests in the Properties of the Loan
         Parties. This insurance may, but need not, protect the interests of the
         Loan Parties. The coverage that Administrative Agent purchases may not
         pay any claim that any Borrower or any Subsidiary makes or any claim
         that is made against such Borrower or any such Subsidiary in connection
         with said Property. Borrowers may later cancel any insurance purchased
         by Administrative Agent, but only after providing Administrative Agent
         with evidence that Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries have
         obtained insurance as required by this Agreement. If Administrative
         Agent purchases insurance, Borrowers will be responsible for the costs




                                       34
<PAGE>

         of that insurance, including interest and any other charges
         Administrative Agent may impose in connection with the placement of
         insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration
         of the insurance. The costs of the insurance may be added to the
         Obligations. The costs of the insurance may be more than the cost of
         insurance that Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries may be able
         to obtain on their own.

         6.1.3. PROTECTION OF COLLATERAL. Neither Administrative Agent nor any
Lender shall be liable or responsible in any way for the safekeeping of any of
the Collateral or for any loss or damage thereto (except for reasonable care in
the custody thereof while any Collateral is in Administrative Agent's or any
Lender's actual possession) or for any diminution in the value thereof, or for
any act or default of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, or other
person whomsoever, but the same shall be at Borrowers' sole risk.

6.2. ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTS.

         6.2.1. RECORDS, SCHEDULES AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ACCOUNTS. Borrowers shall,
and shall cause each other Loan Party to, keep accurate and complete records of
its Accounts and all payments and collections thereon. Concurrently with the
delivery of each Borrowing Base Certificate described in subsection 8.1.4, from
and after the date hereof, Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent a
summary aged trial balance of all Accounts of Borrowers and each other Loan

therefor during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, copies of
proof of delivery and the original copy of all documents, as Administrative
Agent shall reasonably request. If requested by Administrative Agent during the

interest in, or against, the funds so deposited. All amounts deposited in a
Dominion Account or Dominion Accounts shall immediately become the property of
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, and shall be applied

Collateral, shall be held as Administrative Agent's property, for its benefit
and the benefit of Lenders, by such Borrower as trustee of an express trust for
Administrative Agent's benefit and such Borrower shall immediately deposit same
in kind in the Dominion Account or a blocked account. Administrative Agent
retains the right at all times after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default to notify Account Debtors that each Borrower's Accounts
have been assigned to Administrative Agent and to collect each Borrower's
Accounts directly in its own name, or in the name of Administrative Agent's
agent, and to charge the collection costs and expenses, including attorneys'
fees, to Borrowers.

         6.2.6. TAXES. If an Account includes a charge for any tax payable to
any governmental taxing authority, Administrative Agent is authorized, in its
sole discretion, to pay the amount thereof to the proper taxing authority for
the account of Borrowers and to charge Borrowers therefor, except for taxes that
(i) are being actively contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings
and with respect to which the relevant Borrower maintains reasonable reserves on
its books therefor and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to result in any
Lien other than a Permitted Lien. In no event shall Administrative Agent or any
Lender be liable for any taxes to any governmental taxing authority that may be
due by any Borrower.

physical inventory, or cycle count programs with such frequency and in such
manner as is consistent with Borrowers' past practices and shall provide to
Administrative Agent a report based thereon promptly thereafter, together with

as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of



                                       43

1940 or (b) is a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         7.1.29. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed on Exhibit 7.1.29:

                  (a) The properties now or formerly owned or operated by each
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries (as referred to in this subsection
         7.1.29, the "Owned Properties") do not contain any Hazardous Materials
         resulting from any Release of Hazardous Materials during such
         Borrower's or its Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of the Owned
         Properties or, to the knowledge of such Borrower, at any other time, in
         amounts or concentrations which could reasonably be expected to give
         rise to liability under, Environmental Laws except to the extent that
         such liabilities, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The Owned Properties currently owned or operated by each
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries and all operations of such Borrower and
         its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and, to the extent that such
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries owned or operated such Owned
         Properties in the past three years, in the last three years have been
         in compliance, with all Environmental Laws and all Environmental
         Permits and all necessary Environmental Permits have been obtained and
         are in effect, except to the extent that such non-compliance or failure
         to obtain any necessary permits, in the aggregate, could not reasonably
         be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) During the time of such Borrower's or its Subsidiaries'
         ownership or operation of the Owned Properties and, to the knowledge of
         such Borrower, at any other time, there have been no Releases or
         threatened Releases at, from or under the Owned Properties or otherwise
         in connection with the operations of such Borrower or its Subsidiaries,
         which Releases or threatened Releases, in the aggregate, could
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and none
         of the Owned Properties currently owned or operated by such Borrower
         and its Subsidiaries are listed on the Federal National Priorities List
         (under CERCLA and as defined pursuant to Environmental Law).

                  (d) No Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
         Environmental Claim in connection with any of the Owned Properties or
         the operations of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or with
         regard to any Person whose liabilities for environmental matters such
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has retained or assumed, in whole
         or in part, contractually, by operation of law or otherwise, which
         Environmental Claim, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor do such Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries have reason to believe that notice of any such
         Environmental Claim will be received or is being threatened.

                  (e) Hazardous Materials have not been transported from any of
         the Owned Properties by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
         the knowledge of Borrowers, any other party, nor have Hazardous
         Materials been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or
         under any of the Owned Properties in a manner that could reasonably be
         expected to give rise to liability under any Environmental Law that
         would constitute a Material Adverse Effect. No Borrower nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has retained or assumed any liability, contractually, by



                                       44
<PAGE>

         operation of law or otherwise, with respect to the generation,
         treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous Materials, which
         transportation, generation, treatment, storage or disposal, or retained
         or assumed liabilities, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
         to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

and warranty contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
continuous in nature and shall remain accurate, complete and not misleading at
all times during the term of this Agreement, except for changes in the nature of

Document either inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, so long as Majority
Lenders have consented to such changes or such changes are expressly permitted
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan

Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of each Borrower, any Subsidiary of any
Borrower, or any Guarantor in this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents,
or any instrument, certificate or financial statement furnished in compliance
with or in reference thereto.

7.3. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties of each Borrower contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan

the transactions described therein or related thereto.

limiting the foregoing, each Borrower will participate and will cause its key
management personnel to participate in a meeting with Administrative Agent, Term

be held at such times and such places as may be reasonably requested by
Administrative Agent.

         8.1.2. NOTICES. Promptly notify Administrative Agent and Term Loan B

limits and Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein. In
addition, each Borrower agrees to provide Administrative Agent and Term Loan B

each Borrower and each other Loan Party shall execute and deliver to

         any Governmental Authority, against any Borrower or any Subsidiary
         thereof that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect;

                  (c) any development that has resulted in, or could reasonably
         be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (d) any change in its accounting treatment with respect to the
         valuation of Inventory.

         8.1.11. ERISA. Each Borrower will, and will cause each of the
Subsidiaries to, (a) comply with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code
and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder, except where the
failure to comply therewith could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and (b) furnish to the Administrative Agent and Term Loan B
Agent (i) as soon as possible, and in any event within 30 days after any
responsible officer of such Borrower either knows or has a reasonable basis to
know that any Reportable Event has occurred, that alone or together with any
other Reportable Event could reasonably be expected to result in liability, of
such Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to the PBGC, a statement of
a responsible officer of such Borrower (in his or her capacity as such) setting
forth details as to such Reportable Event and the action proposed to be taken

Days after the due date for filing with the PBGC pursuant to Section 412(n) of

of ERISA; PROVIDED, however, that no such notice will be required under this
subsection 8.1.11 unless the event, when aggregated with all other events
described in this subsection 8.1.11 occurring at the same time, could be
reasonably expected to result in liability to such Borrower, any Subsidiary or
any ERISA Affiliate in an amount that would exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate

following, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, each Borrower will, and will cause each of
the Subsidiaries to, comply, and use its reasonable and customary best efforts
to cause all lessees and other Persons occupying its Properties to comply, in



                                       49
<PAGE>

all material respects with all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits
applicable to its operations and Properties; obtain and renew all material
Environmental Permits necessary for its operations and Properties; and conduct
any remedial action required by any Governmental Authority in accordance with
Environmental Laws; provided, however, that no Borrower nor any of the
Subsidiaries shall be required to comply with any Environmental Laws or
undertake any remedial action to the extent that its obligation to do so is
being contested in good faith and appropriate reserves are being maintained with
respect to such circumstances.

         8.1.14. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS. Each Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Domestic Subsidiaries to (a) consistent with past

may be, all of its or their right, title and interest in each material Patent,
Trademark and Copyright used in its or their business in the United States which

Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a perfected, first
priority security interest therein and in any goodwill and general intangibles
relating thereto or represented thereby.

         8.1.15. DOMINION ACCOUNTS. On or prior to the 60th day following the
Closing Date, each Borrower that does not as of the Closing Date maintain

Administrative Agent prior to the Closing Date.

         8.1.16. FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  (a) Each Borrower shall ensure that all written information,
         exhibits and reports furnished to the Administrative Agent, Term Loan B

         to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the
         circumstances in which made, and will promptly disclose to the
         Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and the Lenders and correct any
         such defect or error that may be discovered therein or in any Loan
         Document or in the execution, acknowledgement or recordation thereof.

                  (b) Promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent, Term
         Loan B Agent or the Majority Lenders, each Borrower shall execute,

         instruments the Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such
         Lenders, as the case may be, may reasonably require from time to time
         in order (i) to carry out more effectively the purposes of this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document, and (ii) to better assure,
         convey, grant, assign, transfer, preserve, protect and confirm to the
         Administrative Agent and Lenders the rights granted or now or hereafter
         intended to be granted to Administrative Agent under any Loan Document

Borrower jointly and severally covenants that, unless otherwise consented to by
Majority Lenders, in writing, it shall not:

         into any Borrower other than Parent (if such Borrower is the surviving
         entity) or another wholly-owned Subsidiary of any Borrower and mergers
         of any Borrower (other than Parent) into any other Borrower (other than

nature, as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing, advertising for sale
and selling any Collateral and each Borrower's and each of its Subsidiary's
rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to
Administrative Agent's benefit.

         10.3.5. Administrative Agent may, at its option, require Borrowers to
deposit with Administrative Agent funds equal to the LC and Acceptance Amount
and, if Borrowers fail to promptly make such deposit, Administrative Agent may
advance such amount as a Revolving Credit Loan (whether or not an Overadvance is
created thereby). Each such Revolving Credit Loan shall be secured by all of the
Collateral and shall constitute a Base Rate Loan. Any such deposit or advance
shall be held by Administrative Agent as a reserve to fund future payments on
such LC and Acceptance Guaranties and future drawings against such Letters of
Credit. At such time as all LC and Acceptance Guaranties have been paid or
terminated and all Letters of Credit have been drawn upon or expired, any
amounts remaining in such reserve shall be applied against any outstanding
Obligations, or, if all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full,
returned to Borrowers.

10.4. SET OFF AND SHARING OF PAYMENTS. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby
authorized by Borrowers at any time or from time to time, with prior written
consent of Administrative Agent and with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to
Borrower Representative (any prior or contemporaneous notice to Borrowers being
hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all
(i) balances held by such Lender at any of its offices for the account of any
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such balances are
then due to such Borrower or its Subsidiaries), and (ii) other property at any
time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or for the account of any
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, against and on account of any of the
Obligations. Any Lender exercising a right to set off shall comply with the
provisions of Section 3.10. Each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, that any Lender may exercise its right to set off with respect
to amounts in excess the amount to which such Lender is entitled at such time
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and each such Lender, upon doing so,
shall deliver such excess to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Lenders,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Lender shall exercise any rights or remedies hereunder without the prior
written consent of Administrative Agent.

10.5. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; NO WAIVER. All covenants, conditions, provisions,
warranties, guaranties, indemnities, and other undertakings of Borrowers
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in any document
referred to herein or contained in any agreement supplementary hereto or in any
schedule or in any Guaranty Agreement given to Administrative Agent or any
Lender or contained in any other agreement between any Lender and any Borrower
or between Administrative Agent and any Borrower heretofore, concurrently, or
hereafter entered into, shall be deemed cumulative to and not in derogation or
substitution of any of the terms, covenants, conditions, or agreements of
Borrowers herein contained. The failure or delay of Administrative Agent or any
Lender to require strict performance by any Borrower or any other Loan Party of
any provision of this Agreement or to exercise or enforce any rights, Liens,
powers, or remedies hereunder or under any of the aforesaid agreements or other



                                       67
<PAGE>

documents or security or Collateral shall not operate as a waiver of such
performance, Liens, rights, powers and remedies, but all such requirements,
Liens, rights, powers, and remedies shall continue in full force and effect
until all Loans and other Obligations owing or to become owing from any Borrower
or any other Loan Party to Administrative Agent and each Lender have been fully
satisfied. None of the undertakings, agreements, warranties, covenants and
representations of any Borrower contained in this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents and no Default or Event of Default by any Borrower under this
Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been suspended or
waived by Lenders, unless such suspension or waiver is by an instrument in
writing specifying such suspension or waiver and is signed by a duly authorized
representative of Administrative Agent and directed to Borrower Representative.

                             SECTION 11. THE AGENTS

11.1. AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.

         11.1.1. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent
to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Administrative Agent
by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that Administrative Agent
shall not have by reason of this Agreement assumed a fiduciary relationship in
respect of any Lender. In performing its functions and duties under this
Agreement, Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of Lenders and shall
not assume, or be deemed to have assumed, any obligation toward, or relationship
of agency or trust with or for, Borrowers. As to any matters not expressly
provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including without
limitation enforcement and collection of the Notes), Administrative Agent may,
but shall not be required to, exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Lenders
holding the requisite amount of Obligations set forth in Section 11.10, whenever
such instruction shall be requested by Administrative Agent or required
hereunder, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders; provided,
that Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
take any action which exposes Administrative Agent to any liability or which is
contrary to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or applicable law, unless
Administrative Agent is indemnified to its satisfaction by the other Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which it may incur by reason of taking
or continuing to take any such action. If Administrative Agent seeks the consent
or approval of the Lenders with respect to any action hereunder, Administrative
Agent shall send notice thereof to each Lender and shall notify each Lender at
any time that the Lenders holding the requisite amount of Obligations set forth
in Section 11.10 have instructed Administrative Agent to act or refrain from
acting pursuant hereto.

         11.1.2. Each Term Loan B Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Term
Loan B Agent to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Term Loan B
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Each Term Loan B Lender hereby acknowledges that
Term Loan B Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement assumed a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Term Loan B Lender. In performing its functions
and duties under this Agreement, Term Loan B Agent shall act solely as agent of
Term Loan B Lenders and shall not assume, or be deemed to have assumed, any
obligation toward, or relationship of agency or trust with or for, Borrowers.




                                       68
<PAGE>

         11.1.3. In any bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving any Borrower
or any of their Subsidiaries, Administrative Agent and Term Loan B Agent shall
each have the option to act separately, with Administrative Agent acting on
behalf of itself and in its capacity as agent for the Revolving Credit Lenders,
and Term Loan B Agent acting on behalf of itself and in its capacity as agent
for the Term Loan B Lenders. Each of Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself
and the Revolving Credit Lenders, and Term Loan B Agent, on behalf of itself and
the Term Loan B Lenders, shall be able to assert separate claims and take
separate positions in any such proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, neither
Administrative Agent nor Term Loan B Agent shall assert any claim or take any
position or support any other Person asserting a claim or taking a position that
violates or conflicts with any of the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

11.2. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S AND TERM LOAN B AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. Neither
Administrative Agent, any Affiliate of Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent,
any Affiliate of Term Loan B Agent nor any of their respective directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to
be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each of
Administrative Agent and Term Loan B Agent: (i) may treat each Lender party
hereto as the holder of Obligations until Administrative Agent and Term Loan B
Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer or such lender's
portion of the Obligations signed by such Lender and in form reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent; (ii) may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts, (iii) makes
no warranties or representations to any Lender and shall not be responsible to
any Lender for any recitals, statements, warranties or representations made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Documents; (iv) shall not
have any duty beyond Administrative Agent's or Term Loan B Agent's, as the case
may be, customary practices in respect of loans in which Administrative Agent or
Term Loan B Agent, as the case may be, is the only lender, to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part of any
Borrower, to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any
Borrower, to monitor the financial condition of any Borrower or to ascertain the
existence or possible existence or continuation of any Default or Event of
Default; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto. Additionally, Administrative Agent (i)
shall not be liable to any Lender for any action taken, or inaction, by
Administrative Agent upon the instructions of Majority Revolving Credit Lenders
pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof or refraining to take any action pending such
instructions; (ii) shall not be liable for any apportionment or distributions of
payments made by it in good faith pursuant to Section 3 hereof; (iii) shall
incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, message or other
instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, facsimile, telegram, cable or
telex) believed in good faith by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
proper party or parties; and (iv) may assume that no Event of Default has




                                       69
<PAGE>

occurred and is continuing, unless Administrative Agent has actual knowledge of
the Event of Default, has received notice from Borrower Representative or
Borrower Representative's independent certified public accounts stating the
nature of the Event of Default, or has received notice from a Lender stating the
nature of the Event of Default and that such Lender considers the Event of
Default to have occurred and to be continuing. In the event any apportionment or
distribution described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Person to whom
payment was due but not made shall be to recover from the recipients of such
payments any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to
have been entitled.

11.3. FLEET AND AFFILIATES. With respect to its commitment hereunder to make
Loans, Fleet shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not Administrative Agent; and the terms "Lender," "Lenders," "Revolving
Credit Lender," and "Revolving Credit Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include Fleet in its individual capacity as a Lender and Revolving
Credit Lender. Fleet and its Affiliates may lend money to, and generally engage
in any kind of business with, any Borrower, and any Person who may do business
with or own Securities of any Borrower all as if Fleet were not Administrative
Agent and without any duty to account therefor to any other Lender.

11.4. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent
or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to herein and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement. Administrative Agent and Term Loan B Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on an ongoing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other similar information regarding Borrowers.

11.5. INDEMNIFICATION.

         11.5.1. Lenders agree to indemnify Administrative Agent (to the extent
not reimbursed by Borrowers), pro rata in accordance with their respective
Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by
Administrative Agent under this Agreement; provided that no Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse Administrative
Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share, as set forth above, of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiation, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement and each other Loan Document, to the
extent that Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by




                                       70
<PAGE>

Borrowers. The obligations of Lenders under this subsection 11.5.1 shall survive
the payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. If
after payment and distribution of any amount by Administrative Agent to Lenders,
any Lender or any other Person, including any Borrower, any creditor of any
Borrower, a liquidator, administrator or trustee in bankruptcy, recovers from
Administrative Agent any amount found to have been wrongfully paid to
Administrative Agent or disbursed by Administrative Agent to Lenders, then each
Lender, ratably in accordance with the percentage of the amount disbursed to
such Lender, shall reimburse Administrative Agent for all such amounts.

         11.5.2. Term Loan B Lenders agree to indemnify Term Loan B Agent (to
the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers), in accordance with their respective
Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against Term Loan B Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by Term Loan
B Agent under this Agreement; provided that no Term Loan B Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from Term Loan B Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Term Loan B Lender agrees to reimburse Term
Loan B Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share, as set forth above, of
any out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Term Loan B
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiation, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement and each other Loan Document, to the
extent that Term Loan B Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrowers.
The obligations of Term Loan B Lenders under this subsection 11.5.2 shall
survive the payment in full of all Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement. If after payment and distribution of any amount by Term Loan B Agent
to Term Loan B Lenders, any Term Loan B Lender or any other Person, including
any Borrower, any creditor of any Borrower, a liquidator, administrator or
trustee in bankruptcy, recovers from Term Loan B Agent any amount found to have
been wrongfully paid to Term Loan B Agent or disbursed by Term Loan B Agent to
Term Loan B Lenders, then each Term Loan B Lender, ratably in accordance with
the percentage of the amount disbursed to such Term Loan B Lender, shall
reimburse Term Loan B Agent for all such amounts.

11.6. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES TO BE EXERCISED BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ONLY. Each
Lender and Term Loan B Agent agrees that, except as set forth in Section 10.4,
all rights and remedies hereunder shall be exercised solely by Administrative
and neither any Lender nor Term Loan B Agent shall have any right individually
(i) to realize upon the security created by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, (ii) to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or (iii) to make demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

11.7. AGENCY PROVISIONS RELATING TO COLLATERAL. Each Lender authorizes and
ratifies Administrative Agent's entry into this Agreement and the Security
Documents for the benefit of Lenders. Each Lender agrees that any action taken
by Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or the Security Documents, and the exercise by
Administrative Agent of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and
binding upon all Lenders. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of
all Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any



                                       71
<PAGE>

Lender to take any action with respect to any Collateral or the Loan Documents
which may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected Administrative Agent's
Liens upon the Collateral, for its benefit and the ratable benefit of Lenders.
Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in
its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Administrative Agent
upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Agreement and payment and
satisfaction of all Obligations other than any Obligations (excluding
Obligations to Term Loan B Agent and Term Loan B Lenders) which have been cash
collateralized or covered by a letter of credit satisfactory to Administrative
Agent; or (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if Borrower
Representative certifies to Administrative Agent that the sale or disposition is
made in compliance with subsection 8.2.9 hereof (and Administrative Agent may
rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or (iii)
constituting property in which a Borrower owned no interest at the time the Lien
was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) in connection with any
foreclosure sale or other disposition of Collateral after the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default or (v) if approved, authorized or
ratified in writing by Administrative Agent at the direction of Lenders holding
the requisite amount of Obligations set forth in Section 11.10; or (vi) with
respect to the Senior Noteholder Priority Collateral, contemporaneously with the
release of the Lien thereon securing the New Senior Secured Notes. Upon request
by Administrative Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm in writing
Administrative Agent's authority to release particular types or items of
Collateral pursuant hereto. Administrative Agent shall have no obligation
whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral
exists or is owned by a Borrower or is cared for, protected or insured or has
been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent herein or
pursuant to the Security Documents have been properly or sufficiently or
lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any
particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under
any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of its
rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Administrative Agent in
this Section 11.7 or in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and
agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related
thereto, Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in
its sole discretion, but consistent with the provisions of this Agreement,
including given Administrative Agent's own interest in the Collateral as a
Lender and that Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever
to any Lender other than for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

11.8. RIGHT TO PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.

         11.8.1. Administrative Agent shall have the right, but shall not be
obligated, at any time upon written notice to any Lender and with the consent of
such Lender, which may be granted or withheld in such Lender's sole discretion,
to purchase for Administrative Agent's own account all of such Lender's
interests in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Obligations, for
the face amount of the outstanding Obligations owed to such Lender, including
without limitation all accrued and unpaid interest and fees.

         11.8.2. TERM LOAN B LENDER PURCHASE OPTION.

         Commitments based on an Event of Default under the Loan Documents; (ii)
         any of the Obligations owing to the Term Loan B Lenders shall not be
         paid in full when due and owing; or (iii) the Administrative Agent
         shall otherwise have exercised remedies or commenced any enforcement
         actions in accordance with the Loan Documents, the Term Loan B Lenders
         shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon 5 Business Days
         advance written notice from the Term Loan B Agent (a "COMMITTED BUY-OUT
         NOTICE") to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving
         Credit Lenders, to acquire from the Revolving Credit Lenders all (but
         not less than all) of the right, title, and interest of the Revolving
         Credit Lenders in and to the Obligations owing to the Revolving Credit
         Lenders, the Revolving Credit Commitments and the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent, for the
         benefit of the Revolving Credit Lenders, of the Committed Buy-Out
         Notice, those Term Loan B Lenders that have elected in writing to
         participate in the purchase option set forth in this subsection 11.8.2
         (the "Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders") irrevocably shall be committed
         to acquire, within 5 Business Days following such receipt, from the
         Revolving Credit Lenders all (but not less than all) of the right,
         title, and interest of the Revolving Credit Lenders in and to the

         purchase price equal to: 100% of the outstanding balance with respect
         thereto, including, without limitation, principal, interest accrued and
         unpaid thereon and any unpaid fees and premiums (other than any
         prepayment premium, unless and to the extent that the Revolving Credit
         Lenders are entitled to receive a portion of such prepayment premium
         pursuant to the proviso set forth at the end of this paragraph),
         unreimbursed obligations with respect to Letters of Credit owing to the
         Revolving Credit Lenders which may include the cash collateralization
         of obligations with respect to undrawn Letters of Credit in an amount
         not to exceed 105% thereof, and Product Obligations in an amount not to
         exceed 105% of the Product Obligations to the extent that such Product

         10.2.2, and all expenses to the extent earned or due and payable in
         accordance with the Loan Documents (including the reimbursement of
         extraordinary expenses, financial examination expenses, and appraisal
         fees); whereupon each of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall assign to
         the Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders, without any representation,
         recourse, or warranty whatsoever (except that each of the Revolving





                                       73
<PAGE>

         Credit Lenders shall warrant to the Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders that
         (1) the amount quoted by such Revolving Credit Lender as its portion of
         the purchase price represents the amount shown as due with respect to
         the claims transferred as reflected on its books and records, (2) it
         owns, or has the right to transfer to the Purchasing Term Loan B
         Lenders, the rights being transferred, and (3) such transfer will be
         free and clear of Liens and adverse claims), its right, title, and
         interest with respect to the Obligations owing to the Revolving Credit
         Lenders, the Revolving Credit Commitments and the Loan Documents, at no
         expense to the Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders other than the
         reimbursement by the Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders of the reasonable
         out-of-pocket expenses of the Revolving Credit Lenders and the legal
         counsel thereof in connection with documenting and effecting such
         assignment and the related delivery to the Purchasing Term Loan B
         Lenders of the original Loan Documents in the possession of the
         Revolving Credit Lenders, and, in connection with such assignment, the
         Revolving Credit Lenders shall deliver to the Purchasing Term Loan B
         Lenders any original Loan Documents and any Collateral in their
         possession and execute such other documents, instruments, and
         agreements reasonably necessary to effect such assignment; PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER, that, if (i) any prepayment premium is received in cash, (ii)
         all other Obligations (other than the Product Claims, as defined below)
         are repaid in full, and (iii) all Revolving Credit Commitments under
         this Agreement are terminated, then the Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders
         shall pay a supplemental purchase price in respect of the Purchasing
         Term Loan B Lenders' purchase under this Section 11.8.2 in an amount
         equal to the portion of the prepayment premium to which the Revolving
         Credit Lenders would have been entitled had the purchase under this
         Section 11.8.2 not occurred; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no prepayment
         premium shall be paid in respect of the Term Loan B before the
         Revolving Credit Lenders receive the entire amount of the prepayment
         premium to which the Revolving Credit Lenders would have been entitled
         had the purchase under this Section 11.8.2 not occurred.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Revolving Credit Lenders and
         their Affiliates shall not transfer, and the Purchasing Term Loan B
         Lenders shall not acquire, any claims in respect of Product Obligations
         which, in accordance with subsection 3.4.3 or 10.2.2, are to be repaid
         after the Obligations with respect to the Term Loan B (the "Product
         Claims"), (y) such Product Claims shall remain secured by the
         Collateral and the Term Loan B Agent hereby agrees to act as collateral
         agent for the Revolving Credit Lenders and their Affiliates in respect
         of such Product Claims and (z) the Revolving Credit Lenders and their
         Affiliates shall be entitled to payment in respect of such Product
         Claims in accordance with the provisions of subsection 3.4.3 or 10.2.2,
         as applicable.

                  (c) In the event that the Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders elect
         to acquire all (but not less than all) of the remaining right, title,
         and interest of the Revolving Credit Lenders in and to the Obligations
         owing to the Revolving Credit Lenders, the Revolving Credit Commitments
         and the Loan Documents pursuant to this Section 11.8.2 (the "PURCHASE
         OPTION"), the Administrative Agent shall resign under Section 11.11,
         effective immediately upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of
         written notice by the Term Loan B Agent of the exercise by the
         Purchasing Term Loan B Lenders of the Purchase Option.

11.9. RIGHT OF SALE, ASSIGNMENT, PARTICIPATIONS. Borrowers hereby consent to any
Lender's participation, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, at any
time or times hereafter, of this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents,
or of any portion hereof or thereof, including, without limitation, such
Lender's rights, title, interests, remedies, powers, and duties hereunder or
thereunder subject to the terms and conditions set forth below:

         11.11.1. Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent by
giving not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Lenders and
Borrower Representative. If Administrative Agent shall resign under this
Agreement, then, (i) subject to the consent of Borrower Representative (which

required during any period in which a Default or an Event of Default exists),
the Majority Lenders shall appoint from among the Revolving Credit Lenders a

appoint a successor agent, subject to the Borrower Representative's consent as

"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor effective upon its appointment,
and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as

Administrative Agent's and the Borrower Representative's consent as set forth

rights, powers and duties as Term Loan B Agent shall be terminated without any
other or further act or deed on the part of such former Term Loan B Agent or any

hereunder, the provisions of this Section 11 shall inure to the benefit of such
former Term Loan B Agent and such former Term Loan B Agent shall not by reason

warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii) shall not be liable for any

internal use, and not to distribute except to its participants, or use any
Report in any other manner, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.14;

Lender's participation in, or the indemnifying Lender's purchase of, a loan or
loans of Borrowers; and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold

                           SECTION 12. CROSS-GUARANTY

12.1. CROSS-GUARANTY. In order to induce the Lenders, Administrative Agent and
Term Loan B Agent to execute and deliver this Agreement and to make the
extensions of credit hereunder, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower
hereby agrees that such Borrower is jointly and severally liable for, and hereby
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Administrative Agent, Term Loan B
Agent and Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, the full and
prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and
performance of, all Obligations owed or hereafter owing to Administrative Agent,
Term Loan B Agent and Lenders by each other Borrower. Each Borrower agrees that
its guaranty obligation hereunder is a continuing guaranty of payment and
performance and not of collection, that its obligations under this Section 12
shall not be discharged until payment and performance, in full, of the
Obligations has occurred, and that its obligations under this Section 12 shall
be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by,

         12.1.1. the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability or any
future amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or
any other agreement, document or instrument to which any Borrower is or may
become a party;

         12.1.2. the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including
this Section 12) or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent by
Administrative Agent and Lenders with respect to any of the provisions thereof;

         12.1.3. the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect its
Lien against, any security for the Obligations or any action, or the absence of
any action, by Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and Lenders in respect
thereof (including the release of any such security);

         12.1.4. the insolvency of any Borrower, any Subsidiary of any Borrower
or any Guarantor; or

         12.1.5. any other action or circumstances which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor.

Each Borrower shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal
debtor with respect to the Obligations guaranteed hereunder.

12.2. WAIVERS BY BORROWERS. Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may
have now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in
equity, or otherwise, to compel Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or
Lenders to marshall assets or to proceed in respect of the Obligations
guaranteed hereunder against any other Borrower, any other party or against any
security for the payment and performance of the Obligations before proceeding
against, or as a condition to proceeding against, such Borrower. It is agreed



                                       80
<PAGE>

among each Borrower, Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and Lenders that
the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that, but for the provisions of this
Section 12 and such waivers, Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and Lenders
would decline to enter into this Agreement.

12.3. BENEFIT OF GUARANTY. Each Borrower agrees that the provisions of this
Section 12 are for the benefit of Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and
Lenders and their respective successors, transferees, endorsees and assigns, and
nothing herein contained shall impair, as between any other Borrower and
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or Lenders, the obligations of such
other Borrower under the Loan Documents.

12.4. SUBORDINATION OF SUBROGATION, ETC. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, and except as set
forth in Section 12.7, each Borrower hereby expressly and irrevocably
subordinates to payment of the Obligations any and all rights at law or in
equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification
or set off and any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or
accommodation co-obligor until the Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in
cash other than any Obligations (excluding Obligations to Term Loan B Agent and
Term Loan B Lenders) that have been cash collateralized or covered by a letter
of credit satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Each Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit Administrative Agent, Term
Loan B Agent and Lenders and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Borrower's
liability hereunder or the enforceability of this Section 12, and that
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent, Lenders and their respective successors
and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements
set forth in this Section 12.4.

12.5. ELECTION OF REMEDIES. If Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any
Lender may, under applicable law, proceed to realize its benefits under any of
the Loan Documents giving Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender
a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by any Borrower or by any other
Person, either by judicial foreclosure or by non-judicial sale or enforcement,
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender may, at its sole option,
determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of
its rights and remedies under this Section 12. If, in the exercise of any of its
rights and remedies, Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender shall
forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency
judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any
applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, each Borrower
hereby consents to such action by Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or
such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender shall result in a full or
partial loss of any rights of subrogation which each Borrower might otherwise
have had but for such action by Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such
Lender. Any election of remedies which results in the denial or impairment of
the right of Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender to seek a
deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's
obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations. In the event
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or any Lender shall bid at any
foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the



                                       81
<PAGE>

Loan Documents, Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender may bid
all or less than the amount of the Obligations and the amount of such bid need
not be paid by Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent or such Lender but shall
be credited against the Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any
such sale, whether Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent, Lender or any other
party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair
market value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and
the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the
amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this Section 12, notwithstanding that
any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of
reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Administrative Agent, Term
Loan B Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at
any such sale.

12.6. LIMITATION. Notwithstanding any provision herein contained to the
contrary, each Borrower's liability under this Section 12 (which liability is in
any event in addition to amounts for which such Borrower is primarily liable
hereunder) shall be limited to an amount not to exceed as of any date of
determination the greater of: (i) the net amount of all Loans advanced to any
other Borrower under this Agreement and then re-loaned or otherwise transferred
to, or for the benefit of, such Borrower; and (ii) the amount which could be
claimed by Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and Lenders from such
Borrower under this Section 12 without rendering such claim voidable or
avoidable under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any
applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance
Act or similar statute or common law after taking into account, among other
things, such Borrower's right of contribution and indemnification from each
other Borrower under Section 12.7.

12.7. CONTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTY OBLIGATIONS.

         12.7.1. To the extent that any Borrower shall make a payment under this
Section 12 of all or any of the Obligations (other than Loans made to that
Borrower for which it is primarily liable) (a "Guarantor Payment") which, taking
into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made
by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount which such Borrower would otherwise
have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such
Guarantor Payment in the same proportion that such Borrower's "Allocable Amount"
(as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment)
bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Borrowers as determined
immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, THEN, following
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations other than any
Obligations (excluding Obligations to Term Loan B Agent and Term Loan B Lenders)
that have been cash collateralized or covered by a letter of credit satisfactory
to Administrative Agent and termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments,
such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification
payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the amount of such
excess, PRO RATA based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect
immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.

         12.7.2. As of any date of determination, the "Allocable Amount" of any
Borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of the claim which could then be
recovered from such Borrower under this Section 12 without rendering such claim
voidable or avoidable under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or
under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law.

         12.7.3. This subsection 12.7 is intended only to define the relative
rights of Borrowers and nothing set forth in this subsection 12.7 is intended to
or shall impair the obligations of Borrowers, jointly and severally, to pay any
amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the



                                       82
<PAGE>

terms of this Agreement, including Section 12.1. Nothing contained in this
subsection 12.7 shall limit the liability of any Borrower to pay the Loans made
directly or indirectly to that Borrower and accrued interest, fees and expenses
with respect thereto for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable.

         12.7.4. The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution
and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Borrower to which
such contribution and indemnification is owing.

         12.7.5. The rights of the indemnifying Borrowers against other
Borrowers under this Section 12.7 shall be exercisable upon the full and
indefeasible payment of the Obligations and the termination of the Revolving

12.8. LIABILITY CUMULATIVE. The liability of Borrowers under this Section 12 is
in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Borrower to
Administrative Agent, Term Loan B Agent and Lenders under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party or in respect of any
Obligations or obligation of the other Borrower, without any limitation as to
amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other
liability specifically provides to the contrary.

                           SECTION 13. MISCELLANEOUS

13.1. POWER OF ATTORNEY. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates, makes,
constitutes and appoints Administrative Agent (and all Persons designated by
Administrative Agent) as such Borrower's true and lawful attorney (and
agent-in-fact), solely with respect to the matters set forth in this Section
13.1, and Administrative Agent, or Administrative Agent's agent, may, without
notice to such Borrower and in such Borrower's or Administrative Agent's name,
but at the cost and expense of Borrowers:

         13.1.1. At such time or times as Administrative Agent or said agent, in
its sole discretion, may determine, endorse such Borrower's name on any checks,
notes, acceptances, drafts, money orders or any other evidence of payment or
proceeds of the Collateral which come into the possession of Administrative
Agent or under Administrative Agent's control.

         13.1.2. At such time or times upon or after the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default (provided that the occurrence of an Event
of Default shall not be required with respect to clauses (iv), (vi), (viii) and
(ix) below), as Administrative Agent or its agent in its sole discretion may
determine: (i) demand payment of the Accounts from the Account Debtors, enforce
payment of the Accounts by legal proceedings or otherwise, and generally
exercise all of such Borrower's rights and remedies with respect to the
collection of the Accounts; (ii) settle, adjust, compromise, discharge or
release any of the Accounts or other Collateral or any legal proceedings brought
to collect any of the Accounts or other Collateral; (iii) sell or assign any of
the Accounts and other Collateral upon such terms, for such amounts and at such
time or times as Administrative Agent deems advisable, and at Administrative
Agent's option, with all warranties regarding the Collateral disclaimed; (iv)
take control, in any manner, of any item of payment or proceeds relating to any




                                       83
<PAGE>

Collateral; (v) prepare, file and sign such Borrower's name to a proof of claim
in bankruptcy or similar document against any Account Debtor or to any notice of
lien, assignment or satisfaction of lien or similar document in connection with
any of the Collateral; (vi) receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to
such Borrower and notify postal authorities to change the address for delivery
thereof to such address as Administrative Agent may designate; (vii) endorse the
name of such Borrower upon any of the items of payment or proceeds relating to
any Collateral and deposit the same to the account of Administrative Agent on
account of the Obligations; (viii) endorse the name of such Borrower upon any
chattel paper, document, instrument, invoice, freight bill, bill of lading or
similar document or agreement relating to the Accounts, Inventory and any other
Collateral; (ix) use such Borrower's stationery and sign the name of such
Borrower to verifications of the Accounts and notices thereof to Account
Debtors; (x) use the information recorded on or contained in any data processing
equipment and Computer Hardware and Software relating to the Accounts,
Inventory, Equipment and any other Collateral; (xi) make and adjust claims under
policies of insurance; and (xii) do all other acts and things necessary, in
Administrative Agent's determination, to fulfill such Borrower's obligations
under this Agreement. The power of attorney granted hereby shall constitute a
power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

13.2. INDEMNITY. Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent,
Term Loan B Agent, Issuing Bank and each Lender (and each of their Affiliates)
and their directors, officers, employees, and advisors or control persons
thereof (each an "Indemnified Person") and hold each Indemnified Person harmless
from and against any and all actions, suits, proceeds (including any
investigations or inquiries), claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be incurred by or asserted against or
involve any such Indemnified Person as a result of or arising out of or in any
way related to or resulting from the extension of the Loans hereunder or any
proposed transaction of any Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates and any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
upon demand, to pay and reimburse each Indemnified Person for any reasonable
legal or other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending or preparing to defend any such action, suit, proceeding (including
any inquiry or investigation) or claim (whether or not any such Indemnified
Person is a party to any action or proceeding out of which any such expenses
arise); provided, however, that Borrowers shall not be required to indemnify any
Indemnified Person against any loss, claim, damage, expense or liability which
is found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court to arise solely from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. No
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, each Borrower shall defend each Indemnified
Person against and save it harmless from all claims of any Person with respect
to the Collateral (except those resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Person). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
these indemnities shall extend to any claims asserted against each Indemnified
Person by any Person under any Environmental Laws by reason of any Borrower's or
any other Person's failure to comply with laws applicable to solid or hazardous
waste materials or other toxic substances if such claim is a result of or arises
out of or is in any way related to the extension of the Loans hereunder, any
proposed transaction of any Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates and any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any of the Collateral. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement,
the obligation of each Borrower under this Section 13.2 shall survive the
payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

13.3. SALE OF INTEREST. No Borrower may sell, assign or transfer any interest in
this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the Obligations, or
any portion thereof, including, without limitation, such Borrower's rights,
title, interests, remedies, powers, and duties hereunder or thereunder.

13.4. SEVERABILITY. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

13.5. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement, the Other Agreements and the
Security Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
successors and assigns of each Borrower, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank,
Term Loan B Agent and each Lender permitted under Section 11.9 hereof.

13.6. CUMULATIVE EFFECT; CONFLICT OF TERMS. The provisions of the Other
Agreements and the Security Documents are hereby made cumulative with the
provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in any of the other
Loan Documents by specific reference to the applicable provision of this
Agreement, if any provision contained in this Agreement is in direct conflict
with, or inconsistent with, any provision in any of the other Loan Documents,
the provision contained in this Agreement shall govern and control.

13.7. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all
of which counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same

appears on the Telerate page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the day that
is two (2) London Banking Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period;
provided, however, if the rate described above does not appear on the Telerate
System on any applicable interest determination date, the LIBOR shall be the
rate (rounded upwards as described above, if necessary) for deposits in U.S.
dollars for a period substantially equal to the Interest Period on the Reuters
Page "LIBO" (or such other page as may replace the LIBO Page on that service for
the purpose of displaying such rates), as of 11:00 a.m. (London Time), on the
day that is two (2) London Banking Days prior to the first day of such Interest
Period. If both the Telerate and Reuters systems are unavailable, then the rate
for that date will be determined on the basis of the offered rates for deposits
in U.S. dollars for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period which
are offered by four (4) major banks in the London interbank market at
approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time), on the day that is two (2) London
Banking Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period as selected by
Administrative Agent. The principal London office of each of the major London
banks so selected will be requested to provide a quotation of its U.S. dollar
deposit offered rate. If at least two (2) such quotations are provided, the rate
for that date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two
quotations are provided as requested, the rate for that date will be determined
on the basis of the rates quoted for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European
banks for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period offered by major
banks in New York City at approximately 11:00 a.m. (New York City time), on the
day that is two (2) London Banking Days preceding the first day of such Interest
Period. In the event that Administrative Agent is unable to obtain any such
quotation as provided above, it will be determined that LIBOR pursuant to a
Interest Period cannot be determined. In the event that the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System shall impose a Reserve Percentage with respect to
LIBOR deposits of any Revolving Credit Lender then for any period during which
such Reserve Percentage shall apply, LIBOR shall be equal to the amount
determined above divided by an amount equal to 1 minus the Reserve Percentage.

                               FINANCIAL COVENANTS

DEFINITIONS

                  CONSOLIDATED EBITDA - for any period, the sum, without
duplication, of the amounts for such period of (i) Consolidated Net Income, (ii)
Consolidated Interest Expense, (iii) provisions for taxes based on income, (iv)
total depreciation expense, (v) total amortization expense, (vi) all unusual
expenses and all other non-capitalized restructuring expenses (including costs
and expenses attributable to employee severance obligations and facility
consolidation costs) for such period to the extent not disallowed by
Administrative Agent and Term Loan B Agent in their sole discretion, and (vii)
other non-cash items (other than any such non-cash item to the extent that it
represents an accrual of or reserve for cash expenditures in any future period),
less other non-cash items added in the calculation of Consolidated Net Income
(other than any such non-cash item to the extent that it will result in the
receipt of cash payments in any future period), all of the foregoing as
determined on a Consolidated basis for Parent and its Subsidiaries in conformity
with GAAP; PROVIDED, that (a) in the event any Loan Party makes an acquisition
of any Person or any division or any business unit permitted hereunder or
consented to by the Lenders holding the requisite amount of Obligations set
forth in Section 11.10 during such period, if Parent provides Administrative
Agent and Lenders financial statements with respect to the business so acquired
(which financial statements shall have been audited by one of the "Big 4"
accounting firms or another nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent or financial statements otherwise
satisfactory to Administrative Agent) reasonably satisfactory to Majority
Lenders, Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be calculated on a PRO FORMA
basis, taking into account the elimination of non-recurring expenses, based on
the results of such acquired Person or acquired assets as if such acquisition
had occurred on the first day of such period, and (b) in the event any Loan
Party makes a disposition permitted under subsection 8.2.9 (or any other
disposition of any Person or any division or any business unit permitted
hereunder or consented to by the Lenders holding the requisite amount of
Obligations set forth in Section 11.10) during such period, Consolidated EBITDA
for such period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis, based on the results
of such disposed Person or disposed assets as if such disposition had occurred
on the first day of such period. The foregoing notwithstanding, Consolidated
EBITDA for: (i) the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002 shall be deemed to
equal to $21,720,000; and (ii) for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003 shall
be deemed to equal to $30,922,000.

                  CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO - for any period, the
ratio of (i) Consolidated EBITDA, for such period minus (x) the sum of (a) any
positive provision for income taxes (excluding deferred tax charges) included in
the determination of net earnings (or loss) for such period plus (b)
non-financed Capital Expenditures during such period, plus (c) non-financed
Permitted Investments plus (d) cash payments made within the applicable period
for non-capitalized restructuring expenses, including costs and expenses
attributed to employee severance obligations and facility consolidation costs,
but specifically excluding cash restructuring payments made on or before
September 30, 2003 which were accrued or committed to be paid on or before the
Closing Date as set forth on Schedule I to this Exhibit 8.3, plus (y) without

for each of such fiscal years and not to exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate for

period, all as determined for the Parent and its Subsidiaries in accordance with
GAAP.

                  CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGES - with respect to any period, the
sum of: (i) scheduled principal payments required to be made during such period
in respect to Indebtedness for Money Borrowed (including the principal portion
of Capitalized Lease Obligations) plus (ii) scheduled reductions of the
Trademark Advance Limit under the Revolving Credit Facility plus (iii)
Consolidated Interest Expense for such period, all determined for Parent and its
Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis and in accordance with GAAP.

                   CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE - for any period, (i) total
interest expense of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis with
respect to all outstanding Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, all commissions, discounts and other fees and
charges owed with respect to letters of credit and bankers' acceptance financing
and net costs under interest rate agreements, but excluding amortization of
capitalized financing costs related to the transactions which closed on the

                  CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO - with respect to any
period, the ratio of (1) Consolidated EBITDA for such period to (ii)

loss) of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis for such period
taken as a single accounting period determined in conformity with GAAP; PROVIDED
that there shall be excluded (i) the income (or loss) of any Person (other than
a Subsidiary of Parent) in which any other Person (other than Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries) has a joint interest, except to the extent of the amount of
dividends or other distributions actually paid to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries by such Person during such period, (ii) the income (or loss) of any
Person accrued prior to the date it becomes a Subsidiary of Parent or is merged
into or consolidated with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or that Person's
assets are acquired by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the income of
any Subsidiary of Parent to the extent that the declaration or payment of
dividends or similar distributions by that Subsidiary of that income is not at
the time permitted by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement,

applicable to that Subsidiary, (iv) any after-tax gains or losses attributable
to Asset Sales or returned surplus assets of any Pension Plan, (v) any LIFO
reserves to the extent such LIFO reserves decrease or increase net income, and
(vi) (to the extent not included in clauses (i) through (v) above) any net
extraordinary gains or net extraordinary losses.
