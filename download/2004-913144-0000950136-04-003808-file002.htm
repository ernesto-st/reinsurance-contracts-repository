to make revolving loans to the Borrower (collectively called the Loans and
individually called a "Loan") from time to time on any Business Day during the
period from the Amendment Effective Date to the Commitment Termination Date, in
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such aggregate amounts as the Borrower may from
time to time request from all Lenders, provided that the aggregate principal
amount of all Loans which all Lenders shall be committed to have outstanding at
any one time shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the aggregate amount of the
Commitments minus (ii) the LC Obligations; and (b) the LC Issuer agrees to issue
letters of credit in accordance with Article III (the "Letters of Credit"), from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Amendment Effective
Date to the Commitment Termination Date and, as more fully set forth in Section
3.2, each Lender agrees to purchase a Risk Participation in such Letter of
Credit, provided that the aggregate LC Obligations shall not at any time exceed

collateralization of any LC Obligations to be made on the effective date
thereof, the then-outstanding principal amount of the Credit Extensions would
exceed the amount of the combined Commitments then in effect. Once reduced in
accordance with this Section, the Commitments may not be increased. Any
reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to each Lender according to its
Pro Rata Share.

         SECTION 2.3 Loan Accounts. The Loans made and the Risk Participations
purchased by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more loan accounts or

                  (i) the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date;

                  (ii) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or
          continued;

                  (iii) the Type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion
          or continuation; and

                  (iv) other than in the case of conversions into Base Rate
          Loans, the duration of the requested Interest Period.

                  (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable
to Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Borrower has failed to select timely a new
Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may
be, or if any Default or Event of Default then exists, such Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall convert automatically into Base Rate Loans effective as of the
expiration date of such Interest Period.

                  (d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender
of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, or, if no timely notice
is provided by the Borrower, the




                                       22
<PAGE>


Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the details of any
automatic conversion. All conversions and continuations shall be made ratably
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with
respect to which the notice was given held by each Lender.

                  (e) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of
Loans, there may not be more than five (5) different Interest Periods in effect.

         SECTION 2.6 Repayments. (a) Subject to Section 4.4, the Borrower may,
at any time or from time to time and without premium or penalty, upon not less
than three (3) Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent,
ratably prepay Loans in whole or in part, in minimum amounts of $1,000,000 or
any multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Such notice of prepayment shall
specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be
prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its
receipt of any such notice, and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with, in the case of prepayment
of Eurodollar Rate Loans, accrued interest to each such date on the amount
prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to Section 4.4.

                  (b) If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of the Credit Extensions shall exceed the Commitments in effect at such time,
the Borrower shall make a principal repayment of Loans and/or cash collateralize
the LC Obligations in an amount equal to such excess.

                  (c) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Commitment
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans and repay or fully cash
collateralize the LC Obligations outstanding on such date.

                  (d) The Borrower shall, immediately upon any acceleration of
the maturity date of the Obligations pursuant to Section 8.2, repay the
aggregate principal amount of Loans and repay or fully cash collateralize (in
accordance with Section 3.8) the LC Obligations outstanding on such date.

         SECTION 2.7 Interest. (a) Each Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate, as the case may be
(and subject to the Borrower's right to convert to other Types of Loans under
Section 2.5), plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any prepayment
of Eurodollar Rate Loans under Section 2.6 for the portion of the Loans so
prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and, during the
existence of any Event of Default, interest shall be paid on demand of the
Administrative Agent at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders.






                                       23
<PAGE>


                  (c) Any change in the Applicable Margin, Applicable Non-Use
Fee Rate, Applicable LC Fee Rate or Applicable Utilization Fee Rate resulting
from a change in the S&P/Moody's Rating shall be effective as of the effective
date of the change in the S&P/Moody's Rating. The Borrower agrees promptly upon
any change in the S&P/Moody's Rating to inform the Administrative Agent thereof.

                  (d) Notwithstanding clause (a) of this Section, after
acceleration or, at the election of the Required Lenders while any Event of
Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before entry
of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of
all outstanding Obligations, at a rate per annum which is determined by adding
2% per annum to the Applicable Margin then in effect for such Loans and, in the
case of Obligations not subject to an interest rate, at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate plus 2%; provided, however, that, on and after the expiration
of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan outstanding on the
date of occurrence of such Event of Default or acceleration, the principal
amount of such Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event of Default or
after acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
plus 2%.

                  (e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
obligations of the Borrower to any Lender hereunder shall be subject to the
limitation that payments of interest shall not be required for any period for
which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent)
that contracting for or receiving such payment by such Lender would be contrary
to the provisions of any law applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate
of interest that may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such
Lender, and in such event the Borrower shall pay such Lender interest at the
highest rate permitted by applicable law.

          SECTION 2.8 Fees. (a) Agency Fees. The Borrower shall pay fees to the
Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's own account, as required by
the letter agreement ("Fee Letter") between the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent dated June 28, 2004 and as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may
agree from time to time.

                  (b) Non-Use Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a non-use fee on the actual daily unused
portion of such Lender's Commitment, computed on a quarterly basis in arrears on
the last Business Day of each calendar quarter, applying the Applicable Non-Use
Fee Rate based upon the daily Pricing Level for that quarter as calculated by
the Administrative Agent. Such non-use fee shall accrue from the Amendment
Effective Date to the Commitment Termination Date and shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December commencing on September 30, 2004 through the Commitment Termination
Date, with the final payment to be made on the Commitment Termination Date. The
non-use fees provided in this subsection shall accrue at all times after the
above-mentioned commencement date, including at any time during which one or
more conditions in Article IX are not met.

                  (c) Utilization Fee. In addition to the non-use fee required
under Section 2.8(b), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender in




                                       24
<PAGE>


accordance with its Pro Rata Share a utilization fee equal to the Applicable
Utilization Fee Rate times the Total Outstandings on each day that the Total
Outstandings are equal to or exceed 50% of the actual daily amount of the
Commitments. Such utilization fee shall accrue from the Amendment Effective Date
to the Commitment Termination Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
commencing on September 30, 2004 with the final payment to be made on the
Commitment Termination Date. The Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall be
calculated quarterly in arrears and if there is any change in the Applicable
Utilization Fee Rate during any quarter, the daily amount shall be computed and
multiplied by the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate for each period during which
such Applicable Utilization Fee Rate was in effect. The utilization fee provided
in this subsection shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which
one or more of the conditions in Article IX are not met.

                  (d) Letter of Credit Fees.

                  (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
          account of each Lender a letter of credit fee for each Letter of
          Credit requested by the Borrower in an amount per annum equal to the
          product of the actual daily aggregate undrawn stated amount of such
          Letter of Credit (excluding any Reimbursement Obligation thereunder)
          and to the Applicable LC Fee Rate. Such letter of credit fee shall be
          computed on a quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of
          each calendar quarter, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
          arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
          December commencing on September 30, 2004 through the Commitment
          Termination Date with the final payment to be made on the Commitment
          Termination Date.

                  (ii) The Borrower agrees to pay to the LC Issuer a fronting
          fee in an amount per annum on the actual daily aggregate undrawn
          stated amount of each Letter of Credit requested by the Borrower
          (excluding any Reimbursement Obligation thereunder) as may be agreed
          upon from time to time by the Borrower and the LC Issuer.

                  (iii) In addition, with respect to each Letter of Credit
          requested by the Borrower or any amendment or extension thereof, the
          Borrower agrees to pay to the LC Issuer such fees and expenses as the
          LC Issuer customarily requires in connection with the issuance,
          amendment, transfer, negotiation, processing and/or administration of
          letters of credit.

                  (e) Upfront Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender an upfront fee as agreed to by the Borrower
and such Lender on the Amendment Effective Date and once paid such upfront fees
shall be nonrefundable.

                  (f) On the Amendment Effective Date, all accrued non-use fees,
utilization fees and letter of credit fees under the Existing Credit Agreement
shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Original
Lenders.

         SECTION 2.9 Computation of Fees and Interest. (a) Interest on Base Rate
Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall be computed on the basis of a
365/366-day year and actual days elapsed. All computations of fees and other
interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed
(which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a
365-day year). Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which
interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day
thereof.

                  (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the
Lenders in the absence of manifest error.

         SECTION 2.10 Payments Generally. (a) All payments to be made by the
Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim,
defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed,
at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available
funds not later than 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the date specified
herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro
Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in
like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All
payments received by the Administrative Agent after 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco
time) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any
applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

                  (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due
on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing
interest or fees, as the case may be.

                  (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such
payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make
available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds, then:

                  (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender
          shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
          portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender
          in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
          respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
          available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such
          amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
          funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                  (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender
          shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount
          thereof in immediately available




                                       26
<PAGE>


         funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such
         amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower
         to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the
         "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to
         the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
         Lender's Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does
         not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand
         therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the
         Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative
         Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a
         rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the
         applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any
         Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice
         any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have
         against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

                  (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent
funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such
funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without
interest.

                  (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and
to fund Risk Participations in Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The
failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such Risk Participation on
any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its
corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase
its Risk Participation.

         SECTION 2.11 Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or
the participations in LC Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in
excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof,
such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact,
and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by
them and/or such subparticipations in the Risk Participations held by them, as
the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share
the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such Risk Participations, as the
case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing
Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its
discretion), such purchase shall to





                                       27
<PAGE>


that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such
paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without
further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject
to Section 11.9) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests,
demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect
to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the
purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

         SECTION 2.12      Increase of Commitments.

                  (a) The Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent
given not less than 45 days prior to the requested effective date, request that
the Commitments be increased in increments of $10,000,000 (but in no event may
the total Commitments after giving effect to all increases pursuant to this
Section 2.12 exceed $600,000,000). The Administrative Agent shall notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)
within two Business Days after the Administrative Agent's receipt thereof. Each
Lender (a "Consenting Lender") may, by irrevocable notice to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 30
days after the receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent, inform the
Administrative Agent that it wishes to participate in the requested increase and
the amount of such participation. Such consent may be given or withheld by each
Lender in its absolute and sole discretion.

                  (b) The Borrower shall have the right, by notice to the
Administrative Agent given not less than 45 days prior to the requested
effective date, to increase the Commitments in increments of $10,000,000 (but in
no event may the total Commitments after giving effect to all increases pursuant
to this Section 2.12 exceed $600,000,000) provided that one or more Persons
acceptable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer has
agreed to make a Commitment on and subject to the terms of this Agreement and
has executed such documents as the Administrative Agent deems reasonably
necessary or advisable to add such Person or Persons as a Lender hereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of its receipt of any notice given
pursuant to this Section 2.12(b) within two Business Days after the
Administrative Agent's receipt thereof.







                                       28
<PAGE>


                  (c) The Borrower shall not be entitled to request an increase
in the Commitments nor shall any approved Commitment increase be effective if
any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such
time.

                  (d) The effective date of any increase in the Commitments
pursuant to Section 2.12(a) or (b) shall be effective on such date as may be
selected by Borrower and the Administrative Agent taking into account any
outstanding Interest Periods to minimize breakage costs in the event of any
reallocations of Pro Rata Shares. The Administrative Agent shall notify the
Lenders of the effective date of the increase and shall provide a revised
Schedule 2.1 reflecting such increase in the Commitments and each Lender's Pro
Rata Share after giving effect to such increase. From and after the date of an
increase in the Commitments, all references herein and in any Loan Document to
the Commitments shall refer to the Commitments as so increased.


                                  ARTICLE III

                                LETTERS OF CREDIT

         SECTION 3.1 Letter of Credit Procedures. The Borrower shall give notice
to the LC Issuer and the Administrative Agent of the proposed issuance of each
Letter of Credit on a Business Day which is at least three Business Days prior
to the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each such notice
shall be accompanied by a Letter of Credit Application, duly executed by the
Borrower and in all respects satisfactory to the LC Issuer, together with such
other documentation as the LC Issuer may reasonably request in support thereof,
it being understood that each Letter of Credit Application shall specify, among
other things, the name of the account party which shall be either the Borrower
(subject to Section 5.8) or an Insurance Subsidiary designated by the Borrower,
the date on which the proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued, the amount of
the Letter of Credit, the expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which shall
not be later than five Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date)
and whether such Letter of Credit is to be transferable in whole or in part.
Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article IX,
the LC Issuer shall issue such Letter of Credit on the requested issuance date.
The Borrower shall only be entitled to request Letters of Credit denominated in
Dollars and issued solely for the purposes described in Section 5.8.

         SECTION 3.2 Risk Participations in Letters of Credit. (a) Concurrently
with the issuance of each Letter of Credit and any amendment thereto, the LC
Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Lender, and
each other Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have
purchased and received from the LC Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation (a "Risk Participation"), to the extent of
such other Lender's Pro Rata Share, in such Letter of Credit and the Borrower's
Reimbursement Obligations with respect thereto. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the unparticipated portion of each Letter of Credit shall be deemed
to be the LC Issuer's "Risk Participation" therein.



                                       29
<PAGE>


                  (b) Immediately after the issuance or amendment of any Letter
of Credit, the LC Issuer shall provide notice of the same to the Administrative
Agent and shall, within five Business Days after the end of each calendar month,
provide the Administrative Agent with a report showing as of the last day of
such calendar month the outstanding Letters of Credit, expiration dates,
issuance dates and amount available to be drawn thereunder and such other
information as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 3.3 Reimbursement Obligations. (a) The Borrower hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to reimburse the LC Issuer for each
payment or disbursement made by the LC Issuer under any Letter of Credit issued
at its request honoring any demand for payment made by the beneficiary
thereunder, in each case on the date that such payment or disbursement is made.
Any amount not reimbursed on the date of such payment or distribution shall bear
interest from and including the date of such payment or disbursement to but not
including the date that the LC Issuer is reimbursed by the Borrower therefor,
payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to sum of the Base Rate plus 2.00%.
The LC Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
whenever any demand for payment is made under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereunder; provided, however, that the failure of the LC Issuer to
so notify the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall not affect the rights
of the LC Issuer or the Lenders in any manner whatsoever.

                  (b) In the event of a drawing under any Letter of Credit,
provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Borrower shall be entitled to request Loans to repay advances made by the LC
Issuer under any Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.4.

         SECTION 3.4 Limitation on the LC Issuer's Obligations. In determining
whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the LC Issuer shall have no
obligation to the Borrower or any Lender other than to confirm that any
documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have
been delivered and appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such
Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the LC Issuer under
or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence
of gross negligence and willful misconduct, shall not impose upon the LC Issuer
any liability to the Borrower or any Lender and shall not reduce or impair the
Borrower's reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 3.3 or the obligations
of the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.5.

         SECTION 3.5 Funding by Lenders to the LC Issuer. (a) If the LC Issuer
makes any payment or disbursement under any Letter of Credit and the Borrower
has not reimbursed the LC Issuer in full for such payment or disbursement by
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of such payment or disbursement or
if any reimbursement received by the LC Issuer from the Borrower is or must be
returned or rescinded upon or during any bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, each Lender shall be obligated to
pay to the LC Issuer, in full or partial payment of the purchase price of its
Risk Participation in such Letter of Credit, its Pro Rata Share of such payment
or disbursement (but no such payment shall diminish the obligations of the
Borrower under Section 3.3), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly



                                       30

<PAGE>


notify each Lender thereof. Each Lender irrevocably and unconditionally agrees,
severally and for itself alone, to so pay to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds for the LC Issuer's account the amount of such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment or disbursement. If and to the extent
any Lender shall not have made such amount available to the Administrative Agent
by 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day on which such Lender
receives notice from the Administrative Agent of such payment or disbursement
(it being understood that any such notice received after noon (New York City
time) on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been received on the next
following Business Day), such Lender agrees to pay interest on such amount to
the Administrative Agent for the LC Issuer's account forthwith on demand for
each day from and including the date such amount was to have been delivered to
the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date such amount is paid, at a
rate per annum equal to (a) for the first three days after demand, the Federal
Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (b) thereafter, the Base Rate from
time to time in effect. Any Lender's failure to make available to the
Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of any such payment or disbursement
shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available
to the Administrative Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
available to the Administrative Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of any
such payment or disbursement.

                  (b) If any amount received by the LC Issuer on account of any
payment with respect to any Risk Participation, any Reimbursement Obligation or
any other Obligation shall be avoided, rescinded or otherwise returned or paid
over by the LC Issuer for any reason at any time, whether before or after the
termination of this Agreement (or the LC Issuer believes in good faith that such
avoidance, rescission, return or payment is required, whether or not such matter
has been adjudicated), each Lender will (except to the extent a corresponding
amount received by such Lender on account of its Risk Participation relating to
the same payment on a Letter of Credit has been avoided, rescinded or otherwise
returned or paid over by such Lender), promptly upon notice from the
Administrative Agent or the LC Issuer, pay over to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the LC Issuer its Pro Rata Share of such amount, together with
its Pro Rata Share of any interest or penalties payable with respect thereto.

         SECTION 3.6 Warranty. The delivery of each Letter of Credit Application
pursuant to Section 3.1 and each request for amendment or extension of an
existing Letter of Credit shall automatically constitute a warranty by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent and each Lender to the effect that on the
date of such requested Credit Extension that the conditions of Section 9.2 have
been satisfied.

         SECTION 3.7 Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the LC Issuer for any payment made by the LC Issuer under any Letter
of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower, shall be unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the applicable Letter of Credit Application and any other applicable
agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including without limitation
the following circumstances:




                                       31
<PAGE>


                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
         Document, any Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument
         relating thereto (all of the foregoing being, collectively, the "LC
         Related Documents");

                  (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the Borrower or
         any other Person in respect of any LC Related Document or any other
         amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of
         the LC Related Documents;

                  (iii) subject to Section 3.4, the existence of any claim,
         set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower or any other Person
         may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a
         Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such beneficiary or any
         such transferee may be acting), the LC Issuer or any other Person,
         whether in connection with the transactions contemplated by the LC
         Related Documents or any unrelated transaction (including any
         underlying transaction between any Credit Party and the beneficiary
         named in any such Letter of Credit);

                  (iv) subject to Section 3.4, any statement or any other
         document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
         fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect, any statement
         therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, any errors,
         omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
         messages, by mail, telecopier or otherwise, or any errors in
         translation or in interpretation of technical terms;

                  (v) subject to Section 3.4, payment by the LC Issuer under a
         Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that
         does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any
         defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit
         to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit (provided that any
         draft, certificate or other document presented pursuant to such Letter
         of Credit appears on its face to comply with the terms thereof), any
         non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary or any transferee
         of the proceeds of such drawing or any other act or omission of such
         beneficiary or transferee in connection with such Letter of Credit;

                  (vi) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or

                  (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
         or not similar to any of the foregoing, including without limitation
         any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense
         available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower.

         SECTION 3.8 Letter of Credit Collateral Account. The Borrower agrees
that it will, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders and until the final expiration date of any Letter of Credit and
thereafter so long as any Obligations are payable hereunder, maintain a special
collateral account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent (the "LC Collateral Account") at the Administrative Agent's office in the
name of the Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuer and the Lenders and the
Borrower shall have no interest therein




                                       32
<PAGE>


except as set forth in Section 8.3. The Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and
grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuer and the
Lenders, a security interest in all of the Borrower's right, title and interest
in and to the LC Collateral Account, all funds and Permitted Investments which
may from time to time be on deposit in the LC Collateral Account to secure the
prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations. The
Administrative Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the
LC Collateral Account in Permitted Investments (other than those described in
clause (i) of the definition thereof) having a maturity not exceeding 30 days.
Funds earned on such Permitted Investments shall be deposited into the LC
Collateral Account. Nothing in this Section 3.8 shall require the Borrower to
deposit any funds in the LC Collateral Account or limit the right of the
Administrative Agent to release any funds held in the LC Collateral Account in
each case other than as required by Section 2.6 or Article 8.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         SECTION 4.1 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to each
Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and any
other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for any Taxes. In addition, the Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes.

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Lender, the LC Issuer and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes
or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Lender or the Administrative
Agent and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the
Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.

                  (c) If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent, then:

                  (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
         after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
         deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under
         this Section) such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent,
         as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
         received had no such deductions or withholdings been made;

                  (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;

                  (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or
         withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
         accordance with applicable law; and





                                       33
<PAGE>


                  (iv) the Borrower shall also pay, without duplication, to each
         Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent for the account of
         such Person, at the time interest is paid, all additional amounts which
         the respective Person specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax
         yield the Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had
         not been imposed.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the
Borrower of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish the Administrative
Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof,
or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to
any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
4.1(c), then such Person shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and
regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as
to eliminate any such additional payment by the Borrower which may thereafter
accrue, if such change in the judgment of such Person is not otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender or inconsistent with such Person's internal
policies.

         SECTION 4.2 Illegality. (a) If any Lender determines that the
introduction of any Requirements of Law, or any change in any Requirements of
Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirements of Law, has
made it unlawful in each case, after the date hereof, or that any central bank
or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender
or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice
thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any
obligation of that Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until
the Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

                  (b) If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrower shall, upon its receipt of notice of such
fact and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
prepay in full such Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Lender then outstanding,
together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 4.4,
either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if the Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or
immediately, if the Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar
Rate Loan. If the Borrower is required to so prepay any Eurodollar Rate Loan,
then concurrently with such prepayment, the Borrower shall borrow from the
affected Lender, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.

                  (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Loans has been so terminated or suspended, the Borrower may
elect, by giving notice to the Lender through the Administrative Agent that all
Loans which would otherwise be made by the Lender as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be instead Base Rate Loans.




                                       34
<PAGE>


                  (d) Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent under
this Section, the affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office
with respect to its Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the
need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment
of such Lender, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or
inconsistent with such Lender's internal policies.

         SECTION 4.3 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. (a) If any Lender
determines that after the date hereof due to either (i) the introduction of or
any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve
requirements included in the calculation of the Eurodollar Rate) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance by the LC Issuer
or such Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding
or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans, then the Borrower shall be liable for,
and shall from time to time, within five Business Days after demand, which
demand shall include the certificate required by Section 4.6 (with a copy of
such demand to be sent to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such increased costs; provided that the Borrower
shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts which were incurred by such
Lender more than 90 days prior to the date of such request.

                  (b) If the LC Issuer or any Lender shall have determined that
after the date hereof (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation,
(ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the
interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any
central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by the LC Issuer or such Lender (or
its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling the LC Issuer or such Lender
with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by the LC Issuer or such Lender or
any corporation controlling the LC Issuer or such Lender and (taking into
consideration the LC Issuer's or such Lender's or such corporation's policies
with respect to capital adequacy and the LC Issuer or such Lender's desired
return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased or
its rate of return is decreased as a consequence of its Commitment, loans,
credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, within five Business Days
after demand, which demand shall include the certificate required by Section 4.6
of the LC Issuer or such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower shall pay to the LC Issuer or such Lender, from time to time
as specified by the Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate the LC
Issuer or such Lender for such increase; provided that the Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay any additional amounts which were incurred by the LC Issuer or
such Lender more than 90 days prior to the date of such request.

         SECTION 4.4 Funding Losses. The Borrower shall reimburse each Lender
and hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of:




                                       35
<PAGE>


                  (a) the failure of the Borrower to make on a timely basis any
payment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan;

                  (b) the failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert
a Loan after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of
Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation that includes a Eurodollar
Rate Loan;

                  (c) the failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment in
accordance with any notice delivered under Section 2.6;

                  (d) the prepayment (including pursuant to Section 2.6) or
other payment (including after acceleration thereof) of a Eurodollar Rate Loan
on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

                  (e) the automatic conversion under Section 2.5 of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of
the relevant Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section and under Section 4.3(a), each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a
Lender (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall
be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in
determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching
deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar
Rate Loan is in fact so funded.

         SECTION 4.5 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Administrative Agent
determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or the Administrative Agent determines (or
the Required Lenders advise the Administrative Agent) that the Eurodollar Rate
applicable pursuant to Section 2.7(a) for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent
will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation
of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be,
hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice
in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/ Continuation then submitted by it. If the
Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or
continue the Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the amount specified in the
applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such Loans shall be made,
converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

         SECTION 4.6 Certificates of Lenders. Any Person claiming reimbursement
or compensation under this Article IV shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy
to the




                                       36
<PAGE>


Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such claim and a calculation of the amount payable to such Person hereunder
and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the
absence of manifest error.

         SECTION 4.7 Substitution of Lenders; LC Issuer. (a) Upon the receipt by
the Borrower from any Lender (an "Affected Lender") of a claim for compensation
under Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 the Borrower may: (i) request the Affected Lender
to use its reasonable efforts to obtain a replacement bank or financial
institution satisfactory to the Borrower to acquire and assume all or a ratable
part of all of such Affected Lender's Loans, LC Obligations and Commitment (a
"Substitute Lender"); (ii) request one more of the other Lenders to acquire and
assume all or part of such Affected Lender's Loans, LC Obligations and
Commitment; or (iii) designate a Substitute Lender. Any such designation of a
Substitute Lender under clause (i) or (iii) shall be subject to the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

                  (b) In the event the LC Issuer ceases to be rated AA- or
better by S&P, the Borrower, at its cost and expense, may request the LC Issuer
to assign its obligations hereunder to another financial institution who is
rated AA- or higher.

         SECTION 4.8 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Borrower in
this Article IV shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.


                                   ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make
Credit Extensions hereunder, the Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender
that:

         SECTION 5.1 Due Organization, Authorization, etc. Each of the Borrower
and each Material Subsidiary (a) is duly organized, validly existing and (to the
extent applicable) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
formation, (b) is duly qualified to do business and (to the extent applicable)
in good standing in each jurisdiction where, because of the nature of its
activities or properties, such qualification is required except where the
failure to qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) has the
requisite corporate power and authority and the right to own and operate its
properties, to lease the property it operates under lease, and to conduct its
business as now and proposed to be conducted, and (d) has obtained all material
licenses, permits, consents or approvals from or by, and has made all filings
with, and given all notices to, all Governmental Authorities having
jurisdiction, to the extent required for such ownership, operation and conduct
(including, without limitation, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) as to each of the foregoing, except where the
failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within its corporate
powers and have been duly authorized




                                       37
<PAGE>


by all necessary corporate action (including, without limitation, shareholder
approval, if required). Each of the Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries has
received all other material consents and approvals (if any shall be required)
necessary for such execution, delivery and performance, and such execution,
delivery and performance do not and will not contravene or conflict with, or
create a Lien or right of termination or acceleration under, any Requirements of
Law or Contractual Obligation binding upon the Borrower or such Material
Subsidiaries. This Agreement and each of the Loan Documents is (or when executed
and delivered will be) the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Borrower
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its respective terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights against the
Borrower generally or by general equitable principles; provided that the
Borrower assumes for purposes of this Section 5.1 that this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents have been validly executed and delivered by each of the
parties thereto other than the Borrower. Schedule 5.1 sets forth all the
jurisdictions in which the Borrower and each Material Subsidiary are qualified
to do business as of the Amendment Effective Date.

         SECTION 5.2 Statutory Financial Statements. The Annual Statement of
each Material Insurance Subsidiary (including, without limitation, the
provisions made therein for investments and the valuation thereof, reserves,
policy and contract claims and statutory liabilities) as filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authority of its jurisdiction of domicile (the
"Department") delivered to each Lender prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, as of and for the 2003 Fiscal Year (the "Statutory Financial
Statements"), have been prepared in accordance with SAP applied on a consistent
basis (except as noted therein). Each such Statutory Financial Statement was in
compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law when filed. The Statutory
Financial Statements fairly present the financial position, the results of
operations and changes in equity of each Material Insurance Subsidiary as of and
for the respective dates and periods indicated therein in accordance with SAP
applied on a consistent basis, except as set forth in the notes thereto or on
Schedule 5.2. Except for liabilities and obligations, including, without
limitation, reserves, policy and contract claims and statutory liabilities (all
of which have been computed in accordance with SAP), disclosed or provided for
in the Statutory Financial Statements, the Material Insurance Subsidiaries did
not have, as of the respective dates of each of such financial statements, any
liabilities or obligations (whether absolute or contingent and whether due or to
become due) which, in conformity with SAP, applied on a consistent basis, would
have been required to be or should be disclosed or provided for in such
financial statements. All books of account of each Material Insurance Subsidiary
fully and fairly disclose all of the transactions, properties, assets,
investments, liabilities and obligations of such Material Insurance Subsidiary
and all of such books of account are in the possession of each Material
Insurance Subsidiary and are true, correct and complete in all material
respects.

         SECTION 5.3 GAAP Financial Statements. (a) The audited consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year
ending December 31, 2003 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the six months ended June 30, 2004 which
have been delivered to the Lenders (i) are true and correct in all material
respects, and (ii) present fairly in accordance with GAAP (except as disclosed





                                       38
<PAGE>


therein and, in the case of interim financial statements, subject to normal
year-end adjustments and except that footnote and schedule disclosure may be
abbreviated) the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower
and its consolidated Subsidiaries at such dates for the periods then ended and
the investments and reserves for the periods then ended.

                  (b) With respect to any representation and warranty which is
deemed to be made after the date hereof by the Borrower, the balance sheet and
statements of operations, of shareholders' equity and of cash flow, which as of
such date shall most recently have been furnished by or on behalf of the
Borrower to each Lender for the purposes of or in connection with this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby, shall have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied (except as disclosed therein and, in the case of
interim financial statements, for the absence of footnote disclosures), and
shall present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the corporations
covered thereby as at the dates thereof for the periods then ended, subject, in
the case of quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments.

                  (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3, there has been no
change in the business, assets, operations or financial condition of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary which has had or could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2003; provided, however, that, so
long as no violation of Section 7.2 shall have occurred and be continuing as a
result thereof, the occurrence of losses that give rise to or result in Excess
Catastrophe Losses shall not be deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.4 Litigation and Contingent Liabilities. (a) Except as set
forth (including estimates of the dollar amounts involved) in Schedule 5.4
hereto and (b) except for claims which are covered by Insurance Policies,
coverage for which has not been denied in writing, or which relate to Primary
Policies or Reinsurance Agreements issued by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or
to which it is a party entered into by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business (referred to herein as "Ordinary Course
Litigation"), no claim, litigation (including, without limitation, derivative
actions), arbitration, governmental investigation or proceeding or inquiry is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
threatened against the Borrower or such Subsidiary (i) which would, if adversely
determined, have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) which relates to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and there is no basis known to the Borrower
for any of the foregoing. Other than any liability incident to such claims,
litigation or proceedings and as set forth on Schedule 5.4, the Borrower has no
material Contingent Liabilities not provided for or referred to in the financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.3.

         SECTION 5.5 ERISA. (a) The Borrower and each Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, and
each Plan is being administered in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Requirements of Law, including without limitation the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material



                                       39
<PAGE>


Adverse Effect. No ERISA Event (i) has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) to
the knowledge of the Borrower, is reasonably expected to occur with respect to
any Plan or Multiemployer Plan.

                  (b) With respect to each scheme or arrangement mandated by a
government other than the United States (a "Foreign Government Scheme or
Arrangement") and with respect to each employee benefit plan that is not subject
to United States law maintained or contributed to by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or with respect to which any Subsidiary may have liability under
applicable local law (a "Foreign Plan"), (i) the Borrower and each Subsidiary is
in compliance in all material respects with any Requirements of Law applicable
to such Foreign Government Scheme or Arrangement or Foreign Plan and (ii) each
such Foreign Government Scheme or Arrangement or Foreign Plan is being
administered by the applicable Person in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Requirements of Law, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have in a
Material Adverse Effect. No event that could reasonably be considered the
substantive equivalent of an ERISA Event with respect to any Foreign Government
Scheme or Arrangement or Foreign Plan (i) has occurred and is continuing, or
(ii) to the knowledge of the Borrower, is reasonably expected to occur.

         SECTION 5.6 Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled by an
investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended. The Borrower is not carrying on investment business in or from
Bermuda for the purposes of the Investment Business Act 2003 of Bermuda.

         SECTION 5.7 Regulations U and X. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in
the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
margin stock. None of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any Affiliate of
any of them or any Person acting on their behalf has taken or will take action
to cause the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the making or
existence of the Credit Extensions or the use of proceeds of the Credit
Extensions to violate Regulations U or X of the FRB.

         SECTION 5.8 Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans will be used for
general corporate purposes. Letters of Credit issued hereunder will be used
solely to secure the obligations of the Borrower's Insurance Subsidiaries or,
upon receipt of an opinion of Bermuda counsel satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion, the Borrower, in providing synthetic cover of
catastrophe risks through one or more Catastrophe Bonds (other than Catastrophe
Bonds described in clause (b) of the definition thereof). None of such proceeds
will be used in violation of applicable law, and none of such proceeds will be
used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or
ultimate, of buying or carrying any margin stock as defined in Regulation U of
the FRB.

         SECTION 5.9 Insurance. The Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries are
in substantial compliance with all material conditions contained in their
Insurance Policies.

         SECTION 5.10 Ownership of Properties. On the date of any Credit
Extension, the Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries will have good title to
all of their respective material properties and assets, real and personal, of
any nature whatsoever.

         SECTION 5.11 Business Locations. Schedule 5.11 lists each of the
locations where the Borrower maintains an office, a place of business or any
records as of the Amendment Effective Date.

         SECTION 5.12 Accuracy of Information. All factual written information
furnished heretofore or contemporaneously herewith by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, as supplemented to the date hereof, is and all other such
factual written information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders will be,
true and accurate in every material respect on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and not incomplete by omitting to state any
material fact necessary to make such information not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which such information was provided. Any projections and pro
forma financial information contained in such factual written information are
based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the
Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts
and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such
projections may differ from the projected results.

         SECTION 5.13 Subsidiaries. Schedule 5.13 as updated from time to time
pursuant to Section 6.1(l) contains a complete list of the Borrower's
Subsidiaries, indicating which Subsidiaries are Material Subsidiaries and
Insurance Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 5.14 Insurance Licenses. Schedule 5.14 lists all of the
jurisdictions in which any of the Material Insurance Subsidiaries hold licenses
(including, without limitation, licenses or certificates of authority from
applicable Departments), permits or authorizations to transact insurance and
reinsurance business (collectively, the "Licenses") and indicates the line or
lines of insurance which each such Material Insurance Subsidiary is permitted to
be engaged in with respect to each License therein listed as of the Amendment
Effective Date. Each Material Insurance Subsidiary has all necessary Licenses to
transact insurance business or reinsurance business, directly or indirectly, in
each jurisdiction, where such business requires any such Material Insurance
Subsidiary to obtain a License. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14, to the
best of the Borrower's knowledge, no such License is the subject of a proceeding
for suspension or revocation or any similar proceedings, there is no sustainable
basis for such a suspension or revocation, and no such suspension or revocation
is threatened by the applicable Department where such suspension or revocation
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.15 Taxes. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has filed
all tax returns that are required to be filed by it, and has paid or provided
adequate reserves for the payment of all material taxes, including, without
limitation, all payroll taxes and federal and state





                                       41
<PAGE>


withholding taxes, and all assessments payable by it that have become due, other
than (a) those that are not yet delinquent or that are disclosed on Schedule
5.15 and are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves have been established, and are being maintained, in
accordance with GAAP or (b) those which the failure to file or pay would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.15, on the
Amendment Effective Date there is no ongoing audit or, to the Borrower's
knowledge, other governmental investigation of the tax liability of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries and there is no unresolved claim by a taxing
authority concerning the Borrower's or any such Subsidiary's tax liability, for
any period for which returns have been filed or were due. As used in this
Section 5.15, the term "taxes" includes all taxes of any nature whatsoever and
however denominated, including, without limitation, excise, import, governmental
fees, duties and all other charges, as well as additions to tax, penalties and
interest thereon, imposed by any Governmental Authority.

         SECTION 5.16 Securities Laws. Neither the Borrower nor any Affiliate,
nor anyone acting on behalf of any such Person, has directly or indirectly
offered any interest in the Loans or any other Obligation for sale to, or
solicited any offer to acquire any such interest from, or has sold any such
interest to any Person that would subject the issuance or sale of the Loans or
any other liability to registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.

         SECTION 5.17 Compliance with Laws. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any Requirements of Law of any Governmental
Authority, if the effect of such violation could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect and, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no such
violation has been alleged and each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (i) has
filed in a timely manner all reports, documents and other materials required to
be filed by it with any Governmental Authority, if such failure to so file could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and the information
contained in each of such filings is true, correct and complete in all material
respects and (ii) has retained all records and documents required to be retained
by it pursuant to any law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, policy, guideline
or other requirement of any Governmental Authority, if the failure to so retain
such records and documents could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

proprietary) with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of
United States Federal and state securities laws; (y) all Borrower Materials
marked "PUBLIC" are permitted to be made available through a portion of the

development shall have occurred in any litigation (including, without
limitation, derivative actions), arbitration, government investigation or
proceeding or inquiry disclosed in Schedule 5.4 which is likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) Fees. The fees referred to in Section 2.8 which are due
and payable on or prior to the Amendment Effective Date or the date of any Loan
shall have been paid to the Administrative Agent, where applicable, for the
benefit of the Lenders.

                  (e) Notice of Borrowing. The Administrative Agent shall have
received a Notice of Borrowing in form and substance acceptable to the
Administrative Agent.

                  (f) Restricted Period. If such Credit Extension is being
requested during a Restricted Period, the Borrower shall not have incurred any
Debt during the applicable Excess Loss Period other than Debt under either this
Agreement, a Contingent Catastrophe Debt Agreement or both, provided the
aggregate principal amount outstanding under all such Contingent Catastrophe
Debt Agreements cannot exceed $300,000,000.


                                   ARTICLE X

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 10.1 Appointment and Authorization. (a) Each of the LC Issuer
and each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 10.9) appoints,
designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and
to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it
by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with
the LC Issuer or any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent.

                  (b) The LC Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with
respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated
therewith, and the LC Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i)
provided to the Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by the LC Issuer in connection with Letters of
Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and
agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully
as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the
definition of "Agent-Related Person" included the LC Issuer with respect to such
acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the
LC Issuer.

         SECTION 10.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute
any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or
attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use
of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the
Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under






                                       58
<PAGE>


agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a
matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

         SECTION 10.3 Liability of Administrative Agent. None of the
Agent-Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set
forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant
for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer thereof, contained
in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of
the Borrower or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation
to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

         SECTION 10.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone
message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the
Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required
hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

                  (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 9.1, the LC Issuer and each Lender that has executed this
Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be
satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the LC Issuer or
such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
LC




                                       59
<PAGE>


Issuer or such Lender prior to the proposed Amendment Effective Date specifying
its objection thereto.

         SECTION 10.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal,
Reimbursement Obligations, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender, the LC Issuer or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". The
Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent
has received any such request, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.

         SECTION 10.6 Credit Decision. Each of the LC Issuer and the Lenders
acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation
or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries,
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any
Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether
Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession.
The LC Issuer and each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it
has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the LC
Issuer and the Lenders by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit
or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related
Persons.

         SECTION 10.7 Indemnification of Administrative Agent. Whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the LC Issuer and the
Lenders shall




                                       60
<PAGE>


indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by
or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower
to do so), pro rata, from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities;
provided, however, that neither the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall be liable for
the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final nonappealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this
Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative
Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The
undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations
hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 10.8 Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity. Bank of
America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the
account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other
business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of
America were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or
consent of the Lenders. The LC Issuer and the Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant
to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information
regarding the Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that may be
subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such
Subsidiary) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Credit
Extensions, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of
America in its individual capacity.

         SECTION 10.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, resign as Administrative
Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent resigns
under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders
a successor agent for the Lenders which successor agent shall be approved by the
Borrower. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint,
after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among
the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent"
shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring





                                       61
<PAGE>


Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Article X and Sections 11.4 and 11.5 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a
retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above.

         SECTION 10.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan or LC Obligation shall then be due and payable
as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether
the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

                  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC Obligations
and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other
amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.8 and
11.4) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.8 and 11.4.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

         SECTION 10.11 Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent. The Lenders
identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as
"syndication agent" or "documentation agent" shall not have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than
those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, no
Lender so identified as a "syndication agent" or "documentation agent" shall
have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the
Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or
not taking action hereunder.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 11.1 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with
respect to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by the
Administrative Agent at the written request of the Required Lenders) and the
Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or
consent shall:

                  (a) waive any conditions set forth in Section 9.1(a) without
the written consent of each Lender;

                  (b) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender or
reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.2 without the consent
of such Lender or extend the expiry date of any Letter of Credit to a date after
the Commitment Termination Date without the written consent of each Lender;

                  (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document for any payment of principal, Reimbursement Obligation, interest,
fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any
other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby;

                  (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
herein, or (subject to clause (iii) below) any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each
Lender directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of
all Lenders shall be necessary to amend any provision relating to or to waive
any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the default rate;

                  (e) change Section 2.11 in a manner which would alter the pro
rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each
Lender; or

                  (f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of
"Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required




                                       63
<PAGE>


to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Required
Lenders or all the Lenders, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii)
no amendment of any provision relating to the LC Issuer shall be effective
without the consent of the LC Issuer, and (iii) the Fee Letter may be amended,
or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the
parties thereto.

         SECTION 11.2 General. (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein,
all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including by facsimile transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed,
faxed or delivered to the applicable address, facsimile number or (subject to
subsection (c) below) electronic mail address, and all notices and other
communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be
made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

                  (i) if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the LC
         Issuer, to the address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or
         telephone number specified for such Person on Schedule 11.2 or to such
         other address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone
         number as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the other
         parties; and

                  (ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number specified for such Person
         on Schedule 11.2 or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic
         mail address or telephone number as shall be designated by such party
         in a notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the LC
         Issuer.

All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made
upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and
(ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of
the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after
deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic
mail (which form of delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c)
below), when delivered; provided, however, that notices and other communications
to the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer pursuant to Article II or Article
III, as applicable, shall not be effective until actually received by such
Person. In no event shall a voicemail message be effective as a notice,
communication or confirmation hereunder.

                  (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to any Requirements of Law,
have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding
on the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the




                                       64
<PAGE>


LC Issuer and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also require that any
such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original
thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the same
shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

                  (c) Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and
Internet and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine
communications, such as financial statements and other information as provided
in Section 6.1, and to distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties
thereto, and may not be used for any other purpose. Notices given pursuant to
Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 may only be delivered by electronic mail with the
prior consent of the Administrative Agent.

                  (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely
and act upon any notices (including telephonic Notices of Borrowing and Notices
of Conversion/Continuation) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower
even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were
incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice
specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient,
varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Agent-Related Person, the LC Issuer and each Lender from all losses, costs and
expenses resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly
given by or on behalf of the Borrower other than funding losses which losses are
subject to the provisions of Section 4.4. All telephonic notices to and other
communications with the servicing group of the Administrative Agent may be
recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to such recording. In addition, telephonic calls may be recorded with
the consent of the parties to such call.

         SECTION 11.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer
or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

         SECTION 11.4 Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall:

                  (a) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, pay or reimburse Bank of America (including in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) and the Arranger within ten Business Days after demand for
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Bank of America (including in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) and the Arranger in connection with the
development, preparation, delivery, administration and execution of, and any
amendment, supplement, waiver, consent or modification to (in each case, whether
or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and any other documents
prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby




                                       65
<PAGE>


and thereby, including reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by Bank of America
(including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) and the Arranger with
respect thereto; and

                  (b) pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer
and each Lender within ten Business Days after demand for all costs and expenses
(including reasonable Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection with the
enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document during the existence of an Event
of Default or after acceleration of the Loans (including in connection with any
"workout" or restructuring regarding the Credit Extensions, and including in any
insolvency proceeding or appellate proceeding). The foregoing costs and expenses
shall include all search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal
charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and reasonable other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the cost of independent public
accountants and other outside experts retained by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the
Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

         SECTION 11.5 Indemnification by the Borrower. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify
and hold the Agent-Related Persons, the LC Issuer and each Lender and each of
its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs)
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against any such Person in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such
Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect
to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any insolvency
proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of (a) the
execution, delivery, performance or administration of any Loan Document or any
other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated thereby or by the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or
proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the LC Issuer
to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents
presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit), or (c) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation
for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or
proceeding) and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all of
the foregoing collectively the "Indemnified Liabilities"), IN ALL CASES, WHETHER
OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE
INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available for Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials
obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in
connection with this Agreement, nor shall any




                                       66
<PAGE>


Indemnitee or the Borrower have any liability for any indirect or consequential
damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Commitment,
Loan or Letter of Credit or arising out of its activities in connection herewith
or therewith (whether before or after the Amendment Effective Date) except as
otherwise provided in Article IV hereof. All amounts due under this Section 11.5
shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
replacement of the LC Issuer or any Lender, the termination of the Commitments
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

         SECTION 11.6 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that the Borrower makes
a payment to the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders, or the
Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
insolvency proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived
and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or
such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent upon demand its pro rata share of any amount so
recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from
the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

         SECTION 11.7 Successors and Assigns.

                  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this
Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject
to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted
assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this
Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) Any Lender may at any time and shall, if a Substitute
Lender is designated pursuant to Section 4.7 hereof, assign to one or more
Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including
for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in LC Obligations) at the
time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the
entire remaining





                                       67
<PAGE>


amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this Section) with respect to a
Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes
Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of
the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than
$10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
the Loans or the Commitment assigned; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must
be approved (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) by
the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer unless the Person that is the
proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would
otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a
party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 11.4 and 11.5 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose
as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office
a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and LC Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

<PAGE>


                  (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any
Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
participations in LC Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.1 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a
Lender.

                  (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 4.1 or 4.3 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.1 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
11.14 as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following
meanings:

                           "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an
                  Affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other
                  Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i) the
                  Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer, and (ii) unless an
                  Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
                  (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
                  delayed); provided that





                                       69
<PAGE>



                  notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not
                  include the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or
                  Subsidiaries.

                           "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person)
                  that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or
                  otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions
                  of credit in the ordinary course of its business.

                           "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered
                  or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or
                  (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or
                  manages a Lender.

         SECTION 11.8 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that, subject to the last paragraph of Section 6.1, Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees
and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights
hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement provided they agree to be bound by
the provisions of this Section or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty
(or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower
and its obligations, provided they agree to be bound by the provisions of this
Section or (g) with the consent of the Borrower provided they agree to be bound
by the provisions of this Section or (h) to the extent such Information (x)
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or
(y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For purposes of
this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to their respective businesses, other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on
a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower. Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall
be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, "Information" shall not
include, and the Administrative Agent and each Lender may disclose without
limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the "tax treatment" and
"tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender relating to such tax




                                       70
<PAGE>


treatment and tax structures contemplated hereby; provided that with respect to
any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning
the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other
information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or
similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Loans,
Letters of Credit and other transactions contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 11.9 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders provided by law, if an Event
of Default exists or the Loans have been accelerated, the Administrative Agent,
the LC Issuer and each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the
Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Person to or for
the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all Obligations owing
to such Person, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such
Person shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and
although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Person exercising
its right of set-off agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

         SECTION 11.10 Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc. Each
party hereto shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in
the address to which notices to such Person should be directed, of addresses of
any Lending Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be
made to it hereunder and of such other administrative information as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

         SECTION 11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be
deemed an original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed
to constitute but one and the same instrument.

                  (a) Tax Forms. (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States
person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign
Lender") other than a Lender domiciled in Bermuda shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding
under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly
signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
(relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or
reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender
by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor
thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption
pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each
such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such
additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such
successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United





                                       71
<PAGE>


States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United
States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or
reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be
made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (B)
promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which
would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take
such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the
re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable
laws that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts
payable to such Foreign Lender.

                  (ii) Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
         ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
         sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents
         (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender),
         shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign
         Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of
         any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be
         necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the
         reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed
         copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such
         Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums
         paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own
         account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly
         signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto),
         together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such
         form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required
         under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own
         account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such
         Lender.

                  (iii) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional
         amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.1 (A) with respect to any
         Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the
         information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender
         transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.13(a) or
         (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 11.13(a); provided that if such Lender shall
         have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.13(a) on the date
         such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with
         respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this
         Section 11.13(a) shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay
         any amounts pursuant to Section 3.1 in the event that, as a result of
         any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
         regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
         administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
         properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
         subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person
         for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under
         any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject
         to withholding at a reduced rate.





                                       72
<PAGE>


                  (iv) The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold
         any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under
         any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrower is not
         required to pay additional amounts under this Section 11.13(a).

                  (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender
that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed
copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

                  (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the
Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case
may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any
Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including
all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the
Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 11.12 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder
shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required
hereunder.

         SECTION 11.13 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS SHALL RETAIN ALL
RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

                  (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND
BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE LC ISSUER AND THE LENDERS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN
RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH
OF THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE LC ISSUER AND THE LENDERS
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. EACH OF THE BORROWER,




                                       73
<PAGE>


THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE LC ISSUER AND THE LENDERS WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE
OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS AND IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE
SERVICE OF PROCESS BY REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS
PERMITTED BY NEW YORK OR FEDERAL LAW.

         SECTION 11.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE LENDERS,
THE LC ISSUER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF
ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY
AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT
CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE BORROWER, THE LC ISSUER, THE LENDERS AND
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL
BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED
BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING
WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF.
THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

         SECTION 11.15 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to
the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and
not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into
law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name
and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or
the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance
with the Act.

         SECTION 11.16 Currency Indemnity. If, for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to any Loan Document, it
becomes necessary to convert into the currency of such jurisdiction (the
"Judgment Currency") any amount due under any Loan Document in any currency
other than the Judgment Currency (the "Currency Due"), then conversion shall be
made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day before the day on
which judgment is given. For this purpose, "rate of exchange" means the rate at
which the Administrative Agent is able, on the relevant date, to purchase the
Currency Due with the Judgment Currency in accordance with its normal practice
at its main branch in San Francisco, California. In the event that there is a
change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Business Day before the
day on which the judgment is given and the date of payment of the




                                       74
<PAGE>


amount due, the Borrower will, on the day of payment, pay such additional
amount, if any, or be entitled to receive reimbursement of such amount, if any,
as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid on such date is the amount in
the Judgment Currency which when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on
the date of payment is the amount then due under any Loan Document in the
Currency Due. If the amount of the Currency Due which the Administrative Agent
is so able to purchase is less than the amount of the Currency Due originally
due to it, the Borrower shall indemnify and save the Administrative Agent
harmless from and against loss or damage arising as a result of such deficiency.
This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the
other obligations contained in any Loan Document, shall give rise to a separate
and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence
granted by the Administrative Agent from time to time and shall continue in full
force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in
respect of an amount due under any Loan Document or under any judgment or order.

         SECTION 11.17 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other
Loan Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the
Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

In the event senior unsecured debt ratings are assigned to the Borrower by both
S&P and Moody's, pricing will be based on the higher of the senior unsecured
debt ratings from either S&P or Moody's in the event of a single split rating,
and one Pricing Level below the higher rating in the event of a double (or more)
split rating. If no senior unsecured debt rating has been assigned, Pricing
Level I shall apply.
