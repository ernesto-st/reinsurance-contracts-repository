respect to the calculation of outstanding amounts (but not with respect to funding or repayment)
under Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit denominated in HK Dollars or Patacas, the reference
Exchange Rate shall be determined as follows: (a)&nbsp;with respect to HK Dollars, the middle HKD/USD
rate as announced daily by the Hong Kong Treasury Market Association and shown on the Reuter&#146;s
HKDFIX page at 11:15&nbsp;A.M. Hong Kong time on the applicable date (the
&#147;Mid HKD/USD Rate&#148;), and (b)&nbsp;with respect to Patacas, the product (to the nearest four decimal
points) of (i)&nbsp;the Mid HKD/USD Rate and (ii)&nbsp;the middle MOP/HKD rate as announced daily by the
Monetary Authority of Macau and shown on the Reuter&#146;s AMCM page at 11:00&nbsp;A.M. Hong Kong time. For
example, assume that on a determination date the Mid HKD/USD Rate is 7.7587, and the AMCM page for
that date shows MOP/HKD at 1.029 &#151; 1.031 (whereas the mid rate would be 1.030). Thus the
applicable reference rate for MOP/USD would be calculated to be 7.7587 x 1.0300 = 7.9915.

representation is made or deemed made to develop, construct, complete, own and operate the Project,
in accordance with all Legal Requirements and the Project Schedule and relevant Project Documents.
The Administrative Agent has received a true, complete and correct copy of each of the Project
Documents in effect as of the date this representation is made or deemed made (including all
exhibits, schedules, side letters and disclosure letters referred to therein or delivered pursuant
thereto, if any). All conditions precedent to the obligations of the respective parties (other

such conditions precedent (a)&nbsp;the failure of which to be satisfied could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b)&nbsp;which by their terms cannot be met until a later stage in

subsection 6.23A (the &#147;<B>Permit Schedule</B>&#148;). The Permit Schedule for the Project accurately states
the stage in construction by which each such Permit is required to be obtained. Each material
Permit described in the Permit Schedule as required to be obtained by each date that this
representation is deemed to be made has either (i)&nbsp;been received and is in full force and effect,
and not subject to current legal proceedings or to any unsatisfied conditions (that are required to
be satisfied by such date) that could reasonably be expected to result in material modification or
revocation, and all applicable appeal periods with respect thereto have expired without any action
being taken by any applicable Governmental Authority, or (ii)&nbsp;subject to the consent of the
Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), been received pending the
expiration of any such applicable waiting or appeal period, and is reasonably expected to be
obtained upon the termination of such waiting or appeal period. No fact or circumstance exists
which indicates that any Permit described in the Permit Schedule not required to have been obtained
by the date that this representation is deemed to be made will not be obtained prior to the time
that it becomes required. Neither the Borrower nor, to Borrower&#146;s knowledge, any other party
involved in the Project is in violation of any condition in any Permit the effect of which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Gaming Concession Contract and the
Land Concession Contract are in full force and effect (except that the Land Concession Contract
shall be permitted to be &#147;provisional&#148; as required by applicable law until 180&nbsp;days after the
Project Final Completion Date; <U>provided</U>, that if any destruction or damage to any material

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect
to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the
nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If the rate of
interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time
exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear
interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the
amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in
this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are
repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for
above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated
rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent
permitted by law, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference
between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the
Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the
intention of Lenders and Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly,
if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which
constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be
cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender&#146;s option be applied to the
outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Borrower.
