requires, capitalized words and phrases used in the other Loan Documents have the meanings provided below. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Adjusted LIBOR Rate</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> shall mean, with respect to any LIBOR Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards,
if necessary, to the next <SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>16</SMALL> of 1%) equal to the sum of (a)&nbsp;the product of (i)&nbsp;the LIBOR Rate in effect for such Interest Period and (ii)&nbsp;Statutory Reserves and

Date through and including completion of the Spin-off Transaction. After the completion of the Spin-off Transaction, the Credit Parties and Kimberly-Clark shall not be deemed
to be under common control for purposes hereof solely due to the fact that Parent and Kimberly-Clark have common shareholders. </FONT></P>

be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or

hereinafter referred to as the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Judgment Currency</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which the
Lender Parties could, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase Dollars with the Judgment Currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of
the Credit Parties in respect of any such sum due from it to the Lender Parties hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in such Judgment Currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on the
Business Day immediately following the date on which the Lender Parties receive any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Lender Parties may, in accordance with normal banking
procedures, purchase Dollars with the Judgment Currency. If the Dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to the Lender Parties in Dollars, the Credit Parties agree, as a separate
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Lender Parties against such loss, and if the Dollars so purchased exceed the sum originally due to the Lender Parties in Dollars, the
Lender Parties agree to remit to the Credit Parties such excess. </FONT></P>
