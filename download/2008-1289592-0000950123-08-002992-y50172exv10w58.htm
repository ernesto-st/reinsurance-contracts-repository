</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Any dispute or other matter in question between the Company and the Reinsurer arising out of, or
relating to, the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement, whether such
dispute arises before or after termination of this Agreement, shall be settled by arbitration.
Arbitration shall be initiated by the delivery of a written notice of demand for arbitration by one
party to the other within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If more than one reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such reinsurers shall constitute
and act as one party for the purposes of this Article, provided, however, that nothing herein shall
impair the rights of such reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint, defenses or claims, nor
be construed as changing the liability of the reinsurers under the terms of this Agreement from
several to joint.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Each party shall appoint an individual as arbitrator and the two so appointed shall then appoint a
third arbitrator. If either party refuses or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within 60 (sixty)
days, the other party may appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators do not agree on a
third arbitrator within 60 (sixty)&nbsp;days of their appointment, either party may petition the
American Arbitration Association to appoint a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall be active or
former officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd&#146;s Underwriters; the arbitrators
shall not have a personal or financial interest in the result of the arbitration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The arbitration hearings shall be held in New York, New York. Each party shall submit its case to
the arbitrators within 60 (sixty)&nbsp;days of the selection of the third arbitrator or within such
longer period as may be agreed by the arbitrators. The arbitrators shall not be obliged to follow
judicial formalities or the rules of evidence except to the extent required by governing law, that
is, the state law of the situs of the arbitration as herein agreed; they shall make their decisions
according to the practice of the reinsurance business. The decision rendered by a majority of the
arbitrators shall be final and binding on both parties. Such decision shall be a condition
precedent to any right of legal action arising out of the arbitrated dispute which either party may
have against the other. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.
