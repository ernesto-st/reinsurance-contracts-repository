officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise) and thereafter so long as Officer shall be

capacities), Corporation will purchase and maintain in effect for the benefit

disproportionate to the amount of coverage, or (ii)&nbsp;the coverage provided by
such insurance is so limited by exclusions that there is insufficient benefit
