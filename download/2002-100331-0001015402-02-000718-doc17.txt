     adjusted  REINSURANCE  CEDING  COMMISSION  on EARNED REINSURANCE PREMIUM is
     less  than  REINSURANCE  CEDING  COMMISSIONS  previously  allowed  by  the
     REINSURER  on  EARNED  REINSURANCE  PREMIUM  for the adjustment period, the
     COMPANY  shall  remit the difference to the REINSURER within 15 days of the
     receipt  of  the  REINSURER'S  report.  If  the adjusted REINSURANCE CEDING
     COMMISSION on EARNED REINSURANCE PREMIUM is greater than REINSURANCE CEDING
     COMMISSIONS  previously  allowed  by  the  REINSURER  on EARNED REINSURANCE
     PREMIUM  for the adjustment period, REINSURER shall remit the difference to
     the  Company within 15 days of the issuance of the report by the Reinsurer.
     Any verifications of data provided in the report will be made within the 15
     days  following  receipt  of  the  report  from  the  REINSURER.

     LOSS  ADJUSTMENT  EXPENSE  paid  during  the  adjustment  period  under
     consideration,  plus  the reserves for LOSSES, including IBNR, and reserves
     for  ALLOCATED  LOSS  ADJUSTMENT  EXPENSE  outstanding as of the end of the
     adjustment period under consideration, plus the adjustment to ACCIDENT YEAR
     LOSSES  Incurred  from  the  preceding  adjustment  period,  if  any.

7.   "EARNED  REINSURANCE  PREMIUM"  as  used  herein  means  (i)  for the first
     adjustment  period,  the  sum  of the Unearned Premium Reserves paid to the
     REINSURER  (less returned premium) plus the premium earned during the first
     adjustment  period  by the COMPANY for POLICIES renewed after the EFFECTIVE
     DATE  and  (ii) for the second adjustment period, the premium earned during
     the  second adjustment period by the COMPANY for POLICIES renewed after the

     actually  made  by the COMPANY, less the actual cost, excluding salaries of
     officials  and employees of the COMPANY, of obtaining such reimbursement or
     making  such  recovery)  on  account  of  claims  and settlements involving

     upon  the  REINSURER.

6.   The  COMPANY  will  immediately advise the REINSURER of all large losses by
     issuing  a  large loss notice and of all lawsuits involving (a) allegations
     of bad faith, extra contractual claims or claims in excess of policy limits
     or for liability indemnity, or (b) declaratory relief actions. For purposes
     of this section, large losses means any claim or LOSS for which the COMPANY

     proof  of loss or similar document, payment shall be due from the REINSURER
     twenty-four  (24)  hours  prior  to that date, provided the REINSURER has a
     period  of  five  (5) working days after receipt of said notice to dispatch
     the  payment.  Cash  loss amounts specifically remitted by the REINSURER as
     set  forth  herein  shall  be  credited  to  its  next  quarterly  account.

8.   With respect to all claims, suits and proceedings relating to the POLICIES,
     the  COMPANY will afford the Reinsurer an opportunity to be associated with
     the COMPANY in the defense or control of any such claim, suit or proceeding
     at  the  REINSURER'S  expense,  and  the  REINSURER  and  the COMPANY shall
     cooperate  in  every  respect  in  the  defense  of  such  suit,  claim, or
     proceeding,  provided further, that in the event the ratio of ACCIDENT YEAR
     LOSSES  INCURRED to EARNED REINSURANCE PREMIUM has exceeded or is likely to
     exceed  100%,  the  REINSURER,  at its own expense, shall have the right to
     become  directly  involved  in  the  administration  of  claims  and  claim
     settlement  decisions,  including the right to have counsel of its choosing

     party  to  the  other  party hereto under this AGREEMENT or under any other
     reinsurance  agreement  heretofore or hereafter entered into by and between
     them,  and  may  offset the same against any undisputed balance or balances
     due  to  the former from the latter under the same or any other reinsurance
     contract  between  them,  and the party asserting the right of offset shall
     have and may exercise such right whether the undisputed balance or balances
     due  to  such party from the other are on account of premiums or on account
     of  LOSSES and regardless of the capacity, whether as assuming insurer or a
     ceding  insurer,  in  which each party acted under the contract or, if more
     than one, the different contracts involved, provided, however, that, in the
     event of the insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be allowed in
     accordance with the applicable provisions of the Insurance Law of the State
     of  California.


ARTICLE  XIII.     ACCESS  TO  RECORDS
--------------     -------------------

1.   The  REINSURER,  or  its  duly  authorized  representative, shall have free
     access  at  all  reasonable  times  during  and  after the currency of this
     AGREEMENT,  to  books  and  records  maintained  by  any  of  the division,
     department  and  branch  offices  of  the COMPANY which are involved in the
     subject  matter  of  this  AGREEMENT  and  which pertain to the reinsurance
     provided  hereunder  and  all  claims  made  in  connection  therewith.


ARTICLE  XIV.     ERRORS  AND  OMISSIONS
-------------     ----------------------

1.   Any  inadvertent  delay,  omission  or error shall not relieve either party

     omission or error had not been made, provided such delay, omission or error
     is  rectified  immediately  upon  discovery.


ARTICLE  XV.          REINSURANCE  SECURITY

     shall,  at  its  expense  assure  that  adequate  security  satisfying  the
     insurance  laws  of  the  state  of California is provided. The security so
     provided shall be adjusted quarterly to equal the unearned premium reserve,
     Incurred  Loss  and  ALLOCATED  LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE reserves, including
     incurred  but  not  reported  losses.

ARTICLEXVI.          INSOLVENCY
-----------          ----------

     liquidator, or statutory successor of the COMPANY, the portion. of any risk
     or obligation assumed by the REINSURER shall be payable to the conservator,
     liquidator,  or  statutory successor on the basis of claims allowed against
     the  COMPANY  by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any conservator,
     liquidator, or statutory successor of the COMPANY having authority to allow
     such  claims, without diminution because of that insolvency, or because the
     conservator,  liquidator, or statutory successor has failed to pay all or a
     portion  of  any  claims.  Payment  by  the  REINSURER as set forth in this
     Article  shall  be  made  directly  to  the  COMPANY or to its conservator,
     liquidator,  or  statutory  successor,  except  where  this  AGREEMENT
     specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the
     insolvency  of  the  COMPANY.

2.   The  conservator,  liquidator,  or statutory successor of the COMPANY shall
     give  written  notice  of  the  pendency  of  a  claim  against the COMPANY
     indicating  the policy reinsured, within a reasonable time after such claim
     is  filed. During the pendency of such claim, the REINSURER may investigate
     said claim and interpose, at the REINSURER'S own expense, in the proceeding
     where  such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may
     deem  available  to  the  COMPANY  or  to  its  conservator, liquidator, or
     statutory  successor.  The  expense thus incurred by the REINSURER shall be
     payable,  subject  to  court  approval, out of the estate of the COMPANY as
     part  of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent that such
     proportionate  share  of  the  benefit  shall  accrue  to  the  COMPANY  in
     conservation  or  liquidation, solely as a result of the defense undertaken
     by  the  REINSURER.

ARTICLE  XVII.          ARBITRATION
--------------          -----------

1.   Any  and  all  disputes  or  differences  arising  out  of  this AGREEMENT,
     including  its  formation  and  validity,  shall  be  submitted  to binding
     arbitration.  Any  arbitration  shall  be based upon the Procedures for the
     Resolution  of U.S. Insurance and Reinsurance Disputes dated September 1999
     (the  "Procedures")  (which  are  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit XVII-l), as
     supplemented  by  the  paragraphs  below.

2.   The  Panel  shall  consist  of  three  disinterested arbitrators, one to be
     appointed  by the Petitioner, one to be appointed by the Respondent and the
     third  to  be  appointed  by the two Party-appointed arbitrators. The third
     arbitrator shall serve as the umpire, who shall be neutral. The arbitrators
     and  umpire  shall  be  persons  who  are  current  or  former  officers or
     executives  of  an  insurer  or  reinsurer.  Within  thirty  days  of  the
     commencement  of  the arbitration proceeding (or, if applicable, the longer
     period  provided  in paragraph E below), each Party shall provide the other
     Party with the identification of its Party-appointed arbitrator, his or her
     address  (including  telephone,  fax and e-mail information), and provide a
     copy of the arbitrator's curriculum vitae. If either Party fails to appoint
     an  arbitrator within that thirty-day period (or applicable longer period),
     the  non-defaulting  Party  shall  appoint  an  arbitrator  to  act  as the
     Party-appointed  arbitrator  for  the defaulting Party. The umpire shall be
     appointed  by the two Party-appointed arbitrators as soon as practical (but
     no  later than 30 days) after the appointment of the second arbitrator. The
     Party-appointed  arbitrators may consult, in confidence, with the Party who
     appointed  them  concerning  the  appointment  of  the  umpire.

3.   Where the two Party-appointed arbitrators have failed to reach agreement on
     an  umpire  within  the  time  specified  in  paragraph B, each Party shall
     propose  to  the  other  in writing, within 7 days thereafter, eight umpire
     candidates  from  the ARIASU.S. Certified Arbitrators List in effect at the
     time  of  the  commencement  of  the  arbitration. The umpire shall then be
     selected  in  accordance  with  6.7(b)-(e)  of  the Procedures. (Unless the
     Parties  agree otherwise, the ARIASU.S. Umpire Questionnaire Form in effect
     at  the  time  of  the  commencement  of  the  arbitration  shall be used.)

4.   The  arbitration  shall  take  place  in  Woodland  Hills,  California.


<PAGE>
5.   If  the  COMPANY  and  more  than  one  REINSURER  are involved in the same
     dispute(s)  or difference(s) arising out of this AGREEMENT, and the COMPANY
     requests  consolidated  arbitration  with  those  REINSURERS  in an initial
     Notice  of  Arbitration or Response, then those REINSURERS shall constitute
     and  act as one Party for purposes of the arbitration and thus shall select
     a  single  Party-appointed  arbitrator among them. (If the COMPANY requests
     consolidation  in  a  Response, then (i) that Response shall be appended to
     the  COMPANY'S  Notice of Arbitration to the additional REINSURER(s) joined
     in  the proceeding, (ii) any arbitral appointment made before that Response
     shall  be  of  no  effect,  and  (iii)  the  Reinsurers  shall select their
     arbitrator  within  30  days  of  their  receipt  of  those pleadings.) For
     purposes  of  this  paragraph, any instance in which two or more REINSURERS
     have  not paid their proportional shares of the same balance claimed due by
     the  COMPANY  shall  be  deemed  to  involve  the  "same  dispute(s)  or
     difference(s)  arising out of this AGREEMENT." Communications shall be made
     by the COMPANY to each of the REINSURERS constituting one Party. Nothing in
     this  paragraph  shall  impair  the  rights of REINSURERS to assert several
     rather  than  joint  defenses  or claims, change their liability under this
     AGREEMENT  from several to joint, or impair their rights to retain separate
     counsel  in  connection  with  the  arbitration.

6.   Unless prohibited by law, the Superior Court of the State of California and
     the  United  States  District Court for the Southern District of California
     shall  have  exclusive jurisdiction over any and all court proceedings that
     either  Party  may  initiate  in connection with the arbitration, including
     proceedings  to  compel, stay, or enjoin arbitration or to confirm, vacate,
     modify,  or  correct  an  Arbitration  Award.

7.   Each  party  shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly
     and  equally  bear  with  the  other  party  the expense of the umpire. The
     remaining  costs  of  the arbitration proceedings shall be allocated by the
     board.

8.   For  purposes  of  this  Article,  the  terms  "Arbitration  Award,"
     "Disinterested,"  "Notice of Arbitration," "Panel," "Party" (or "Parties"),
     "Petitioner,"  "Respondent,"  and  "Response"  shall  have the meanings set
     forth  in  article  2  of  the  Procedures  (Definitions).

9.   In  the event of any conflict between the Procedures and this Article, this
     Article,  and  not  the  Procedures,  shall  control.

     where  an  assessment  is made against the COMPANY by the FWUA, the FPCJUA,
     the  RPCJUA,  or any combination thereof, the maximum loss that the COMPANY
     may  include  in  the  Ultimate  Net Loss in respect of any loss occurrence
     hereunder  shall  not  exceed  the  lesser  of:

     (a)  The COMPANY'S assessment from the relevant entity (FWUA, FPCJUA and/or
          RPCJUA)  for  the  accounting  year  in  which  the  loss  occurrence
          commenced,  or

     Ultimate Net Loss any assessment or any percentage assessment levied by the
     FWEJA, the FPCJUA and/or the RPCJUA to meet the obligations of an insolvent
     insurer  member or other party, or to meet any obligations arising from the
     deferment  by  the  FWUA, the FPCJUA and/or the RPCJUA of the collection of
     monies.
