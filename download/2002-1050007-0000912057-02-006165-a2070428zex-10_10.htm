Holdings may have a defense to a deficiency judgment arising out of the operation of Section&nbsp;580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure and related principles of estoppel. Holdings waives
all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a
Guaranteed Obligation, has destroyed the guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section&nbsp;580d of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise. </FONT></P>
