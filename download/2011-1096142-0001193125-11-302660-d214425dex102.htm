billed the federal Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs for hospice services that were not reasonably or medically necessary or performed as claimed. The basis of the investigation is a<I> qui tam</I> lawsuit filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Texas by a former employee of VistaCare. The lawsuit was unsealed on October&nbsp;5, 2009 and served to Odyssey on January&nbsp;28, 2010. In connection with the unsealing of the complaint, the DOJ filed a notice
with the court declining to intervene in the<I> qui tam</I> action at this time. The Texas Attorney General also filed a notice of non-intervention with the court. While these actions should not be viewed as a final assessment by the DOJ or the
Texas Attorney General of the merits of this<I> qui tam</I> action, Odyssey considers them to be positive developments. Odyssey continues to cooperate with the DOJ and the Texas Attorney General in their investigation of us. Based on the limited

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In a letter dated May&nbsp;12, 2010, the United States Senate Finance Committee requested information from Borrower regarding its Medicare utilization rates for therapy
visits. The letter was sent to all of the publicly traded home healthcare companies mentioned in a recent Wall Street Journal article that explored the relationship between the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services home health policies
and the utilization rates of some health agencies. As part of the initial production of documents, on May&nbsp;26, 2010 the Senate Finance Committee requested supplemental information relating to Borrower&#146;s compliance program, policies and
procedures and billing manuals. Borrower has responded to these requests. Given the preliminary stage of the proceedings, Borrower is unable to assess the probable outcome or potential liability, if any, arising from this matter.

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In a letter dated July&nbsp;13, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;Commission&#148;) requested that Borrower preserve all documents between
January&nbsp;1, 2000 and the present that relate to the Borrower&#146;s participation in the Medicare home health prospective payment system. On July&nbsp;16, 2010, Borrower received a subpoena from the Commission requesting the production of
documents. Borrower believes the investigation by the Commission is similar to the Commission&#146;s ongoing investigations and the inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee previously mentioned. Borrower plans to comply with the subpoena and
cooperate with the investigation. Given the preliminary stage of the proceedings, Borrower is unable to assess the probable outcome or potential liability, if any, arising from this matter. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

Medicaid hospice services provided by Odyssey, including its practices with respect to patient admission and retention, and requesting medical records of approximately 50 patients served by its programs in the State of Texas. Based on the

the Texas Attorney General may take or the impact, if any, that the investigation may have on Odyssey&#146;s and our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. Odyssey believes that it is in material compliance with the rules

notifying it that it is conducting an investigation of VistaCare and requesting that Odyssey provide certain information and documents related to its investigation of claims submitted by VistaCare to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE from
January&nbsp;1, 2003 through March&nbsp;6, 2008, the date Odyssey completed the acquisition of VistaCare. Odyssey has been informed by the DOJ and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Texas Attorney General&#146;s Office that they are reviewing
allegations that VistaCare may have billed the federal Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs for hospice services that were not reasonably or medically necessary or performed as claimed. The basis of the investigation is a qui tam lawsuit filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas by a former employee of VistaCare. The lawsuit was unsealed on October&nbsp;5, 2009 and served on Odyssey on January&nbsp;28, 2010. In connection with the unsealing of the
complaint, the DOJ filed a notice with the court declining to intervene in the qui tam action at this time. The Texas Attorney General also filed a notice of non-intervention with the court. While these actions should not be viewed as a final
assessment by the DOJ or the Texas Attorney General of the merits of this qui tam action, Odyssey considers them to be positive developments. Odyssey continues to cooperate with the DOJ and the Texas Attorney General in their investigation. Based on
the limited information that it has at this time, Odyssey cannot predict the outcome of the investigation, the DOJ&#146;s or Texas Attorney General&#146;s views of the issues being investigated, other than the DOJ&#146;s and Texas Attorney
