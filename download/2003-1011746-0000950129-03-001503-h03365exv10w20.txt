$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify
(i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from
one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the
requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be
(which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be
borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to
which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of
the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a
Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made
as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
in any such Loan Notice,




                                       22
<PAGE>

but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an
Interest Period of seven days.

         (b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the
applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is
provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of
the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the
preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing during the Revolving
Availability Period, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to
the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth
in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Borrowing, Section 4.01),
the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the
Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i)
crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the
amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in
accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower.

         (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default or an Event of Default,
no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans
without the consent of the Required Lenders.

         (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar
Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the
Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in
Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly
following the public announcement of such change.

         (e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans
from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type,
there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to
Loans.

         2.03 PREPAYMENTS.

         (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any
time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without
premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (A) three Business Days prior to
any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of
prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof
or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.
Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment




                                       23
<PAGE>

and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly
notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the
Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued
interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

         (b) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay
Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

         2.04 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower may, upon
notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from
time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any
such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00
noon five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any
such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto
and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed
the Aggregate Commitments. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate
Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the
Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All facility and
utilization fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the
Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.

         2.05 REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

         The Borrower shall repay on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal
amount of Loans outstanding on such date. Payment shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders.

         2.06 INTEREST.

         (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate.

         (b) If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is
not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. In addition,
while any Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the





                                       24
<PAGE>

principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating
interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due
amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
demand.

         (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

         2.07 FEES.

         (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a facility
fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate
Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the
Outstanding Amount of all Loans), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall
accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as
any Revolver Loans or Term Loans remain outstanding), including at any time
during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall
be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on
demand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there
is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount
shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

         (b) Utilization Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, (i) at all
times, unless the Term Out option has been exercised pursuant to Section 2.13, a
utilization fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the Total Outstandings on
each day that the Total Outstandings exceed 33% of the actual daily amount of
the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) from and after the effective date of the
exercise of the Term-Out option, a utilization fee equal to the Applicable Rate
times the Total Outstandings. The utilization fee shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date,
and on the Maturity Date. The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in
arrears. The utilization fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time
during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met.

         (b) Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the
Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and
at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when
paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.



                                       25
<PAGE>

         (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been
separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any
reason whatsoever.

         2.08 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest for
Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime
rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall
be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in
more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis
of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the
Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the
day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is
repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a),
bear interest for one day.

         2.09 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in
the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error
of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest
and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall
not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder
to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the
Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in
addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its
Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of
its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

         2.10 PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

         (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on
the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of
such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.



                                       26
<PAGE>

         (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day
other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business
Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or
fees, as the case may be.

         (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative
Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the
Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case
may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and
may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that
such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds, then:

                  (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender
         shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion
         of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in
         immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect
         of each day from and including the date such amount was made available
         by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is
         repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at
         the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                  (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender
         shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount
         thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon
         for the period from the date such amount was made available by the
         Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the
         applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower
         shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with
         interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
         to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing
         herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
         fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
         Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
         result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

         (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for
any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of
this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set
forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.



                                       27
<PAGE>

         (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several
and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such
participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase
its participation.

         (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the
funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         2.11 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it,
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such
participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be
rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further
interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject
to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests,
demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect
to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the
purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

         2.12 EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE.

         (a) Not earlier than 60 days prior to, nor later than 45 days prior to,
the first and second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower may, upon
notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders),
request a 364-day extension of the Stated Maturity Date then in effect. Within
30 days of delivery of such notice, each Lender shall notify the Administrative
Agent whether or not it consents to such extension (which consent may be





                                       28
<PAGE>

given or withheld in such Lender's sole and absolute discretion). Any Lender not
responding within the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to
such extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders of the Lenders' responses. If any Lender declines, or is deemed to
have declined, to consent to such extension, the Borrower may cause any such
Lender to be replaced as a Lender pursuant to Section 10.16.

         (b) The Stated Maturity Date shall be extended only if Lenders holding
at least 66-2/3% of the Aggregate Commitments (calculated prior to giving effect
to any replacements of Lenders permitted herein) (the "Consenting Lenders") have
consented thereto. If so extended, the Maturity Date, as to the Consenting
Lenders, shall be extended to a date 364 days from the Stated Maturity Date then
in effect, effective as of the Stated Maturity Date then in effect (such
existing Stated Maturity Date being the "Extension Effective Date"). The
Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall promptly confirm to the Lenders such
extension and the Extension Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such
extension, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate
of the Borrower dated as of the Extension Effective Date signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by
the Borrower approving or consenting to such extension, (ii) certifying that the
terms of any outstanding Permitted Preferred Trust Securities and Permitted
Subordinated Trust Indebtedness are in compliance with the requirement set forth
in the definitions of "Permitted Preferred Trust Securities" and "Permitted
Subordinated Trust Indebtedness" herein contained, (iii) certifying that the
terms of any Permitted Affiliate Subordinated Indebtedness are in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the definition of "Permitted Affiliate
Subordinated Indebtedness" herein contained, and (iv) certifying that, before
and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and
warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the Extension Effective Date,
except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer
to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier
date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.12, the representations and
warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.13 shall be deemed
to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and
(b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default or Event of Default
exists. The Borrower shall prepay any Loans outstanding on the Extension
Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section
3.05) to the extent necessary to repay Loans of Lenders who have not consented
to the extension and to keep outstanding Loans ratable with any revised and new
Pro Rata Shares of all the Lenders effective as of the Extension Effective Date.
Prior to the Extension Effective Date, the Borrower may withdraw its election
pursuant to this Section 2.12, and if the Borrower makes such withdrawal, the
Extension Effective Date will not occur; and in such case the Borrower may
exercise the Term-Out option set forth in Section 2.13, subject to compliance
with the time periods and other requirements set forth therein.

         (c) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.11 or
10.01 to the contrary.

         2.13 TERM-OUT OPTION.

         (a) Provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower may, upon prior written notice to the Administrative
Agent sent not earlier than 60





                                       29
<PAGE>

days prior to, nor later than 10 days prior to, the Stated Maturity Date, elect
to have the principal balance of the Loans outstanding on the Stated Maturity
Date continued to the Term Loan Maturity Date as non-revolving Term Loans (the
"Term-Out"). As a condition precedent to the Term-Out, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower dated the
effective date of the Term-Out signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower
(i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving
or consenting to such Term-Out, (ii) certifying that the terms of any
outstanding Permitted Preferred Trust Securities and Permitted Subordinated
Trust Indebtedness are in compliance with the requirement set forth in the
definitions of "Permitted Preferred Trust Securities" and "Permitted
Subordinated Trust Indebtedness" herein contained, (iii) certifying that the
terms of any Permitted Affiliate Subordinated Indebtedness are in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the definition of "Permitted Affiliate
Subordinated Indebtedness" herein contained, and (iv) certifying that, before
and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and
warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the Extension Effective Date,
except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer
to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier
date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.13, the representations and
warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.13 shall be deemed
to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and
(b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default or Event of Default
exists.

         (b) During the period of such Term Loans, the Borrower may repay but
not reborrow the outstanding Term Loans as provided in Section 2.03 hereof,
except as may be required from time to time to continue the outstanding
principal balance of maturing Loans pursuant to Section 2.02.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01 TAXES.

         (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the
Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall
be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the



                                       30
<PAGE>

Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such
payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall
forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof.

         (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c) If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or
Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

         (d) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii) amounts
payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including additions to
tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment
under this subsection (d) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender
or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

         3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable,
convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if
such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate
a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the





                                       31
<PAGE>

need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender,
otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

         3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine
that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative
Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the
obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required
Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may
revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount
specified therein.

         3.04 INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY; RESERVES ON
EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

         (a) If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's compliance
therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to
make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or a reduction in
the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the
foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased
costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of
which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve
requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c)), then from time to time upon
demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent),
the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

         (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding
capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or
compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of
reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder
(taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and
such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of
such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such reduction.

         (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall
be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
"Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves
allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good
faith, which



                                       32
<PAGE>

determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have
received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give
notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional
interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice. The
Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
subsection (c) for any additional costs incurred more than 180 days prior to the
date that such Lender gives notice to the Borrower of additional costs and of
the Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, that if the
change in law or regulations giving rise to such costs is retroactive, then the
180-day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.

         3.05 FUNDING LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:

         (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of
acceleration, or otherwise);

         (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of
such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the
Borrower; or

         (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the
last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 10.16;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

         3.06 MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

         (a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming
compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such
Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

         (b) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under Section
3.01 or 3.04, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section
10.16.



                                       33
<PAGE>

         (c) Upon any Lender's making a determination that it is unlawful to
maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans and such Lender fails to designate a different
Lending Office pursuant to Section 3.02, the Borrower may replace such Lender in
accordance with Section 10.16.

         3.07 SURVIVAL. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder; provided, that with respect to amounts payable
under Sections 3.04 and 3.05, such amounts shall be deemed to have been paid if
no claim therefor is made within two years after the date that all Loans have
been paid in full and all commitments to make Loans hereunder have terminated.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender that:

         5.01 CORPORATE EXISTENCE; POWER; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and each
Subsidiary of the Borrower is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability
company, as the case may be, duly incorporated or otherwise formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation
or formation;



                                       36
<PAGE>

         (b) the Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority,
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to own its assets,
carry on its business as currently conducted, to execute, deliver, and perform
its obligations under the Loan Documents, and to issue the Notes in the manner
and for the purpose contemplated by this Agreement, and each Subsidiary, has all
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company, as the case may
be, power and authority to own its assets and to carry on the business in which
it is engaged;

         (c) the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Borrower is duly qualified
as a foreign Person authorized to do business and is licensed and in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification
or license other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and

         (d) the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all
material respects with all Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the
failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.02 CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action, and do not and will not:

         (a) contravene the terms of any of the Borrower's Organization
Documents;

         (b) result in any breach or contravention of, or result in the creation
of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which
the Borrower is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree of any
Governmental Authority to which the Borrower or its property is subject (other
than such violations, breaches, defaults or Liens which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect); or

         (c) violate any Requirement of Law.

         5.03 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION; OTHER CONSENTS. No approval, consent,
exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any

creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability, and by judicial discretion regarding the enforcement of or any
applicable laws affecting remedies (whether considered in a court of law or a
proceeding in equity).

<PAGE>

         5.05 LITIGATION. No litigation (including derivative actions),
arbitration proceedings or governmental proceedings are pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower after due inquiry, overtly threatened against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, or (b) that question the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any material contingent liabilities,
including those disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section
5.13, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.06 NO DEFAULT. No Default or Event of Default exists. Neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under or with respect to its
Organization Documents in any respect which, individually or together with all
other such defaults, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.07 FIRE, STRIKE, ACT OF GOD, ETC. Neither the business nor the
properties of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are now affected by any
fire, explosion, accident, labor controversy, strike, lockout or other dispute,
drought, storm, hail, earthquake, embargo, act of God or of the public enemy or
other casualty which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, or if any such existing event or condition were to continue for more
than 30 additional days (unless in the reasonable opinion of the Borrower such
event or condition is not likely to continue for such period) would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.08 LIENS. None of the assets or properties of the Borrower or the
Subsidiaries is subject to any Lien except for Permitted Liens.

         5.09 ERISA. Each Plan and, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge,
each Multiemployer Plan, complies in all material respects with all Requirements
of Law except to the extent that noncompliance could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect and,

         (a) no Reportable Event for which the PBGC has not waived the 30-day
notice requirement has occurred with respect to any Plan or, to the best of the
Borrower's knowledge, any Multiemployer Plan, which could result in the Borrower
incurring a liability or obligation in excess of $10,000,000;

         (b) no steps have been taken to terminate any Plan which could result
in the Borrower's making a contribution, or incurring a liability or obligation,
to such Plan in excess of $10,000,000; no steps have been taken to appoint a
receiver to administer any such Plan; to the best of the Borrower's knowledge,
no steps have been taken to terminate or appoint a receiver to administer any
Multiemployer Plan which could result in the Borrower's making a contribution,
or incurring a liability or obligation, to such Multiemployer Plan in excess of
$10,000,000; and neither the Borrower nor any Related Person has withdrawn from
any such Multiemployer Plan or initiated steps to do so;



                                       38
<PAGE>

         (c) There is no Unfunded Vested Liability with respect to any Plan or,
to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, any Multiemployer Plan, that would
reasonably be expected to have, in the event of termination of such Plan or
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, a Material Adverse Effect; and

         (d) no contribution failure has occurred with respect to any Plan
sufficient to give rise to a Lien under Section 302(f) of ERISA; no condition
exists or event or transaction has occurred with respect to any Plan which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any contingent liability with respect
to any post-retirement benefit under a Welfare Plan, other than liability for
continuation coverage described in Part 5 of Title I of ERISA, that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.10 USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS. The proceeds of the Loans are
to be used solely for purposes not in contravention of subsection 7.01(i) or
subsection 7.01(k). Not more than 25% of the assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis consists of any Margin Stock, and no part
of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to buy or carry any Margin Stock.
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is generally engaged in the business of
buying or selling Margin Stock or extending credit for the purpose of buying or
carrying Margin Stock.

         5.11 TITLE TO PROPERTIES. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (i)
has valid fee title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of its respective
material real property, and has good and valid title to all of its respective
material personal properties and assets, of any nature whatsoever which are
reflected on the audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.13 or acquired
by the Borrower or such Subsidiary after the date thereof except for assets
sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of since such date in the ordinary
course of business, except for such defects in title as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and (ii) the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries owns or holds all permits
necessary to construct, own, operate, use and maintain its respective property
and assets and to conduct its respective business as now conducted except where
the failure to have such interest or title or to own or hold such permit would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.12 TAXES. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed (or obtained
extensions with respect to the filing of) all United States federal income tax
returns and all other material tax returns which are required to be filed by it
and has paid all taxes as shown on such returns or pursuant to any assessment
received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except to the extent the same may be
contested in good faith and for which reserves have been established to the
extent required by GAAP. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the
Borrower and each Subsidiary in respect of Taxes and other governmental charges
are adequate to the best knowledge of the Borrower.

Borrower or any Subsidiary in excess of $20,000,000 or $50,000,000 in the
aggregate for all such claims (net in each case of actual insurance coverage or
effective indemnification with respect thereto). Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.14 (as updated from time to time), the Borrower reasonably believes that no
facts or circumstances known to it or any Subsidiary could form the basis for
the assertion of any material claim against the Borrower or any Subsidiary
relating to environmental matters, including any material claim arising from
past or present environmental practices asserted under CERCLA, RCRA, or any
Environmental Law that in each case would reasonably be expected to result in a
liability to the Borrower or any Subsidiary in excess of $20,000,000 or
$50,000,000 in the aggregate for all such claims (net in each case of actual
insurance coverage or effective indemnification with respect thereto).

         5.15 REGULATED ENTITIES. None of the Borrower, any Person controlling
the Borrower, or any Subsidiary, is an "Investment Company" within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Borrower is not subject to regulation
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the
Interstate Commerce Act or any state public utilities code.

         5.16 COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES, ETC. The Borrower or
its Subsidiaries own or are licensed or otherwise have the right to use all of
the patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, contractual franchises,
authorizations and other rights that are reasonably necessary for the operation
of their respective businesses as currently conducted (other than where the
failure to so own, be licensed or have the right to use would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect). To the best knowledge of the
Borrower, no slogan or other advertising device, product process, method,
substance, part or other material now employed, or now contemplated to be
employed, by the Borrower or any Subsidiary infringes upon any rights held by
any other Person, except for any such infringement that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.17 SUBSIDIARIES. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower has no
Subsidiaries other than those disclosed in Schedule 5.17 hereto, and the
Borrower has no equity investments in any other corporation or other entity
other than those disclosed on Schedule 5.17 hereto.

         5.18 SOLVENCY. The Borrower has capital sufficient to carry on its
business and transactions and all business and transactions in which it is about
to engage and is now solvent and able to pay its respective debts as they
mature, and the Borrower now owns property having a value, both at fair
valuation and at present fair salable value, greater than the amount required to
pay its existing debts.

         5.19 FULL DISCLOSURE. None of the representations or warranties made by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary in this Agreement as of the date such
representations and warranties are made or deemed made, and none of the factual
information (taken as a whole) contained in any written notice, exhibit, report,
statement or certificate furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement (including the offering and
disclosure materials delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Lenders
prior to the Closing Date), contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits any material fact required to be stated therein or




                                       41
<PAGE>

necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading as of the time when made or delivered.

                                   ARTICLE VI.
                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         So long as any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, or any
Borrowing or other Obligation shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied, unless the
Required Lenders waive compliance in writing:

         6.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent and concurrently therewith to each Lender (in accordance
with Section 10.02, which shall be deemed received by each Lender when received
by the Administrative Agent):

         (a) (i) as soon as available and in any event within 90 days (or within
the filing period required by the SEC for annual reporting) after the end of
each Fiscal Year, audited consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and
its consolidated Subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with GAAP, in each case
setting forth, in comparative form, the corresponding figures for the preceding
Fiscal Year and accompanied by an opinion, without Impermissible Qualification,
by independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing and
reputation selected by the Borrower or otherwise reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent (the "Independent Accountants"), consisting of a balance
sheet as at the end of such Fiscal Year and statements of income and retained
earnings and statements of cash flows, and (ii) in the event that the Borrower
is no longer required by Law to file annual reports with the SEC, within thirty
days after the delivery of such financial statements, a report from the
Independent Accountants addressed to the Borrower's management containing a
review of the Borrower's calculations which show compliance with each of the
financial ratios and restrictions contained in Section 7.02 and affirmatively
indicating that, while the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries was not directed primarily toward
obtaining knowledge of such compliance with these specific financial ratios and
restrictions, such accountants have not become aware of events or transactions
that would render such calculations unreliable or misleading; and

         (b) as soon as available and in any event within 45 days (or within the
filing period required by the SEC for quarterly reporting) after the end of each
Fiscal Quarter (except the last Fiscal Quarter of each Fiscal Year), (A)

Subsidiaries, and (B) consolidated financial information of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, in each case consisting of a balance sheet as at the
end of such quarter and statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows

setting forth in comparative form the corresponding figures for the
corresponding dates and periods of the preceding Fiscal Year, all in reasonable
detail and certified (subject to year-end audit adjustments) by an authorized
financial officer of the Borrower to the best of such officer's knowledge and
belief as fairly presenting in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable)
the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the date thereof and for the period



                                       42
<PAGE>

covered thereby (provided, that footnotes to such financial statements will not
be required) consistently applied (except as noted therein).

         (c) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 6.01, if
and so long as the Borrower shall file regular and periodic reports with the SEC
pursuant to Sections 13 and 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, delivery
to the Administrative Agent of copies of its reports on Forms 10K and 10Q
promptly following filing thereof with the SEC, but in any event not later than
within the periods set forth in subsections 6.01(a) and (b), shall constitute
full compliance with this Section 6.01.

         6.02 CERTIFICATES; OTHER INFORMATION. The Borrower shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent:

         (a) within thirty days after the delivery of the financial statements

that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may make to, or file with, the SEC; and

         (c) promptly, such additional information regarding the business,
financial or corporate affairs of the Borrower or any Subsidiary as the
Administrative Agent, at the request of any Lender, may from time to time
reasonably request in writing.

         Documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (b)
or Section 6.02(b) (to the extent any such documents are included in materials
otherwise filed with the SEC) may be delivered electronically and if so
delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date (i) on which the
Borrower posts such documents, or provides a link thereto on the Borrower's
website on the Internet at the website address listed on Schedule 10.02; or (ii)
on which such documents are posted on the Borrower's behalf on
IntraLinks/IntraAgency or another relevant website (including, without
limitation, the SEC's website), if any, to which each Lender and the
Administrative Agent have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or
whether sponsored by the Administrative Agent); provided that: (i) the Borrower
shall deliver paper copies of such documents to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender that requests the Borrower to deliver such paper copies and (ii) the
Borrower shall notify (which may be by facsimile or electronic mail) the
Administrative Agent of the posting of any such documents and provide to the

the Borrower shall be required to provide paper copies of the Compliance
Certificates required by Section 6.02(a) to the Administrative Agent and each of
the Lenders. Except for such Compliance Certificates, the Administrative Agent

<PAGE>

compliance by the Borrower with any such request for delivery, and each Lender

copies of such documents.

         6.03 NOTICES. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent, and
each Lender in writing:

         (a) as soon as possible and in any event within 5 Business Days after
the Borrower becomes aware of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,

Borrower setting forth the details of each such Default or Event of Default
which has occurred and the action which the Borrower has taken and proposes to
take with respect thereto;

         (b) forthwith upon learning thereof, a description of (i) the
institution of any litigation, arbitration proceeding or governmental proceeding
to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower is a party that would
reasonably be expected to result in a liability to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower in excess of $25,000,000 (net of actual insurance
coverage or effective indemnification with respect thereto), and any material
adverse determination as to liability or amount of damages in any such
litigation, arbitration proceeding or proceeding; and (ii) any matter that has
resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

         (c) promptly upon learning thereof, a description of the institution of
any steps of the Borrower or any other Person to terminate any Plan or any
Multiemployer Plan, or the appointment of a receiver to administer any Plan or
any Multiemployer Plan, or the withdrawal by the Borrower or any Related Person
from any Multiemployer Plan, or the failure to make a required contribution to
any Plan if such failure is sufficient to give rise to a Lien under Section
302(f) of ERISA, or the taking of any action with respect to a Plan which could
result in the requirement that the Borrower furnish a bond or other security to
the PBGC or such Plan, or the occurrence of any event with respect to any Plan
which could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence by the Borrower
of any material liability, fine or penalty, or any material increase in the
contingent liability of the Borrower with respect to any post-retirement Welfare
Plan benefit; and

         (d) within 10 Business Days after the close of a Material Acquisition
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, the most recent annual and quarterly
financial reports of the acquired entity which are available to the Borrower,
and, a summary of the environmental due diligence work done for or by the
Borrower in connection with such Material Acquisition (it being understood that
any Persons) engaged by the Borrower to prepare such a summary and to complete
such due diligence must be of recognized national standing in the environmental
field).

         6.04 PRESERVATION OF CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC. The Borrower shall, and
shall cause each Subsidiary to, except for any sale, dissolution, liquidation or
merger not otherwise prohibited hereby, preserve and maintain its existence and
good standing and its rights, privileges and franchises under the laws of its
state or jurisdiction of incorporation or other formation, and remain qualified
as a foreign Person authorized to do business in each other




                                       44
<PAGE>

jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.05 INSURANCE. (a) The Borrower shall maintain, and cause each
Subsidiary to maintain, insurance with respect to their respective properties
and businesses against such liabilities, casualties, risks and contingencies
(including business interruption insurance) in such types and with such
reasonable deductibles and in such amounts (after giving effect to any
self-insurance compatible with the following standards) as are customary in the
case of Persons engaged in the same or similar businesses and similarly
situated. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall maintain such insurance (i)
with financially sound and reputable insurers that are not Affiliates of the
Borrower (it is agreed that Oil Insurance Limited and sEnergy Insurance Ltd.
shall not be considered Affiliates of the Borrower for purposes of this Section
6.05), or (ii) with Affiliates(s) ("Affiliated Insurers") to the extent as is
customary in the case of Persons engaged in the same or similar businesses as
Borrower and similarly situated, provided that each such Affiliated Insurer has
in place reinsurance or similar agreement(s) with financially sound and
reputable insurance companies that are not Affiliates of the Borrower
("Unaffiliated Insurers") providing coverage of the type required by this
Section 6.05. Such Affiliated Insurers' agreements with Unaffiliated Insurers
shall provide that (A) the interests and rights held by such Affiliated Insurers
vis-a-vis the Unaffiliated Insurers shall pass through to the Borrower (or its
Subsidiary as applicable), and such interests and rights of the Borrower (or its
Subsidiary as applicable) vis-a-vis the Unaffiliated Insurers shall not be
invalidated or impaired by any act or neglect of, or any bankruptcy, insolvency,
dissolution or other event with respect to, the Affiliated Insurers, and (B) in
the event of the insolvency, dissolution or financial impairment of the
Affiliated Insurers that adversely affects the Borrower's (or its Subsidiary's)
ability to enforce such interests and rights against and receive payment from
the Affiliated Insurer(s), such payment will be payable by the Unaffiliated
Insurers directly to the Borrower (or its Subsidiary as applicable) under the
same circumstances and in the same amounts as would have been available to the
Borrower but for the Affiliated Insurer's insolvency, dissolution or financial
impairment. With respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the Affiliated
Insurers shall not retain any risk that is not covered by such agreements with
Unaffiliated Insurers.

         (b) Upon the execution of this Agreement and at any time thereafter at
the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to the Administrative Agent evidence, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, of the required insurance coverage of
the Borrower and each Subsidiary and, upon reasonable request, copies of the
applicable policies.

         6.06 TAXES. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, pay
and discharge all Taxes relating to the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case
may be, prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto; provided, that
neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary shall be required to pay or discharge
any such Tax while the same is being contested by it in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and so long as reserves have been established to the
extent required by GAAP.

         6.07 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Borrower shall comply, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to comply, in all material respects with all Requirements of
Law, including



                                       45
<PAGE>

Environmental Laws; provided, that neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary shall
be required to comply with any such Requirement of Law so long as the validity
or application thereof is being contested in good faith and reserves have been
established with respect to such contest to the extent, if any, required by GAAP
or where such non-compliance would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and obtain and maintain, and cause each Subsidiary to obtain and
maintain, all permits, licenses and approvals necessary to construct, own,
operate, use and maintain their respective properties and assets and to conduct
their respective businesses, except where the failure to obtain or maintain such
permit, license or approval would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         6.08 COMPLIANCE WITH MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower
shall comply, and shall cause each Subsidiary to comply, with all Contractual
Obligations except where failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.09 INSPECTION OF PROPERTY AND BOOKS AND RECORDS. (a) The Borrower
shall keep or cause to be kept, and shall cause each Subsidiary to keep or cause
to be kept, adequate records and book of account in which complete entries are
to be made reflecting its business and financial transactions and as required by
applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Such books of account shall be kept in a manner
consistent with GAAP if so kept on the date hereof. The Borrower shall permit,
and shall cause each Subsidiary to permit, the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders or their representatives at any reasonable time and from time to time at
the request of the Administrative Agent, to visit and inspect any of their
respective properties, to examine the respective corporate, financial and
operating records, and, subject to the confidentiality provisions contained in
Section 10.08 of this Agreement, make copies thereof or abstracts therefrom, and
to discuss their respective affairs, finances and accounts with their respective
officers, all at such reasonable times during normal business hours and as often
as may be reasonably desired, upon prior notice to the Borrower of at least 24
hours in advance; provided, however, that when an Event of Default exists the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may take the actions specified in this
sentence at any times during normal business hours and without advance notice.
One or more officers, employees or representatives of the Borrower may accompany
the Administrative Agent or a Lender or their respective representatives when
making any visit or inspection described in the preceding sentence.

         (b) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty to
visit or inspect the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's properties or to examine or
copy such records and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall
incur any obligation or liability by reason of not making any such visit or
inspection. In the event that the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall do
any of the foregoing, it will be acting solely for the purposes of protecting
the Administrative Agent or such Lender and preserving its rights under this
Agreement. Neither the Borrower nor any other party is entitled to rely on any
inspection or other inquiry by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any Lender owes any duty of care to protect the
Borrower or any other party against, or to inform the Borrower or any other
party of, any adverse condition that may be observed as affecting the Borrower's
or any Subsidiary's properties or business. The Administrative Agent or any
Lender may in its



                                       46
<PAGE>

discretion disclose to the Borrower or any other Person any findings made as a
result of, or in connection with, any inspection of any such properties or
records.

         6.10 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The Borrower will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, keep and maintain all property material to the conduct
of its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

         6.11 USE OF PROCEEDS. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the
Borrowings for working capital, capital expenditures, and other lawful general
corporate purposes not in contravention of Sections 7.01(i) or (k), any Law or
of any Loan Document.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                               NEGATIVE COVENANTS

         contemplation of such acquisition or in contemplation of the
         transaction pursuant to which such Person became a Subsidiary; and
         provided further that in either case, such Liens do not extend to or
         cover any property of the Borrower or of any of its Subsidiaries other

of current liability that may be asserted under Title IV of ERISA by reason of
the termination of such Plan and all other Plans with respect to which any such
event has occurred, shall exceed $35,000,000, or (ii) any Plan shall be
terminated with Unfunded Vested Liabilities which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) any contribution failure shall occur
with respect to a Plan sufficient to give rise to a Lien under Section 302(f) of
ERISA; or

         (i) Material Judgments. (i) One or more non-interlocutory judgments
(including judgments entered on arbitration awards) is entered against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary involving in the aggregate liability (to the extent
not covered by independent third-party insurance as to which the insurer does
not dispute coverage or effective indemnification by a third party acceptable to
the Required Lenders) exceeding $35,000,000, or (ii) any one or more
non-monetary non-interlocutory judgments that have, or could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
and, in the case of clause (i) or (ii), the same shall not have been discharged
or execution thereof stayed pending appeal for a period of 30 days after the
entry thereof, or if after the expiration of any such stay, any writ or warrant
of attachment is levied in respect of such judgment or any creditor commences
enforcement proceedings, or within 60 days after the expiration of any such stay
such judgment shall not have been discharged; or

         (j) Invalidity of Loan Documents. Any Loan Document, at any time after
its execution and delivery and for any reason other than as expressly permitted
hereunder or satisfaction in full of all the Obligations, ceases to be in full
force and effect; or the Borrower or any other Person contests the validity or
enforceability of any Loan Document; or the Borrower denies that it has any or
further liability or obligation under any Loan Document, or takes action to
revoke, terminate or rescind any Loan Document; or

         (k) Change of Control. There occurs any Change of Control, unless prior
written consent for such lesser percentage ownership is obtained from the
Required Lenders; or

         (l) Other Material Obligations. Default in the payment when due, or in
the performance or observance of, any material obligation of, or condition
agreed to by, the Borrower or any Subsidiary with respect to any material
purchase or lease of goods or services (except only to the extent that the
existence of any such default is being contested by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary in good faith and by appropriate proceedings) if such default would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

         (m) Default of Three-Year Credit Agreement. Any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing pursuant to the Three-Year Credit Agreement.

         8.02 REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with
the consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following actions:



                                       57
<PAGE>

         (a) declare the commitment of each Lender to make Loans to be
terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be terminated;

         (b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; and

         (c) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and
remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or applicable
law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an
order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the
United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans shall automatically
terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest
and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, in
each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         8.03 APPLICATION OF FUNDS. After the exercise of remedies provided for
in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due
and payable as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts received
on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in
the following order:

         First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity
as such;

         Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable
to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III),
ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second
payable to them;

         Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans, ratably among the Lenders in
proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to
them;

         Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
unpaid principal of the Loans, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the
respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them; and

         Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

                                   ARTICLE IX.
                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         9.01     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

         9.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any of
its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and
other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         9.03 LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. No Agent-Related Person shall
(a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be
responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by the Borrower or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure
of the Borrower or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof.



                                       59
<PAGE>

         9.04     RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater
number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all the Lenders.

         (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
specifying its objection thereto.

         9.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees
required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders,
unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender
or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The
Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent
has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.

         9.06 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed
to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material




                                       60
<PAGE>

information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative
Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to
enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates
which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

         9.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on
behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do
so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any
and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any
portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations
and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         9.08 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Bank of America
and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account
of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in
any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business
with each of the Borrower and its Affiliates as though Bank of America were not
the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the
Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of
America or its




                                       61
<PAGE>

Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of the Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With
respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers
under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers
as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

         9.09 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the
Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall
appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders,
which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at
all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent
of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation
of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor administrative agent
from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean
such successor administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.04 and
10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor
administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the
date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

         9.10 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

         (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, and all other Obligations
that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary
or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and



                                       62
<PAGE>

         (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

         9.11 OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS. None of the Lenders or other
Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a
"syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-book manager," or "joint lead
manager" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or
duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those
applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not
relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified
in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action
hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.01 AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required
Lenders and the Borrower, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment,
waiver or consent shall:

         (a) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01(a) without the
written consent of each Lender;

         (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any
Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.02) without the written consent of
such Lender;

         (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to
the Lenders (or any of them)




                                       63
<PAGE>

hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each
Lender directly affected thereby;

         (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein
on, any Loan, or (subject to clause (iii) of the second proviso to this Section
10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan
Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be
necessary (i) to amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any
obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate or (ii) to amend
any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the
effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or
to reduce any fee payable hereunder;

         (e) change Section 2.11 or Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of
each Lender; or

         (f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of "Required
Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or
make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
consent of each Lender;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders
required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (ii) Section 10.07(h) may not be
amended, waived or otherwise modified without the consent of each Granting
Lender all or any part of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of
such amendment, waiver or other modification; and (iii) the Fee Letter may be
amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only
by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not
be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.

         10.02 NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS; FACSIMILE COPIES.

         (a) General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices
and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including
by facsimile transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed, faxed or
delivered to the applicable address, facsimile number or (subject to subsection
(c) below) electronic mail address, and all notices and other communications
expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to the
applicable telephone number, as follows:

                  (i) if to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the
         address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number
         specified for such Person on Schedule 10.02 or to such other address,
         facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall
         be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties; and



                                       64
<PAGE>

                  (ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
         Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
         designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent.

All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made
upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and
(ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of
the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after
deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic
mail (which form of delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c)
below), when delivered; provided, however, that notices and other communications
to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until
actually received by the Administrative Agent. In no event shall a voicemail
message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

         (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan Documents
may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of any such
documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force
and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also
require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed
original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the
same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

         (c) Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet and
intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications, such as
financial statements and other information as provided in Section 6.02, and to
distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may not be
used for any other purpose.

         (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices
(including telephonic Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein,
were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice
specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient,
varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and
liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and
other communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such
recording.

         10.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,




                                       65
<PAGE>

remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

         10.04 ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. The Borrower agrees (a) to
pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or
other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including all Attorney Costs, and (b) to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including
all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in
respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney Costs. The
foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search, filing, recording, title
insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the cost of
independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 10.04
shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and
repayment of all other Obligations.

         10.05 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BORROWER. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact
(collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind
or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or
in connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or
administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or instrument
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment or
Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (c) any actual or
alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or
any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, or (d) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or
any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of
any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), in all cases, whether or not
caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the negligence of the
Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of




                                       66
<PAGE>

such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the
use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks
or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect or
consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether
before or after the Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section 10.05
shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

         10.06 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid
by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate from time to time in effect.

         10.07 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, (iii) by way
of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of
subsection (f) or (i) of this Section, or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (h) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment
or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this
Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans




                                       67
<PAGE>

at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this
Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which
for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such
assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date"
is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not
be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise
consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part
of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; (iii) any assignment of a
Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent unless the Person that
is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed
assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder
shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

         (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a




                                       68
<PAGE>

portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a
Lender.

         (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 10.15 as though
it were a Lender.

         (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note,
if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment
to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

                  "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a
         Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a
         natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, and (ii)
         unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
         (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
         provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall
         not include the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or
         Subsidiaries.

                  "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
         (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business.



                                       69
<PAGE>

                  "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed
         by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an
         Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

         (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an "SPC") the option to provide all or
any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to
make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall
constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects
not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such
Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the
terms hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any
SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or
expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall
be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement
for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all
purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification
of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.
The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that,
prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the
payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to
receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of
any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

         (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for
such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even
though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

         10.08 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including




                                       70
<PAGE>

accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder;
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or
prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative
transaction relating to obligations of the Borrower; (g) with the consent of the
Borrower; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower; or (i) to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or any other similar organization. In addition, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and
information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service
providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Borrowings.
For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received
from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the
case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information.

         10.09 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the Borrower to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by,
and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or
the account of the Borrower against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing,
irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall
have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although
such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency
different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any
such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.



                                       71
<PAGE>

         10.10 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if
it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining
whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative
Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal
as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

         10.11 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         10.12 INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

         10.13 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations
and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or Event of Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue
in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder
shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

         10.14 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

         10.15 TAX FORMS. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States
person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign
Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any
payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment
of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form
W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling
it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be
made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS
Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to
such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other
evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such
Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code.
Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly
submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed
copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be
available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or
such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of
any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in
respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any
change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially
disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be
reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

         (ii) Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to
act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable
to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a
typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with
respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times
as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the
reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of
the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth
above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to
which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S.
withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or
any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to
transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption
required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own
account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.

         (iii) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount
to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any Taxes required
to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or
statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant
to this Section 10.15(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this Section 10.15(a); provided that if such Lender
shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 10.15(a) on the date such
Lender became a Lender or



                                       73
<PAGE>

ceased to act for its own account with respect to any payment under any of the
Loan Documents, nothing in this Section 10.15(a) shall relieve the Borrower of
its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as
a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation, administration or
application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver
forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact
that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such Lender receives
any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding
or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

         (iv) The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the
Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrower is not required to pay
additional amounts under this Section 10.15(a).

         (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a
"United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of
IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

         (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent
did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or
other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender
shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefore, including all penalties and
interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under
this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the
Administrative Agent.

         10.16 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. Under any circumstances set forth herein
providing that the Borrower shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party
to this Agreement, the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its
Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance)
pursuant to Section 10.07(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible Assignees
procured by the Borrower; provided, however, that if the Borrower elects to
exercise such right with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section 3.06(b) or
Section 3.06(c), it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made
similar requests for compensation pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, or made
similar determinations of illegality pursuant to Section 3.02 and failed to cure
such illegality by designating a different Lending Office. The Borrower shall
(x) pay in full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such
Lender through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant
to Section 3.05), and (y) release such Lender from its obligations under the
Loan Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender's Commitment and
outstanding Loans.

         10.17 GOVERNING LAW.

         (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, the LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within such State; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND
EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

         (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
