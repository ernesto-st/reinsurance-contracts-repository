Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (a) references to organizational  documents, agreements (including the Credit Documents) and other Contractual Requirements  shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, restatements, amendment and  restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications thereto, but only to the extent that  such amendments, restatements, amendment and restatements, extensions, supplements and other  modifications are permitted or not prohibited by any Credit Document and (b) references to any  Applicable Law shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending,  replacing, supplementing or interpreting such Applicable Law.  1.6 Times of Day  Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references  to New York City time (daylight or standard, as applicable).  1.7 Timing of Payment or Performance  When the payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or  obligation is stated to be due or performance required on a day which is not a Business Day, the  date of such payment (other than as described in the definition of Interest Period) or performance  shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business Day.  1.8 Currency Equivalents Generally  In determining whether any Indebtedness, Investment, Lien, Disposition, Restricted  Payment or any other amount under a &#8220;fixed amount&#8221; basket denominated in Dollars may be  incurred in a currency other than Dollars, such amount shall be determined based on the currency  exchange rate determined at the time of such incurrence (or, in the case of any revolving  Indebtedness or any amount committed to be made, at the time it is first committed); provided that  no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in  rates of exchange occurring after the time such Indebtedness, Investment, Lien, Disposition,  Restricted Payment or such other amount is incurred or made; provided, further that for purpose  of determining Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Debt or any  other amount or ratio determined based on Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA or  Consolidated Total Debt, amounts in currencies other than Dollars shall be translated into Dollars  at the currency exchange rates used in preparing the most recently delivered Section 9.1 Financials.  1.9 Classification of Loans and Borrowings  For purposes of this Agreement, Term Loans may be classified and referred to by  Class (e.g., an &#8220;Initial Term Loan&#8221;) or by Type (e.g., a &#8220;SOFR Loan&#8221;) or by Class and Type (e.g.,  a &#8220;SOFR Initial Term Loan&#8221;).  Borrowings also may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g.,  an &#8220;Initial Term Loan Borrowing&#8221;) or by Type (e.g., a &#8220;SOFR Borrowing&#8221;) or by Class and Type  (e.g., a &#8220;SOFR Initial Term Loan Borrowing&#8221;).    84  1.10 Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary  Any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred hereunder (including any Incremental  Facilities and Refinancing Facilities) may be incurred, at the option of the Borrower, by a newly  created and newly designated Unrestricted Subsidiary (an &#8220;Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary&#8221;)  with no assets other than the cash proceeds of such incurred Indebtedness plus, subject to  compliance with Section 10.5, any cash and Cash Equivalents contributed to such Unrestricted  Escrow Subsidiary as deposit of interest expenses and fees, additional cash collateral or for other  purposes, which Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary will then merge with and into the Borrower or  any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary surviving the  merger and assuming all obligations of the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary.  So long as such  Indebtedness would have been permitted to be incurred directly by the Borrower or any Restricted  Subsidiary upon the incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary, or,  with respect to any Indebtedness incurred in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, at  the option of the Borrower, at the time the LCT Election is made, the creation, designation and re- designation of the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary and the merger of the Unrestricted Escrow  Subsidiary into the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be subject to any additional  condition, including any condition that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing at such time.  1.11 Limited Condition Transactions  In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition  Transaction, for purposes of (i) determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement  which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test or (ii) testing availability under baskets  set forth in this Agreement (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA  or Consolidated Total Assets), in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower&#8217;s election  to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an &#8220;LCT  Election&#8221;; provided that such election may be revoked by the Borrower at any time prior to the  consummation or abandonment of the Limited Condition Transaction in question), the date of  determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder shall be deemed to be the date  the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (the &#8220;LCT Test  Date&#8221;), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction, the Borrower  or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such action on the relevant  LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket, such ratio, test or basket shall be  deemed to have been complied with.  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has made an  LCT Election and, following the LCT Test Date, any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which  compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would have failed to have been  satisfied as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in  Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense or Consolidated Total Assets following the  LCT Test Date but at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transaction,  such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have been satisfied as a result of  such fluctuations.  If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition  Transaction, then in connection with any event or transaction occurring after the relevant LCT Test  Date and prior to the earliest of the date on which (i) such Limited Condition Transaction is  consummated, (ii) the LCT Election is revoked by the Borrower and (iii) the date that the definitive  agreement or date for redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment    85  specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or  passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction (a  &#8220;Subsequent Transaction&#8221;) in connection with which a ratio, test or basket availability  calculation must be made on a Pro Forma Basis or giving Pro Forma Effect to such Subsequent  Transaction, for purposes of determining whether such ratio, test or basket availability has been  complied with under this Agreement, any such ratio, test or basket shall be required to be satisfied  on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in  connection therewith have been consummated.  1.12 Rates  The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept responsibility for, and shall  not have any liability with respect to (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of,  calculation of or any other matter related to ABR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term  SOFR or Term SOFR, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition  thereof, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark  Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, including whether the composition or  characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark  Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have  the same volume or liquidity as, ABR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR,  Term SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, or (b) the effect,  implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes.  The Administrative Agent and its  Related Parties may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of ABR, the Term SOFR  Reference Rate, Term SOFR, Adjusted Term SOFR, any alternative, successor or replacement rate  (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a  manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may select information sources or  services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain ABR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term  SOFR, Adjusted Term SOFR or any other Benchmark, in each case pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for  damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential  damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in  equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such  information source or service.

The Initial Term Loans shall be treated as a single Class of Term Loans for all  purposes of this Agreement and any other Credit Documents.  The Initial Term Loan prepaid or  repaid may not be re-borrowed.  For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding that, other than  pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above, no cash is exchanged, the Borrower shall owe the principal  amount of the Initial Term Loans to the Lenders under, and in accordance with the terms of, this  Agreement.  2.2 Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing; Maximum Number of Borrowings  The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing of Term Loans shall be in a  minimum amount of at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount for such Type of Term Loans and  in a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions  of Term Loans from one Type to the other Type, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same  Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect unless otherwise agreed  between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  2.3 Notice of Borrowing; Determination of Class of Term Loans  (a) Each Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower&#8217;s irrevocable Notice of  Borrowing to the Administrative Agent.

Each notice  by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) must be made in the form of a written Notice of  Borrowing, appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower.  Each  Notice of Borrowing shall specify (1) that the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, (2) the  requested date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (3) the principal amount of Term  Loans to be borrowed, (4) the Type of Term Loans to be borrowed and (5) if applicable, the  duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Term  Loan in a Notice of Borrowing, then the applicable Term Loans shall be made as ABR Loans.  If  the Borrower requests a Borrowing of SOFR Loans in any such Notice of Borrowing, but fails to  specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.  (b) Following receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall  promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its pro rata share of the Term Loans.  In the case of  each Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Term Loan available to the  Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in  Dollars not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Notice of  Borrowing.  Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 6, the  Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as  received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the  books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such  funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the  Administrative Agent by the Borrower.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the  Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for SOFR Loans upon determination  of such interest rate.  The determination of the Adjusted Term SOFR by the Administrative Agent  shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  At any time that ABR Loans are outstanding,  the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the prime  rate used in determining the ABR promptly following the public announcement of such change.  2.4 Disbursement of Funds  (a) No later than 12:00 p.m. on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing,  each Lender will make available its pro rata portion, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be  made on such date in the manner provided below; provided that on the Closing Date, such funds  may be made available at such earlier time as may be agreed among the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders for the purpose of consummating the Transactions.  (b) Each Lender shall make available all amounts required under any  Borrowing for its applicable Commitments in immediately available funds to the Administrative  Agent at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in Dollars, and the Administrative Agent will make  available to the Borrower, by depositing to an account designated by the Borrower to the  Administrative Agent the aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars.  Unless the    88  Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to the date of any  such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent  its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent  may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on  such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in  its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a  corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the  Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available such  amount to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding  amount from such Lender.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon  the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the  Borrower in writing and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the  Administrative Agent in Dollars.  The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from  such Lender or the Borrower interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from  the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the  Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a  rate per annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the Overnight Rate or (ii) if paid by the  Borrower, the then-applicable rate of interest or fees, calculated in accordance with Section 2.8,  for the Term Loans of the applicable Class.  (c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its  obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may  have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood,  however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its  commitments hereunder).  2.5 Repayment of Term Loans; Evidence of Debt  (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the  Lenders holding Initial Term Loans, on the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date, the then outstanding  Initial Term Loans.  The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the  applicable Lenders, on the other applicable Maturity Dates, the then outstanding other Term Loans.  (b) The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars, for the  benefit of the Lenders of the Initial Term Loans, on the last Business Day of each March, June,  September and December commencing on December 29, 2023 (each such Business Day, an  &#8220;Initial Term Loan Repayment Date&#8221;), an aggregate principal amount equal to 0.25% of the  aggregate principal amount of all Initial Term Loans outstanding on the Closing Date (each such  repayment amount, an &#8220;Initial Term Loan Repayment Amount&#8221;), which payments shall be  reduced as a result of voluntary prepayments or repurchase of the Initial Term Loans in accordance  with this Agreement, including Sections 5.1 and 13.6(g) and further reduced by any prepayments  pursuant to Section 5.2 and any other reductions in principal of the Initial Term Loans, including  pursuant to Section 2.15, 2.16 or 13.7.  (c) In the event that any Incremental Term Loans are made, such Incremental  Term Loans shall be repaid by the Borrower in the amounts (each, an &#8220;Incremental Term Loan  Repayment Amount&#8221;) and on the dates as agreed between the Borrower and the relevant Lenders    89  of such Incremental Term Loans, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 2.14.  In the event  that any Extended Term Loans are made, such Extended Term Loans shall, subject to Section  2.15(a), be repaid by the Borrower in the amounts (each, an &#8220;Extended Term Loan Repayment  Amount&#8221;) and on the dates set forth in the applicable Extension Amendment.  In the event that  any Refinancing Term Loans are established, such Refinancing Term Loans shall, subject to  Section 2.15(b), be repaid by the Borrower in the amounts (each, a &#8220;Refinancing Term Loan  Repayment Amount&#8221;) and on the dates set forth in the applicable Refinancing Amendment.  (d) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account  or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the appropriate lending office of such  Lender resulting from each Term Loan made by such lending office of such Lender from time to  time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lending office of  such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.  (e) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section  13.6(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together)  shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Term Loan made hereunder and, if applicable, the relevant  tranche thereof and the Type of each Term Loan made and the Interest Period applicable thereto,  (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the  Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative  Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender&#8217;s share thereof, and (iv) any cancellation or  retirement of Term Loans as contemplated by Section 13.6(g).  (f) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts maintained  pursuant to clauses (d) and (e) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,  be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein  recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to  maintain such accounts, such Register or such subaccounts, as applicable, or any error therein,  shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest)  the Term Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any inconsistency between the Register  and subaccounts maintained by the Administrative Agent and any Lender&#8217;s records under clause  (d) of this Section, the recordations in the Register and such subaccounts shall govern.  (g) The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon request of any Lender at any time  and from time to time after the Borrower has made an initial Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower  shall provide to such Lender, at the Borrower&#8217;s expense a promissory note substantially in the  form of Exhibit B, evidencing the Term Loans owing to such Lender.  (h) The Initial Term Loans shall mature and become due and payable on the  Initial Term Loan Maturity Date.  2.6 Conversions and Continuations  (a) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this clause (a), (x) the Borrower shall  have the option on any Business Day to convert all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum  Borrowing Amount (or a whole multiple of, in the case of SOFR Loans, $500,000 in excess    90  thereof, or in the case of ABR Loans, $100,000 in excess thereof) of the outstanding principal  amount of any Term Loans of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type and  (y) the Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to continue the outstanding principal  amount of any SOFR Loans as SOFR Loans, for an additional Interest Period; provided that (i) no  partial conversion of SOFR Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of SOFR Loans  made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount, (ii) ABR  Loans may not be converted into SOFR Loans if an Event of Default is in existence on the date of  the conversion and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its  or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion, (iii) SOFR Loans may not be continued as  SOFR Loans for an additional Interest Period if an Event of Default is in existence on the date of  the proposed continuation and the Required Lenders have determined in their sole discretion not  to permit such continuation, and (iv) Borrowings resulting from conversions pursuant to this  Section 2.6 shall be limited in number as provided in Section 2.2.  Each such conversion or  continuation shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office prior to 1:00 p.m. at least (i) one (1) Business Day&#8217;s in the case of  a conversion into ABR Loans or (ii) three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days&#8217;, in the  case of a continuation of, or conversion to, SOFR Loans, prior written notice, in each case  substantially in the form of Exhibit A (each, a &#8220;Notice of Conversion or Continuation&#8221;)  specifying (1) whether the Borrower is requesting a conversion of Term Loans from one Type to  the other or a continuation of SOFR Loans, (2) the requested date of such conversion or  continuation, as applicable (which shall be a Business Day), (3) the principal amount of the Term  Loans to be so converted or continued, (4) the Type of Term Loans to be converted into or  continued and (5) if such Term Loans are to be converted into, or continued as, SOFR Loans, the  Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto (if no Interest Period is selected, the Borrower shall  be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month&#8217;s duration).  The Administrative Agent  shall give each applicable Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed  conversion or continuation affecting any of its Term Loans.  (b) If any Event of Default is in existence at the time of any proposed  continuation of any SOFR Loans and the Required Lenders have determined in their sole discretion  not to permit such continuation, such SOFR Loans shall be automatically converted on the last day  of the current Interest Period into ABR Loans.  If the Borrower has failed to deliver a timely Notice  of Conversion or Continuation to continue any SOFR Loans as provided in clause (a) above, the  Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing of SOFR Loans into a  Borrowing of ABR Loans, effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.  If no  timely Notice of Conversion or Continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative  Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to ABR Loans.  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Borrower may deliver  a Notice of Conversion or Continuation pursuant to which the Borrower elects to irrevocably  continue the outstanding principal amount of any Term Loans subject to an interest rate Hedging  Agreement as SOFR Loans for each Interest Period until the expiration of the term of such  applicable Hedging Agreement.  2.7 Benchmark Replacement Setting for Term Loans  With respect to the Term Loans:  </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein  or in any other Credit Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the  Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current  Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement.  Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark  Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th)  Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected  Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time,  written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.   No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.7(a)(i)  will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.  (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.  In connection with the use,  administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative  Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing  such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other  party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document.  (c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations.  The Administrative  Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any  Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with  the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement.  The  Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (x) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of  a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.7(d) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark  Unavailability Period.  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the  Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section  2.7, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or  non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking  any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made  in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any  other Credit Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.7.  (d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark.  Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, at any time (including in connection with the  implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate  (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not  displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as  selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor  for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of  information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative,  then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or  analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable  or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either  (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a  Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not  or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the  Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous    92  definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed  tenor.  (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period.  Upon the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice  of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any  pending request for a SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be  made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the  Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or  conversion to ABR Loans.  During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor  for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the  then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any  determination of ABR.  2.8 Interest  (a) (i) The unpaid principal amount of each ABR Loan shall bear interest from  the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate  per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable ABR Margin plus the ABR, in each case, in  effect from time to time; and (ii) the unpaid principal amount of each SOFR Loan shall bear interest  from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or  otherwise) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable SOFR Margin plus the  relevant Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case in effect from time to time.  With respect to each  interest payment date with respect to the Initial Term Loans from the Closing Date through and  including June 30, 2024, the Borrower shall, by delivering a Cash/PIK Election Notice to the  Administrative Agent on or prior to five (5) Business Days prior to each interest payment date  (the &#8220;Cash Election Date&#8221;), elect whether interest payments due on such upcoming interest  payment date shall be paid in cash (the &#8220;Cash Option&#8221;) or paid partially in cash and paid partially  in kind and capitalized by adding the amount specified in the definition of Applicable ABR Margin  or Applicable SOFR Margin, as applicable, to the outstanding principal amount of such Term  Loans (the &#8220;Cash/PIK Option&#8221;); provided that if the Borrower fails to deliver a Cash/PIK  Election Notice by the Cash Election Date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected the  Cash/PIK Option for the applicable interest payment date.  Any capitalized amounts shall  thereafter bear interest in accordance with this Section.  For the avoidance of doubt, interest on the  Initial Term Loans for each interest payment date following June 30, 2024 shall be payable in cash.  (b) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Term Loan or (ii) any  interest payable thereon or any other amount hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the  Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), and a Specified Default shall have occurred and be  continuing, then, upon the giving of written notice by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower  (except in the case of an Event of Default under Section 11.5, for which no notice is required),  such overdue amount (other than any such amount owed to a Defaulting Lender) shall bear interest  at a rate (the &#8220;Default Rate&#8221;) that is (x) in the case of overdue principal and overdue interest on  such principal, the rate that would otherwise be applicable to such principal as if the Borrower had  elected the Cash Option plus 2% per annum or (y) in the case of any other amounts due hereunder,  to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the rate described in Section 2.8(a) for ABR Loans as  if the Borrower had elected the Cash Option plus 2% per annum from the date of such written  notice to the date on which such amount is paid in full (after as well as before judgment) (or if an    93  Event of Default under Section 11.5 shall have occurred and be continuing, from the date of the  occurrence of such Event of Default).  (c) Interest on each Term Loan shall accrue from and including the date of any  Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable in Dollars;  provided that any Term Loan that is repaid on the same date on which it is made shall bear interest  for one day.  Except as provided below, interest shall be payable (i) in respect of each ABR Loan,  quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, (ii)  in respect of each SOFR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the  case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each Business Day occurring at three- month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and (iii) in respect of each Term Loan,  (A) on any prepayment; provided that interest on ABR Loans shall only become due pursuant to  this clause (A) if the aggregate principal amount of the ABR Loans then-outstanding is repaid in  full, (B) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (C) after such maturity, on demand.  (d) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with  Section 5.5.  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if at  the end of any accrual period (as defined in Section 1272(a)(5) of the Code) ending after the fifth  (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid original issue  discount and interest (as determined pursuant to the Code) which would be includible in gross  income with respect to such Term Loan for periods before the close of any accrual period (as  defined in Section 1272(a)(5) of the Code) ending after the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date on  which such Term Loan was issued exceeds the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of interest to be  paid under the Term Loan before the close of such accrual period and (ii) the product of (x) the  issue price (as defined in Sections 1273(b) and 1274(a) of the Code and the regulations  promulgated thereunder) and (y) the yield to maturity (interpreted in accordance with Section  163(i) of the Code (the &#8220;Maximum Amount&#8221;)), then interest for such accrual period shall not be  deferred and all accrued but unpaid interest and original issue discount (as determined pursuant to  the Code) as of the end of such accrual period shall be paid in an amount (which amount, if any,  shall, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, be calculated and determined  by the Borrower) not less than the amount required to reduce the accrued but unpaid original issue  discount at the end of such period to an amount less than the Maximum Amount (the &#8220;AHYDO  Interest Payment&#8221;).  No partial prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to any other provision of  this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall alter the obligation of the Borrower to make  payments provided for in this Section.  For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything  to the contrary herein, this Section shall be construed so as to require payments to be made in cash  and at such times and in such amounts (which amounts, if any, shall be calculated and determined  by the Borrower) so as to cause the Term Loans to not be treated as having &#8220;significant original  issue discount&#8221; within the meaning of Section 163(i)(2) pursuant to the Code.  If an AHYDO  Interest Payment is required, the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent prior written  notice of the amount and date of payment of such AHYDO Interest Payment, not later than 12:00  p.m., five (5) Business Days in advance thereof.    94  2.9 Interest Periods  At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or  Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion into or continuation as, a Borrowing of  SOFR Loans in accordance with Section 2.6(a), the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent  written notice of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at  the option of the Borrower, be one, three or six months; provided that the Interest Period may be  a period of less than one month that is agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, so  long as for purposes of determining Term SOFR, Term SOFR in respect of such period shall be  based on Term SOFR in respect of a one-month tenor.  Notwithstanding foregoing, the initial  Interest Period of the Initial Term Loans shall be from the Closing Date to June 30, 2023, and  Term SOFR in respect of such Interest Period shall be based on Term SOFR in respect of a three- month tenor.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:  (a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of SOFR Loans shall  commence on the date of such Borrowing (or the date of any conversion from a Borrowing of ABR  Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence  on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;  (b) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of SOFR Loans begins on the  last Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for which there is no numerically  corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period  shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;  (c) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business  Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided that if any  Interest Period in respect of a SOFR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business  Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such  Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and  (d) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period in respect of  (i) any SOFR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the applicable Maturity Date of  such Term Loan or (ii) the Initial Term Loans such that there would be more than one Interest  Period beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the Initial Term Loan  Maturity Date.  In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the Administrative  Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing  such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other  party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document.  The Administrative Agent will promptly  notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in  connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR.  </FONT></DIV>

(a) [Reserved.]  (b) [Reserved.]  (c) If, after the Closing Date, any Change in Law relating to capital adequacy  or liquidity of any Lender or compliance by any Lender or its parent with any Change in Law  relating to capital adequacy or liquidity occurring after the Closing Date, has or would have the  effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#8217;s or its parent&#8217;s or its Affiliates&#8217; capital or  assets as a consequence of such Lender&#8217;s commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below  that which such Lender or its parent or any Affiliate thereof could have achieved but for such  Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s or parent&#8217;s policies with respect to capital  adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time, promptly after written demand by such Lender  (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction, it being  understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation as a  result of such Lender&#8217;s compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with,  any Applicable Law as in effect on the Closing Date.  Each Lender, upon determining in good  faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), will give prompt  written notice thereof to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which notice  shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although  the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 2.13, release or diminish the  Borrower&#8217;s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of  such notice.  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall demand compensation  pursuant to this Section 2.10 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such  Lender to demand such compensation in substantially the same manner as applied to other  similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities.  (e) [Reserved.]  (f) Subject to Section 2.7, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period  for any SOFR Loan:  (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be  conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that &#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221; cannot be  determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or  (ii) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection  with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that  Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR  Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and  maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided written notice of such  determination to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will promptly so  notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to  the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the    96  Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be  suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the  Administrative Agent (at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.   Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a  borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected  SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to  have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR  Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will  be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest  Period.  Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the  amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section  2.11.  Subject to Section 2.7, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination  shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that &#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221; cannot  be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on ABR  Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c)(x)  of the definition of &#8220;ABR&#8221; until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.  2.11 Compensation  If (i) any payment of principal of any SOFR Loan is made by the Borrower to or  for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such SOFR Loan  as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 13.7, as a result  of acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason,  (ii) any Borrowing of SOFR Loans is not made as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Borrowing,  (iii) any ABR Loan is not converted into a SOFR Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of  Conversion or Continuation, (iv) any SOFR Loan is not continued as a SOFR Loan as a result of  a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (v) any prepayment of principal of any  SOFR Loan is not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1  or 5.2, the Borrower shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender (which request shall  set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) (with a copy to the  Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any  amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such  Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or  failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually  incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any  Lender to fund or maintain such SOFR Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall  demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11 if it shall not at the time be the general policy  or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in substantially the same manner as  applied to other similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities.  2.12 Change of Lending Office  Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the  operation of Section 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use  reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another  lending office for any Term Loans affected by such event; provided that such designation is made  on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory    97  disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation  of any such Section.  Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations  of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 5.4.  The Borrower hereby agrees  to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with such  designation.  2.13 Notice of Certain Costs  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice  required by Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 180 days after such Lender  has knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the  additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in such  Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4, as the  case may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 181st day prior to the giving  of such notice to the Borrower.  2.14 Incremental Facilities  (a) The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, elect to request the  establishment of (x) one or more additional tranches of term loans, which may be of the same Class  as any then-existing Term Loans (a &#8220;Term Loan Increase&#8221;) or a separate Class of Term Loans  (the commitments for additional term loans of the same Class or a separate Class, collectively, the  &#8220;Incremental Term Commitments&#8221;) or (y) one or more tranches of revolving credit facilities  (the &#8220;Incremental Revolving Commitments&#8221;, together with the Incremental Term  Commitments, the &#8220;Incremental Commitments&#8221;; and the loans thereunder, &#8220;Incremental  Loans&#8221;), in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of the then-available Maximum  Incremental Facilities Amount at the time of incurrence thereof and not less than $10,000,000  individually (or such lesser amount as (x) may be approved by the Administrative Agent in its  reasonable discretion or (y) shall constitute the then-available Maximum Incremental Facilities  Amount at such time).  The Borrower may approach any existing Lender or any Additional Lender  to provide all or a portion of the Incremental Commitments; provided that any Lender offered or  approached to provide all or a portion of the Incremental Commitments may elect or decline, in its  sole discretion, to provide an Incremental Commitment, and the Borrower shall have no obligation  to approach any existing Lender to provide any Incremental Commitment; provided, further, that  the Administrative Agent shall have consented to such Additional Lender&#8217;s providing of the  Incremental Commitments to the extent such consent, if any, would be required under Section  13.6(b) in connection with an assignment of Term Loans or Commitments to such Additional  Lender.  In each case, such Incremental Commitments shall become effective as of the date  determined by the Borrower (the &#8220;Increased Amount Date&#8221;); provided that, (i) (x) other than as  described in the immediately succeeding clause (y), no Event of Default shall exist on such  Increased Amount Date immediately before or immediately after giving effect to such Incremental  Commitments and the borrowing of any Incremental Loans thereunder or (y) if such Incremental  Commitment is being provided in connection with a Permitted Acquisition or similar Investment,  or in connection with refinancing of any Indebtedness that requires an irrevocable prepayment or  redemption notice, then no Specified Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date, (ii) in  connection with any incurrence of Incremental Loans or establishment of Incremental  Commitments, there shall be no requirement for the Borrower to bring down the representations    98  and warranties under the Credit Documents unless requested by the lenders providing such  Incremental Loans or Incremental Commitments (subject to waiver by such lenders of any such  requirement) and (iii) the establishment of Incremental Commitments or the incurrence of  Incremental Loans shall be effected pursuant to one or more amendments (each, an &#8220;Incremental  Amendment&#8221;) to this Agreement executed and delivered by the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent, and each of which shall be recorded in the Register and shall be subject to the requirements  set forth in Section 5.4(e).  For all purposes of this Agreement, any Incremental Term Loans made  on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated (x) a separate series of Term Loans or (y) in the  case of a Term Loan Increase, a part of the series of existing Term Loans subject to such increase  (such new or existing series of Term Loans, each, a &#8220;Series&#8221;).  (b) The terms and conditions of the Incremental Revolving Commitments shall  be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided that (i) such Incremental  Revolving Commitments may have a maturity that is shorter than the Maturity Dates of the Term  Loans but such maturity shall be longer than the Initial ABL Facility Maturity Date, (ii) the pricing,  interest rate margins, discounts, premiums, interest rate floors and fees of such Incremental  Revolving Commitments shall be determined by the Borrower and the lender(s) thereunder and  shall not be subject to any &#8220;most-favored nation&#8221; provisions (including under Section 2.14(d)(iv)  below), (iii) such Incremental Revolving Commitments may have sub-facilities for letters of credit  and swingline loans, (iv) lenders providing such Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be  included in the definition of &#8220;Required Lenders&#8221;, (v) if such Incremental Revolving Commitments  benefit from a financial covenant, the Term Loans shall not be required to enjoy the same benefit  of such financial covenant and they shall cross accelerate (instead of cross default) to a breach of  such financial covenant, (vi) customary amendments to the definition of &#8220;Maximum Incremental  Facilities Amount&#8221; may be made to permit any repayment of loans under Incremental Revolving  Commitments accompanied with permanent terminations of such Incremental Revolving  Commitments to be added to clause (2) of such definition, (vii) no Subsidiary (other than a  Guarantor) is an obligor of such Incremental Revolving Commitments and (viii) if secured, such  Incremental Revolving Commitments are not secured by any assets other than all or any portion  of the Collateral or any Liens other than Liens that are pari passu with or junior to the Liens  securing the Obligations.  (c) On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Term  Commitments of any Series are effective, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the foregoing  applicable terms and conditions, (i) each Lender with an Incremental Term Commitment of any  Series shall make a term loan to the Borrower (an &#8220;Incremental Term Loan&#8221;) in an amount equal  to its Incremental Term Commitment of such Series, and (ii) each Lender of any Series shall  become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Term Commitment of such Series and  the Incremental Term Loans of such Series made pursuant thereto.  The Borrower shall use the  proceeds, if any, of the Incremental Term Loans for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement  and as agreed by the Borrower and the lender(s) providing such Incremental Term Loans.  (d) The terms and provisions of any Incremental Term Commitments and the  respective related Incremental Term Loans, in each case effected pursuant to a Term Loan Increase  shall be substantially identical to the terms and provisions applicable to the Class of Term Loans  subject to such increase; provided that underwriting, arrangement, structuring, ticking,  commitment, original issue discount, upfront or similar fees, and other fees payable in connection  </FONT></DIV>

The terms and provisions  of any Incremental Term Commitments and the respective related Incremental Term Loans of any  Series not effected pursuant to a Term Loan Increase shall be on terms and documentation set forth  in the applicable Incremental Amendment as determined by the Borrower; provided that:  (i) the applicable Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date of each Series  shall be no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date with respect to the Initial Term Loans,  provided that the requirements of the foregoing clause (i) shall not apply to any customary  bridge facility so long as the Indebtedness into which such customary bridge facility is to  be converted complies with such requirements;  (ii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the applicable  Incremental Term Loans of each Series shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life  to Maturity of the Initial Term Loans;  (iii) the Incremental Term Loans (x) may participate on a pro rata basis,  greater than pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis in any voluntary prepayment of any  Class of Term Loans hereunder and may participate on a pro rata basis or less than pro  rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any mandatory prepayments of any  Class of Term Loans hereunder; provided that if such Incremental Term Loans are  unsecured or rank junior in right of payment or as to security with the Obligations, such  Incremental Term Loans shall participate on a junior basis with respect to mandatory  repayments of Term Loans hereunder (except in connection with any refinancing,  extension, renewal, replacement, repurchase or retirement thereof permitted by this  Agreement), (y) shall not be guaranteed or incurred by any Subsidiary other than a Credit  Party hereunder and (z) shall be unsecured or rank pari passu or junior in right of security  with any Obligations outstanding under this Agreement and, if secured, shall not be secured  by any assets other than Collateral (and, unless secured on a pari passu basis with the  Obligations, shall be subject to a subordination agreement (if payment subordinated) and/or  the Applicable Intercreditor Agreement);  (iv) the pricing, interest rate margins, discounts, premiums, interest rate  floors, fees, and amortization schedule (subject to clauses (i) and (ii) above) applicable to  any Incremental Term Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the lender(s)  thereunder; provided, however, that, if the Yield, in respect of any Incremental Term Loans  that (w) rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the Initial Term Loans, (x)  are incurred on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and  (y) have a maturity date that is less than ninety (90) days after the Initial Term Loan  Maturity Date as of the date of funding thereof, exceeds the Yield in respect of any Initial  Term Loans by more than 0.50%, then the Applicable ABR Margin or the Applicable  SOFR Margin, as applicable, in respect of such Initial Term Loans shall be adjusted so that  the Yield in respect of such Initial Term Loans is equal to the Yield in respect of such  Incremental Term Loans minus 0.50%; provided, further, to the extent any change in the  Yield of the Initial Term Loans is necessitated by this clause (iv) on the basis of an effective    100  interest rate floor in respect of the Incremental Term Loans, the increased Yield in the  Initial Term Loans shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Borrower) have such  increase in the Yield effected solely by increases in the interest rate floor(s) applicable to  the Initial Term Loans; and  (v) all other terms of any Incremental Term Loans (other than as  described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above) may differ from the terms of the Initial  Term Loans if agreed by the Borrower and the lender(s) providing such Incremental Term  Loans.

Each  Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, (x) effect technical and  corresponding amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as may be  necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower,  to effect the provisions of this Section 2.14 and (y) with respect to the Incremental Revolving  Commitments, add provisions solely applicable to such Incremental Revolving Commitments  (including provisions relating to extensions and refinancings of Incremental Revolving  Commitments).  At the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall deliver a certificate  of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower, certifying that the conditions and requirements with  respect to such Incremental Commitments and/or Incremental Loans set forth in this Section 2.14  have been met and such Incremental Amendment is authorized under this Section 2.14 (upon  which the Administrative Agent may conclusively rely without further investigation or inquiry).  2.15 Extensions of Term Loans; Refinancing Facilities  (a) Extensions  (i) The Borrower may at any time and from time to time request that all  or a portion of the Term Loans of any Class (an &#8220;Existing Term Loan Class&#8221;) be  converted to extend the scheduled maturity date(s) of any payment of principal with respect  to all or a portion of any principal amount of such Term Loans (any such Term Loans  which have been so converted, &#8220;Extended Term Loans&#8221;) and to provide for other terms  consistent with this Section 2.15.  In order to establish any Extended Term Loans, the  Borrower shall provide a written notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a  copy of such notice to each of the Lenders of the applicable Existing Term Loan Class  which such request shall be offered equally to all such Lenders) (a &#8220;Term Loan Extension  Request&#8221;) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Loans to be established,  which shall either, at the option of the Borrower, (A) reflect market terms and conditions  (taken as a whole) at the time of incurrence or issuance (as determined in good faith by the  Borrower) or (B) if not consistent with the terms of the applicable Existing Term Loan  Class, shall not be materially more restrictive to the Credit Parties (as determined in good  faith by the Borrower), when taken as a whole, than the terms of the Term Loans of the  Existing Term Loan Class unless (x) the Lenders of the Term Loans of such applicable    101  Existing Term Loan Class receive the benefit of such more restrictive terms or (y) any such  provisions apply after the Latest Maturity Date as determined at the time of incurrence or  issuance; provided, however, that (1) the scheduled final maturity date shall be extended  and all or any of the scheduled amortization payments of principal of the Extended Term  Loans may be delayed to later dates than the scheduled amortization of principal of the  Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Class (with any such delay resulting in a  corresponding adjustment to the scheduled amortization payments reflected in Section 2.5  or in the Extension Amendment, as the case may be, with respect to the Existing Term  Loan Class from which such Extended Term Loans were converted, in each case as more  particularly set forth in Section 2.15(a)(iii)), (2)(A) pricing, fees, optional prepayment or  redemption terms shall be determined in good faith by the Borrower and the interest rates,  interest margins, upfront fees, funding discounts, original issue discounts and premiums  (including through fixed rate interest) with respect to the Extended Term Loans may be  higher or lower than the interest margins and floors for the Term Loans of such Existing  Term Loan Class and/or (B) additional fees, premiums or AHYDO Catch-Up Payments  may be payable to the Lenders providing such Extended Term Loans in addition to or in  lieu of any of the items contemplated by the preceding clause (A), in each case, to the  extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment, (3) the Extended Term Loans  may participate on a pro rata basis, greater than pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis  in any voluntary prepayment of any Class of Term Loans hereunder and may participate  on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in  any mandatory prepayments of any Class of Term Loans hereunder; provided that if such  Extended Term Loans are unsecured or rank junior in right of payment or as to security  with the Obligations, such Extended Term Loans shall participate on a junior basis with  respect to mandatory repayments of Term Loans hereunder (except in connection with any  refinancing, extension, renewal, replacement, repurchase or retirement thereof permitted  by this Agreement) and (4) Extended Term Loans may have call protection and prepayment  premiums and, subject to clause (3) above, other redemption terms as may be agreed by  the Borrower and the Lenders thereof; provided that the principal amount of the Extended  Term Loans shall not exceed the principal amount of the Term Loans being extended  except as otherwise permitted herein; provided, further, that the Extended Term Loans  shall not be guaranteed or incurred by any Subsidiary other than a Credit Party hereunder  and, if secured, shall not be secured by any assets other than Collateral (and, unless secured  on a pari passu basis with the Obligations, shall be subject to a subordination agreement  (if payment subordinated) and/or the Applicable Intercreditor Agreement (if secured)).  No  Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Term Loans of any Existing  Term Loan Class converted into Extended Term Loans pursuant to any Term Loan  Extension Request.  (ii) Any Lender (an &#8220;Extending Lender&#8221;) wishing to have all or a  portion of its Term Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class or Existing Term Loan Classes  subject to such Term Loan Extension Request converted into Extended Term Loans shall  notify the Administrative Agent in writing (an &#8220;Extension Election&#8221;) on or prior to the  date specified in such Term Loan Extension Request of the amount of its Term Loans of  the Existing Term Loan Class or Existing Term Loan Classes subject to such Term Loan  Extension Request that it has elected to convert into Extended Term Loans.  In the event  that the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class or    102  Existing Term Loan Classes subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of  Extended Term Loans requested pursuant to the Term Loan Extension Request, Term  Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class or Existing Term Loan Classes subject to Extension  Elections shall be converted to Extended Term Loans on a pro rata basis based on the  amount of Term Loans included in each such Extension Election (with such pro rata  calculation to be determined by the Borrower).  (iii) Extended Term Loans shall be established pursuant to an  amendment (an &#8220;Extension Amendment&#8221;) to this Agreement (which, except to the extent  expressly contemplated by the last sentence of this Section 2.15(a)(iii) and notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in Section 13.1, shall not require the consent of any  Lender other than the Extending Lenders with respect to the Extended Term Loans  established thereby) executed by the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the  Extending Lenders.  No Extension Amendment shall provide for any Class of Extended  Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount that is less than $10,000,000 and the  Borrower may condition the effectiveness of any Extension Amendment on an Extension  Minimum Condition, which may be waived by the Borrower in its sole discretion.  In  addition to any terms and changes required or permitted by Section 2.15(a), each Extension  Amendment shall amend the scheduled amortization payments pursuant to Section 2.5 or  the applicable Extension Amendment with respect to the Existing Term Loan Class from  which the Extended Term Loans were converted to reduce each scheduled Repayment  Amount for the Existing Term Loan Class in the same proportion as the amount of Term  Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class is to be converted pursuant to such Extension  Amendment (it being understood that the amount of any Repayment Amount payable with  respect to any individual Term Loan of such Existing Term Loan Class that is not an  Extended Term Loan shall not be reduced as a result thereof).  Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary in this Section 2.15, and without limiting the generality or applicability of  Section 13.1 to any Section 2.15(a) Additional Amendments, any Extension Amendment  may provide for additional terms and/or additional amendments other than those referred  to or contemplated above (any such additional amendment, a &#8220;Section 2.15(a) Additional  Amendment&#8221;) to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents; provided that such  Section 2.15(a) Additional Amendments comply with the requirements of Section 2.15(a)  and do not become effective prior to the time that such Section 2.15(a) Additional  Amendments have been consented to (including, without limitation, pursuant to (1)  consents applicable to holders of Incremental Term Loans provided for in any Incremental  Amendment and (2) consents applicable to holders of any Extended Term Loans provided  for in any Extension Amendment) by such of the Lenders, Credit Parties and other parties  (if any) as may be required in order for such Section 2.15(a) Additional Amendments to  become effective in accordance with Section 13.1.  At the request of the Administrative  Agent, the Borrower shall deliver a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower,  certifying that the conditions and requirements with respect to such Extended Term Loans  set forth in this Section 2.15(a) have been met and such Extension Amendment and/or  Section 2.15(a) Additional Amendment is authorized under this Section 2.15(a) (upon  which the Administrative Agent may conclusively rely without further investigation or  inquiry).  </FONT></DIV>

Any Extended Term Loans shall constitute a separate Class of  Term Loans from the Existing Term Loan Class from which they were converted; provided  that any Extended Term Loans converted from an Existing Term Loan Class may, to the  extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment, be designated as an increase in  any then outstanding Class of Term Loans other than the Existing Term Loan Class from  which such Extended Term Loans were converted (in which case scheduled amortization  with respect thereto shall be proportionally increased).  (v) The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.15(a) (including, for the  avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees, or premium in respect of any Extended  Term Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Amendment) and  hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including, without  limitation, any pro rata payment or amendment section) or any other Credit Document that  may otherwise prohibit or restrict any such extension or any other transaction contemplated  by this Section 2.15(a).  (vi) In the event that the Administrative Agent determines, and the  Borrower agrees (acting reasonably), that the allocation of Extended Term Loans of a given  Extension Series to a given Lender was incorrectly determined as a result of manifest  administrative error in the receipt and processing of an Extension Election timely submitted  by such Lender in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable Extension  Amendment, then the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and such affected Lender may  (and hereby are authorized to), in their sole discretion and without the consent of any other  Lender, enter into an amendment to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (each,  a &#8220;Corrective Extension Amendment&#8221;) within fifteen (15) days following the effective  date of such Extension Amendment, as the case may be, which Corrective Extension  Amendment shall (A) provide for the conversion and extension of the applicable Term  Loans in such amount as is required to cause such Lender to hold Extended Term Loans of  the applicable Extension Series into which such other Term Loans were initially converted,  as the case may be, in the amount such Lender would have held had such administrative  error not occurred and had such Lender received the minimum allocation of the applicable  Term Loans or Commitments to which it was entitled under the terms of such Extension  Amendment, in the absence of such error, (B) be subject to the satisfaction of such  conditions as the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and such Lender may agree  (including conditions of the type required to be satisfied for the effectiveness of an  Extension Amendment described in Section 2.15(a)), and (C) effect such other  amendments of the type (with appropriate reference and nomenclature changes) described  in Section 2.15(a) to the extent reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this  Section 2.15(a)(vi).    104  (vii) No conversion of Term Loans or Commitments pursuant to any  Extension Amendment in accordance with this Section 2.15(a) shall constitute a voluntary  or mandatory payment or prepayment for purposes of this Agreement.  (b) Refinancing Facilities.  (i) The Borrower may, at any time or from time to time after the  Closing Date, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (a &#8220;Refinancing Term Loan  Request&#8221;), request the establishment of (x) one or more new Classes of Term Loans under  this Agreement (any such new Class, &#8220;New Refinancing Commitments&#8221;) or (y) increases  to one or more existing Classes of Term Loans under this Agreement (any such increase to  an existing Class, collectively with New Refinancing Commitments, &#8220;Refinancing  Commitments&#8221;), in each case, established in exchange for, or to extend, renew, replace,  repurchase, retire or refinance, in whole or in part, as selected by the Borrower, any one or  more existing Class or Classes of Term Loans or Commitments (with respect to a particular  Refinancing Commitment or Refinancing Term Loan, such existing Term Loans or  Commitments, &#8220;Refinanced Debt&#8221;), whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly  deliver a copy of each such written notice to each of the Lenders.  (ii) Any Refinancing Term Loans made pursuant to New Refinancing  Commitments shall be designated a separate Class of Term Loans, for all purposes of this  Agreement unless designated as a part of an existing Class of Term Loans in accordance  with this Section 2.15(b).  On any Refinancing Facility Closing Date on which any  Refinancing Commitments of any Class are effected, subject to the satisfaction or waiver  of the terms and conditions in this Section 2.15(b), (x) each Refinancing Term Lender of  such Class shall make a term loan to the Borrower (each, a &#8220;Refinancing Term Loan&#8221;) in  an amount equal to its Refinancing Commitment of such Class and (y) each Refinancing  Term Lender of such Class shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the  Refinancing Commitment of such Class and the Refinancing Term Loans of such Class  made pursuant thereto.  (iii) Each Refinancing Term Loan Request from the Borrower pursuant  to this Section 2.15(b) shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the  relevant Refinancing Term Loans and identify the Refinanced Debt with respect thereto.   Refinancing Term Loans may be made by any existing Lender (but no existing Lender will  have an obligation to make any Refinancing Commitment, nor will the Borrower have any  obligation to approach any existing Lender to provide any Refinancing Commitment) or  by any Additional Lender (each such existing Lender or Additional Lender providing such  Commitment or Term Loan, a &#8220;Refinancing Term Lender&#8221;); provided that the  Administrative Agent shall have consented to such Additional Lender&#8217;s providing of the  Refinancing Commitments to the extent such consent, if any, would be required under  Section 13.6(b) in connection with an assignment of Term Loans or Commitments to such  Additional Lender.

(v) [Reserved].  (vi) The terms, provisions and documentation of the Refinancing Term  Loans and Refinancing Commitments of any Class shall be as agreed between the  Borrower and the applicable Refinancing Term Lenders providing such Refinancing  Commitments, and except as otherwise set forth herein, to the extent not identical to (or  constituting a part of) any Class of Term Loans existing on the Refinancing Facility  Closing Date, shall be consistent with the provisions below, and the other terms and  conditions shall either, at the option of the Borrower, (x) reflect market terms and  conditions (taken as a whole) at the time of incurrence or issuance (as determined by the  Borrower) or (y), not be materially more restrictive to the Borrower (as determined by the  Borrower), when taken as a whole, than the terms of the Initial Term Loans (except (1)  covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Maturity Date (as  of the applicable Refinancing Facility Closing Date) and (2) pricing, fees, rate floors,  premiums, optional prepayment or redemption terms (which shall be determined by the  Borrower) and it being understood there shall be no &#8220;MFN&#8221; protection unless the Lenders  under the Term Loans existing on the Refinancing Facility Closing Date, receive the  benefit of such more restrictive terms).  In any event, the Refinancing Term Loans:  (1) (I) shall rank pari passu or junior in right of payment  with any Obligations outstanding under this Agreement and (II) shall be  unsecured or rank pari passu or junior in right of security with any  Obligations outstanding under this Agreement and, if secured, shall not be  secured by any assets other than the Collateral (and, unless secured on a  pari passu basis with the Obligations, shall be subject to a subordination  agreement (if payment subordinated) and the Applicable Intercreditor  Agreements);  (2) as of the Refinancing Facility Closing Date, shall not  have a Maturity Date earlier than the Maturity Date of the Refinanced Debt;    106  (3) as of the Refinancing Facility Closing Date, such  Refinancing Term Loans shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity  not shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the  Refinanced Debt on the date of incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans;  (4) may provide for the ability to participate on a pro  rata basis or less than or greater than a pro rata basis in any voluntary  repayments or prepayments of principal of Term Loans hereunder and on a  pro rata basis or less than a pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro  rata basis) in any mandatory repayments or prepayments of principal of  Term Loans hereunder; provided that if such Refinancing Term Loans are  unsecured or rank junior in right of payment or as to security with the  Obligations, such Refinancing Term Loans shall participate on a junior  basis with respect to mandatory repayments of Term Loans hereunder  (except in connection with any refinancing, extension, renewal,  replacement, repurchase or retirement thereof permitted by this  Agreement);  (5) unless otherwise permitted hereby, shall not have a  greater principal amount than the principal amount of the Refinanced Debt  (plus the amount of any unused commitments thereunder), plus accrued  interest, fees, defeasance costs and premium (including call and tender  premiums), if any, under the Refinanced Debt, plus underwriting discounts,  fees, commissions and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront  fees and similar items) in connection with the refinancing of such  Refinanced Debt and the incurrence or issuance of such Refinancing Term  Loans; and  (6) shall not be guaranteed or incurred by any Subsidiary  other than a Credit Party hereunder;  (vii) Commitments in respect of Refinancing Term Loans shall become  additional Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (a &#8220;Refinancing  Amendment&#8221;) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Credit Documents,  executed by the Borrower, each Refinancing Term Lender providing such Commitments  and the Administrative Agent.  The Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of  any other Credit Party, Agent or Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and  the other Credit Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion  of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section  2.15(b).  The Borrower will use the proceeds, if any, of the Refinancing Term Loans in  exchange for, or to extend, renew, replace, repurchase, retire or refinance, and shall  permanently terminate applicable commitments under, substantially concurrently, the  applicable Refinanced Debt.  At the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower  shall deliver a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower, certifying that the  conditions and requirements with respect to such Refinancing Commitments and/or  Refinancing Term Loans set forth in this Section 2.15(b) have been met and such  </FONT></DIV>

(b) With respect to all Permitted Debt Exchanges effected by the Borrower  pursuant to this Section 2.17, (i) such Permitted Debt Exchanges (and the cancellation of the  exchanged Term Loans in connection therewith) shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory  payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 5.1 or 5.2, and (ii) such Permitted Debt Exchange  Offer shall be made for not less than $10,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Term Loans,  provided that subject to the foregoing clause (ii) the Borrower may at its election specify (A) as a  condition (a &#8220;Minimum Tender Condition&#8221;) to consummating any such Permitted Debt  Exchange that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Permitted Debt  Exchange Offer in the Borrower&#8217;s sole discretion) of Term Loans of any or all applicable Classes  be tendered and/or (B) as a condition (a &#8220;Maximum Tender Condition&#8221;) to consummating any  such Permitted Debt Exchange that no more than a maximum amount (to be determined and  specified in the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer in the Borrower&#8217;s sole discretion) of Term  Loans of any or all applicable Classes will be accepted for exchange.  (c) In connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, the Borrower and the  Auction Agent shall mutually agree to such procedures as may be necessary or advisable to  accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.17 and without conflict with Section 2.17(c); provided  that the terms of any Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall provide that the date by which the  relevant Lenders are required to indicate their election to participate in such Permitted Debt  Exchange shall be not less than a reasonable period (in the discretion of the Borrower and the  Auction Agent) of time following the date on which the Permitted Debt Exchange Offer is made.    109  (d) The Borrower shall be responsible for compliance with, and hereby agrees  to comply with, all applicable securities and other laws in connection with each Permitted Debt  Exchange, it being understood and agreed that (x) none of the Auction Agent, the Agents nor any  Lender assumes any responsibility in connection with the Borrower&#8217;s compliance with such laws  in connection with any Permitted Debt Exchange and (y) each Lender shall be solely responsible  for its compliance with any applicable &#8220;insider trading&#8221; laws and regulations to which such Lender  may be subject under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  2.18 Lender Claimants.  (a) In order for a Lender Claimant to cease being a Lender Claimant and to be  acknowledged as a Lender hereunder, such Lender Claimant shall submit to the Borrower (i)(a) in  the case of a Unknown First Lien Lender Claimant, evidence of the First Lien Claims beneficially  owned by such Lender Claimant or (b) in the case of a Funded Lender Claimant, evidence that  such Lender Claimant is a Funded Lender Claimant pursuant to the definition hereof, (ii) an  Administrative Questionnaire, (iii) duly completed IRS tax withholding forms pursuant to this  Agreement, (iv) any other documentation and information required by any Agent in connection  with its &#8220;know your customer&#8221; process and (v) a signature page to this Agreement (such items (ii)  to (v) collectively, the &#8220;Lender Claimant Onboard Documents&#8221;).  Promptly following receipt  of such items, if the Borrower determines in good faith that such Lender Claimant is entitled to be  a Lender hereunder, the Borrower shall forward the Lender Claimant Onboard Documents to the  Administrative Agent, together with a Borrower Direction to Add Lender, which shall specify (A)  that the Person submitting such evidence should be added to the Register as a Lender, (B) the  original principal amount of Term Loans to be credited to such Lender Claimant, (C) the amount  of paid-in-kind interest allocable to such Term Loans and which is to be added to the original  principal amount of the Term Loans and (D) the amount of cash held in the Lender Claimant  Reserve Account to be paid to such Lender Claimant, if any.  The Borrower shall calculate the  original principal amount of Term Loans to be credited to a Lender Claimant pursuant to the Plan.   Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the Lender Claimant Onboard Documents and based  solely on such Borrower Direction to Add Lender, (x) in respect of such Term Loans, such Lender  Claimant shall cease to be a Lender Claimant and shall have all rights of a Lender for purposes of  this Agreement and all other Credit Documents and (y) the Administrative Agent shall (AA) revise  the Register to credit such Term Loans to such Lender Claimant, (BB) increase the principal of  such transferred Term Loans with all paid-in-kind interest allocable to such Term Loans and (CC)  pay to such Lender Claimant the cash amounts held in the Lender Claimant Reserve Account  allocable to such transferred Term Loans.  In no event shall any Agent have any duty, liability or  obligation (I) to solicit or request delivery of any information or documents from any Lender  Claimant, (II) to review, verify or confirm any information or documents submitted by any Lender  Claimant or contained in any direction of the Borrower or (III) with respect to any calculation of  amounts due or payable to any Lender Claimant (including the amount of any principal or interest  credited to any Lender Claimant).  The Agents shall be entitled to rely, shall be fully protected in  relying, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon any Borrower Direction to Add Lender.  (b)   (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither  the Agents, the Borrower nor any other Person shall be liable to any Lender Claimant or to    110  any other Person for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned  property law, escheat law or similar law.  (ii) To the extent that (x) all Obligations under this Agreement and the  other Credit Documents (other than Obligations owing to any Lender Claimant, any  Hedging Obligations in respect of any Secured Hedging Agreement, any Cash  Management Obligations in respect of Secured Cash Management Agreements and any  Contingent Obligations) are paid in full within one (1) year of the Closing Date and (y) on  or after the date described in clause (x), the Borrower deposits in to the Lender Claimant  Reserve Account the full amount of all Term Loans (including all paid-in-kind interest  allocable to such Term Loans) then outstanding with respect to all Lender Claimants,  together with any prepayment premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest due on the  date of such deposit (the &#8220;Lender Claimant Obligation Amount&#8221;, and the occurrence of  the events described in clauses (x) and (y), a &#8220;Refinancing Event&#8221;), on the date of such  Refinancing Event, the Term Loans allocable to all Lender Claimants shall be deemed paid  in full for all purposes under this Agreement; provided that until the date that is one (1)  year after the Closing Date had such Refinancing Event not occurred (the &#8220;Claim  Termination Date&#8221;), the claims of all Lender Claimants with respect to the Lender  Claimant Obligation Amount shall survive.  At the written request of the Administrative  Agent, the Borrower shall deliver a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower,  certifying the amount of the Lender Claimant Obligation Amount and attaching a  reasonably detailed calculation with respect thereto (upon which the Administrative Agent  may conclusively rely without further investigation or inquiry).  The procedures set forth  in Section 2.18(a) shall continue to apply with respect to Lender Claimants from and after  the Refinancing Event until the Claim Termination Date. Any portion of the Term Loans  (together with all interest allocable to such Term Loans) remaining unclaimed by Lender  Claimants on the Claim Termination Date shall, on the Claim Termination Date, be deemed  to have been paid in full and any claims of a Lender Claimant with respect thereto shall  then be deemed extinguished.  (iii) Absent the occurrence of a Refinancing Event, any portion of the  Term Loans (including Term Loans resulting from any interest payments payable in kind)   (together with all interest allocable to such Term Loans) remaining unclaimed by Lender  Claimants on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (such Term Loans, the  &#8220;Unclaimed Loans&#8221; and such date, the &#8220;Unclaimed Loans Termination Date&#8221;) shall, on  the Unclaimed Loans Termination Date, be deemed to have been paid in full and any claims  of a Lender Claimant with respect thereto shall then be deemed extinguished.  (c) Any cash amounts that are held in the Lender Claimant Reserve Account  shall be applied by the Administrative Agent on the Claim Termination Date or the Unclaimed  Loans Termination Date, as applicable, after giving effect to the deemed repayment in full of the  Term Loans or Unclaimed Loans, as applicable, in accordance with clause (ii) or (iii) of Section  2.18(b), in accordance with Section 2.18(d).  (d) All amounts paid on the Claim Termination Date or the Unclaimed Loans  Termination Date, as applicable, from the Lender Claimant Reserve Account pursuant to clauses  (b) and (c) of this Section 2.18 shall be applied in the following order of priority:  </FONT></DIV>

(e) The Borrower hereby directs the Administrative Agent or an escrow agent  selected by the Borrower and reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to open and  maintain a segregated, non-interest bearing account entitled &#8220;Lender Claimant Reserve Account&#8221;  for the purpose of holding funds payable to Lender Claimants in accordance with this Agreement.   Funds held in the Lender Claimant Reserve Account shall remain uninvested.  (f) To the extent that a Refinancing Event occurs prior to the Maturity Date,  from the date of such Refinancing Event until the earlier of (i) the date that all Lender Claimants  have presented themselves and claimed all amounts contained in the Lender Claimant Reserve  Account in accordance with Section 2.18(a) and (ii) the date that the Administrative Agent has  applied amounts contained in the Lender Claimant Reserve Account in accordance with Section  2.18(d), all rights, powers, privileges, protections, immunities, and indemnities of the Agents and  all remaining obligations of the Borrower and the Agents described under this Agreement  (including this Section 2.18) with respect to the Lender Claimants and the Lender Claimant  Reserve Account shall continue and survive in full force and effect notwithstanding the fact that  all Obligations shall have been paid in full; provided that during such period, each Agent may  request and rely on the direction of the Borrower for all purposes on the same basis that it is entitled  to rely on the direction of the Required Lenders.  SECTION 3  [Reserved]  SECTION 4 Fees; Commitments  4.1 Fees  (a) In the event that, prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing  Date, (x) the Borrower makes any prepayment or repayment of Initial Term Loans pursuant to  Section 5.1 or Section 5.2(a)(ii) or (iii), or (y) any portion of the principal of the Initial Term Loans  is accelerated in accordance with Section 11 or applicable law (clauses &#8220;(x)&#8221; and &#8220;(y)&#8221; together,  the &#8220;Premium Trigger Events&#8221; and, each individually a &#8220;Premium Trigger Event&#8221;), the  Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Lender holding  Initial Term Loans and the Lender Claimant Reserve Account (in each case as of the date of such  prepayment), a prepayment premium of 2.00% of the principal amount of the Initial Term Loans  being prepaid (the &#8220;Prepayment Premium&#8221;).  For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent a  Premium Trigger Event occurs before the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, no    112  prepayment premium shall be due on account of any prepayment or repayment of Initial Term  Loans.  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay directly to the Agents, for the account of the  Agents, all fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Agent Fee Letter in immediately  available funds due and payable to the Agents, which fees shall be fully earned when paid and  shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay  any amounts to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 4.1 (subject to Section 2.16).  The Prepayment Premium shall be due in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of  ascertaining the actual amount of damages to the Lenders or profits lost by the Lenders as a result  of a Premium Trigger Event, and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable estimation  and calculation of the lost profits or damages of the Lenders as a result thereof.  ANY  PREPAYMENT PREMIUM PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.1(A) SHALL BE PRESUMED TO  BE EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY EACH LENDER AND THE  BORROWER AGREE THAT SUCH PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IS REASONABLE UNDER  THE CIRCUMSTANCES CURRENTLY EXISTING.  IF THE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM  BECOMES DUE AND PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE  PREPAYMENT PREMIUM SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL OF THE INITIAL  TERM LOANS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND INTEREST SHALL ACCRUE ON THE  FULL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH INITIAL TERM LOANS FROM AND AFTER THE  OCCURRENCE OF THE APPLICABLE PREMIUM TRIGGER EVENT.  IN THE EVENT THE  PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IS DETERMINED NOT TO BE DUE AND PAYABLE BY  ORDER OF ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT  LIMITATION, BY OPERATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, DESPITE SUCH  PREMIUM TRIGGER EVENT HAVING OCCURRED, THE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM  SHALL NONETHELESS BE DEEMED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL OF THE INITIAL TERM  LOANS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL NONETHELESS CONSTITUTE  OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ALL PURPOSES HEREUNDER.  THE  BORROWER EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE  STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE  PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PREMIUM TRIGGER EVENT,  IN EACH CASE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT SUCH WAIVER IS PERMITTED UNDER  APPLICABLE LAW.  THE BORROWER, THE AGENTS AND THE INITIAL TERM  LENDERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY PREPAYMENT PREMIUM DUE  AND PAYABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT  CONSTITUTE UNMATURED INTEREST.  THE BORROWER FURTHER  ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES, AND WAIVES ANY ARGUMENT TO THE  CONTRARY, THAT PAYMENT OF THE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM CONSTITUTES A  PENALTY OR AN OTHERWISE UNENFORCEABLE OR INVALID OBLIGATION.  THE  BORROWER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE (A) PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IS  REASONABLE AND IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ARM&#8217;S-LENGTH TRANSACTION  BETWEEN SOPHISTICATED BUSINESS PEOPLE, ABLY REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL,  (B) PREPAYMENT PREMIUM SHALL BE PAYABLE NOTWITHSTANDING THE THEN  PREVAILING MARKET RATES AT THE TIME PAYMENT IS MADE, (C) THERE HAS    113  BEEN A COURSE OF CONDUCT BETWEEN THE LENDERS AND THE BORROWER  GIVING SPECIFIC CONSIDERATION IN THIS TRANSACTION FOR SUCH  AGREEMENT TO PAY THE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM, (D) THE BORROWER SHALL  BE ESTOPPED HEREAFTER FROM CLAIMING DIFFERENTLY THAN AS AGREED TO  IN THIS SECTION, (E) ITS AGREEMENT TO PAY THE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IS  A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE LENDERS TO MAKE THE LOANS AND (F) THE  PREPAYMENT PREMIUM REPRESENTS A GOOD FAITH, REASONABLE ESTIMATE  AND CALCULATION OF THE LOSSES OR OTHER DAMAGES OF THE LENDERS AND  THAT IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DAMAGES TO THE LENDERS.  4.2 Mandatory Termination or Reduction of Commitments  The Initial Term Commitments described in clause (a) of the definition thereof shall  terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing Date.  SECTION 5 Payments  5.1 Voluntary Prepayments  The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Term Loans, without premium or  penalty (other than as provided in Section 4.1(a) with respect to the Initial Term Loans or as  otherwise provided with respect to Term Loans incurred after the Closing Date and amounts, if  any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.11 with respect to prepayments of SOFR Loans  made on any date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period), in whole or in part,  from time to time on the following terms and conditions:  (a) the Borrower shall give the  Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office revocable written notice of its intent to  make such prepayment, the amount of such prepayment and, in the case of SOFR Loans, the  specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made, which notice shall be given by the Borrower no  later than 1:00 p.m. (x) one Business Day prior to (in the case of ABR Loans) or (y) three U.S.  Government Securities Business Days prior to (in the case of SOFR Loans) such prepayment and  shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each Lender, (b) each partial  prepayment of (i) any SOFR Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in multiples  of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) any ABR Loans shall be in a minimum amount of  $1,000,000 and in multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof; provided that no partial prepayment of  SOFR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding SOFR Loans made  pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for SOFR  Loans and (c) any prepayment of SOFR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 on any day prior to the  last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto shall be subject to compliance by the Borrower  with the applicable provisions of Section 2.11.  Each prepayment in respect of any Term Loans  pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be (a) applied to the Class or Classes of Term Loans in such  manner as the Borrower may determine, (b) applied to reduce Repayment Amounts in such order  as the Borrower may determine and (c) applied to reduce the Type of Term Loans in the applicable  Class as the Borrower may determine.  In the event that the Borrower does not specify the order  in which to apply prepayments of Term Loans to reduce Repayment Amounts or prepayments of  Term Loans as between Classes of Term Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that  such prepayment be applied to reduce the Repayment Amounts in direct order of maturity on a pro    114  rata basis with the applicable Class or Classes, if a Class or Classes were specified, or among all  Classes of Term Loans then outstanding, if no Class was specified.  If the Borrower does not  specify the Type of Term Loans in the applicable Class, the Administrative Agent may make such  designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs  owing under Section 2.11.  At the Borrower&#8217;s election (by written notice to the Administrative  Agent) in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this Section 5.1, such prepayment shall not  be applied to any Term Loan of a Defaulting Lender.  5.2 Mandatory Prepayments  (a) Prepayment Events.  (i) On each occasion that an Asset Sale Prepayment  Event or a Recovery Prepayment Event occurs, the Borrower shall, within ten (10) Business Days  after the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds of such Prepayment Event (or, in the case of Deferred Net  Cash Proceeds, within three Business Days after the Deferred Net Cash Proceeds Payment Date),  prepay (or cause to be prepaid) (subject to Section 11.11 when applicable), in accordance with  clauses (c) and (d) below, Term Loans with a principal amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash  Proceeds from such Prepayment Event; provided that the percentage in this Section 5.2(a)(i) shall  be reduced to (A) 50% if the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio on the date of such  prepayment is less than or equal to 2.80 to 1.00 but greater than 2.30 to 1.00 and (B) 0% if the  Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio on the date of such prepayment is less than or equal  to 2.30 to 1.00; provided, further, that the Borrower may use a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds  to prepay or repurchase any Indebtedness (and with such prepaid or repurchased Indebtedness  permanently extinguished) to the extent such Indebtedness is secured with a Lien on the Collateral  ranking pari passu with the Lien securing the Initial Term Loans to the extent such Indebtedness  requires the issuer to prepay or make an offer to purchase or prepay such Indebtedness with the  proceeds of such Prepayment Event, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (x) the  amount of such Net Cash Proceeds multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the  outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness and with respect to which such a requirement  to prepay or make an offer to purchase or prepay exists and the denominator of which is the sum  of the outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness and the outstanding principal amount of  the Term Loans (it being understood that to the extent the holders of such Indebtedness decline to  have such Indebtedness repurchased or prepaid, the declined amount shall promptly (and in any  event within ten Business Days after the date of such rejection) be applied to prepay the Term  Loans in accordance with the terms hereof); provided, further, that (i) no prepayment shall be  required pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)(i) in the case of any individual Asset Sale Prepayment  Event or Recovery Prepayment Event yielding Net Cash Proceeds of less than $25,000,000 in the  aggregate and (ii) Net Cash Proceeds from such Prepayment Events shall only be required to be  applied to prepay Term Loans pursuant to this Section to the extent the Net Cash Proceeds from  such Prepayment Events exceed $100,000,000 in the aggregate for all such Prepayment Events  (other than those yielding Net Cash Proceeds under the threshold specified in clause (i) of this  proviso) in any one Fiscal Year, at which time all such Net Cash Proceeds referred to in this clause  (ii) with respect to such Fiscal Year shall be applied as a prepayment in accordance with this  Section 5.2(a)(i) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, only amounts in excess of such $100,000,000  threshold amount in clause (ii) of this proviso above shall be required to be applied as a prepayment  in accordance with this Section 5.2(a)(i)).  </FONT></DIV>

Following the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 2024,  not later than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which financial statements are delivered  pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (in any case no later than the end of any cure period under Section  11.3(b) applicable to the delivery of such financial statements) for any Fiscal Year (commencing  with the first full Fiscal Year completed after the Closing Date), the Borrower shall prepay Term  Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) below in a principal amount equal to, as applicable,  (i) (A) if the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio as of the end of such Fiscal Year is greater  than 2.80:1.00, 50% of the Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year, (B) if the Consolidated First  Lien Net Leverage Ratio as of the end of such Fiscal Year is equal to or less than 2.80:1.00 and  greater than 2.30:1.00, 25% of the Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year or (C) otherwise, 0% of  the Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year; minus (ii) to the extent any Indebtedness secured with  a Lien on the Collateral ranking pari passu with the Lien securing the Initial Term Loans also  requires the issuer of such Indebtedness to prepay or make an offer to purchase or prepay such  Indebtedness with the amount of Excess Cash Flow, the Borrower may reduce the amount  calculated pursuant to the provisions above by an amount not to exceed the product of (x) such  amount multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of  such Indebtedness and with respect to which such a requirement to prepay or make an offer to  purchase or prepay exists and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal  amount of such Indebtedness and the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans (it being  understood that to the extent the holders of such Indebtedness decline to have such Indebtedness  repurchased or prepaid, the declined amount shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)  Business Days after the date of such rejection) be applied to prepay the Term Loans in accordance  with the terms hereof); minus (iii) any voluntary prepayments or repurchases of Term Loans or  any other Indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the Initial Term Loans (unless such  prepayment or repurchase is funded with other long-term Indebtedness) made during such Fiscal  Year or, at the Borrower&#8217;s option and without duplication, after the end of such Fiscal Year and  prior to the time such Excess Cash Flow payment is due on a dollar-for-dollar basis (with the  Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio to be recalculated to give effect to any such after- Fiscal Year end payments); provided that (I) if for any Fiscal Year, the amounts calculated pursuant  to the provisions above is a negative amount, any such negative amount shall, at the option of the    116  Borrower, be carried forward in future Fiscal Years to reduce the required payments pursuant to  this Section 5.2(b) and (II) notwithstanding anything set forth above, any prepayment under this  Section 5.2(b) shall be required only if the required prepayment amount calculated pursuant to the  provisions above (including giving effect to any credit applied pursuant to clause (I) of this  proviso) exceeds $20,000,000, and only the amount in excess thereof shall be applied to make  prepayments of the Term Loans.  (c) Application to Repayment Amounts.  Each prepayment of Term Loans  required by Section 5.2(a) (except as provided in Section 5.2(a)(iii)) or Section 5.2(b) shall be  allocated to the Term Loans then outstanding (ratably to each Class of Term Loans (or on a less  than ratable basis, if agreed to by each Lender providing such Class of Term Loans) based on then  remaining principal amounts of the respective Classes of Term Loans then outstanding) until paid  in full.  In addition, each such prepayment shall be applied within each Class of Term Loans (i)  ratably among the Lenders holding the Term Loans of such Class (unless otherwise agreed by an  applicable affected Lender) and (ii) to scheduled amortization payments in respect of such Term  Loans in direct forward order of scheduled maturity thereof or as otherwise directed by the  Borrower.  (d) Application to Term Loans.  With respect to each prepayment of Term  Loans required pursuant to Section 5.2(a) (other than Section 5.2(a)(iii)) or Section 5.2(b), subject  to Section 11.11 in the case of Section 5.2(a)(ii) (when applicable), the Borrower may designate  the Types of Term Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which  made; provided that the Borrower pays any amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section  2.11 with respect to prepayments of SOFR Loans made on any date other than the last day of the  applicable Interest Period.  In the absence of a Rejection Notice or a designation by the Borrower  as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent may, subject to the above, make  such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage  costs owing under Section 2.11.  (e) [Reserved]  (f) Rejection Right.  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in  writing of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to Section  5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b), in each case at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date such  prepayment is required to be made (or such shorter period of time as agreed to by the  Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion).  Each such notice shall be revocable and specify  the anticipated date of such prepayment and the basis for such repayment and provide a reasonably  detailed estimated calculation of the amount of such prepayment.  The Administrative Agent will  promptly notify each Lender holding Term Loans to be prepaid in accordance with such  prepayment notice of the contents of the Borrower&#8217;s prepayment notice and of such Lender&#8217;s pro  rata share of the prepayment.  Each Lender may reject all or a portion of its pro rata share of any  such prepayment of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(i) or Section 5.2(b)  (such declined amounts, the &#8220;Declined Proceeds&#8221;) by providing written notice (each, a &#8220;Rejection  Notice&#8221;) to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower no later than 5:00 p.m. one Business Day  after the date of such Lender&#8217;s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such  prepayment.  Each Rejection Notice shall specify the principal amount of the mandatory  prepayment of Term Loans to be rejected by such Lender.  If a Lender fails to deliver a Rejection    117  Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice  fails to specify the principal amount of the Term Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be  deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such prepayment of Term Loans.  Any Declined  Proceeds remaining thereafter shall be retained by the Borrower (&#8220;Retained Declined Proceeds&#8221;).  (g) Foreign Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow.  Notwithstanding any  other provisions of this Section 5.2, (i) to the extent that the repatriation of any or all of the Net  Cash Proceeds from a Recovery Prepayment Event (a &#8220;Foreign Recovery Event&#8221;) of, or any  Disposition by, a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to an Asset Sale Prepayment Event (a  &#8220;Foreign Asset Sale&#8221;) or (ii) the repatriation of any Excess Cash Flow attributable to a Restricted  Foreign Subsidiary (&#8220;Foreign Excess Cash Flow&#8221;), are prohibited or delayed by applicable local  law (including financial assistance, corporate benefit, restrictions on upstreaming of cash intra- group and fiduciary and statutory duties of the directors of the relevant subsidiaries) or material  agreement (so long as not created in contemplation of such prepayment) or organizational  document from being repatriated to the United States or, if the Borrower has determined in good  faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Recovery Event or any  Foreign Asset Sale or any Foreign Excess Cash Flow would have an material adverse tax  consequence to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (or any direct or indirect parent  company of the Borrower), such portion of the Net Cash Proceeds or the Foreign Excess Cash  Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans, at the times provided in  this Section 5.2 but may be retained by the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary for working  capital purposes so long, but only so long, (i) as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation  to the United States (the Borrower hereby agreeing to promptly take commercially reasonable  actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or material agreement to permit such  repatriation) or (ii) as the Borrower determines in good faith such material adverse tax consequence  to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (or any direct or indirect parent company of the  Borrower) would be incurred, and once such repatriation is permitted under the applicable local  law or such material adverse tax consequence would no longer be incurred as determined by the  Borrower in good faith (and in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days after such  repatriation is permitted to occur or the Borrower determines in good faith that such material  adverse tax consequence would no longer be incurred) applied (net of additional taxes payable or  reserved against as a result thereof) apply an amount equal thereto to the repayment of the Term  Loans as required pursuant to this Section 5.2.  5.3 Method and Place of Payment  (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments under this  Agreement shall be made by the Borrower without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind,  to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto, as the case may  be, not later than 12:00 p.m., in each case, on the date when due and shall be made in immediately  available funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office or at such other office as the Administrative  Agent shall specify for such purpose by written notice to the Borrower, it being understood that  written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent to make a payment from  the funds in the Borrower&#8217;s account at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office shall constitute the  making of such payment to the extent of such funds held in such account.  All repayments or  prepayments of any Term Loans (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) hereunder and all  other payments under each Credit Document shall be made in Dollars.  The Administrative Agent    118  will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day (if payment was actually received by the  Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 p.m. or, otherwise, on the next Business Day) like funds  relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto.  (b) Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 12:00 p.m.  shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment  to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date  thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of  principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect  immediately prior to such extension.  5.4 Net Payments  (a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any  Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of,  and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes; provided that if the  Borrower or any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall be required by Applicable Law (as  determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) to deduct or withhold  any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the Administrative  Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and (ii) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the  Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant  Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in accordance with Applicable Law.  If such  a Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the Borrower or any Guarantor shall be increased  as necessary so that after making all such required deductions and withholdings (including such  deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.4), the  Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount  equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.   Whenever any Indemnified Taxes are payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as promptly as  practicable thereafter, the Borrower or Guarantor shall send to the Administrative Agent for its  own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original  official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as  applicable, acting reasonably) received by the Borrower or such Guarantor showing payment  thereof.  (b) The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority  Other Taxes in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of any Agent, timely reimburse  it for the payment of any Other Taxes that are paid by such Agent to the relevant Governmental  Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent,  the Collateral Agent and each Lender within fifteen Business Days after written demand therefor,  for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent, the Collateral  Agent or such Lender as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of  any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Credit Document  (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this  Section 5.4) payable or paid by such Agent or Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from  a payment to such Agent or Lender and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom  </FONT></DIV>

A certificate setting forth reasonable detail  as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy  to the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (as applicable) on  its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify each Agent, within ten (10) days  after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the  extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified such Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and  without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such  Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.6 relating to the maintenance of a  Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are  payable or paid by such Agent in connection with this Agreement or any Credit Document, and  any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereof, whether or not such Taxes were  correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as  to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by such Agent shall be  conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to set off and apply  any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any Credit  Document or otherwise payable by such Agent to the Lender from any other source against any  amount due to such Agent under this paragraph (d).  (e) Any Non-U.S. Lender claiming a basis for an exemption from or reduction  of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax  purposes, or under any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments  hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall, to the extent it is legally able to do so, deliver  to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by  Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such  properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such  payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding or as will permit the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be  made.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall  deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to  determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting  requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(e), the completion,  execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in  Section 5.4(f), 5.4(i) and 5.4(j) below) shall not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment  such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material  unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of  such Lender.  (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(e), each Non-U.S. Lender  with respect to any amounts payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall, to the  extent it is legally entitled to do so:  (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to  the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and    120  from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent), two executed copies of (x) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender  claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding Tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of  the Code with respect to payments of &#8220;portfolio interest&#8221;, United States Internal Revenue  Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (together with a certificate substantially in the form  of Exhibit J-1 representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank within the meaning of  Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of  Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower, and is not a controlled foreign  corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)),  (y) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8-BEN-E or Form W-8ECI, in each  case properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete  exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax on payments under any  Credit Document or (z) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner with  respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Credit  Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation or where Non-U.S. Lender  is a pass through entity) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all necessary  attachments (including the forms described in clauses (x) and (y) above and in Section  5.4(i), Exhibit J-2, Exhibit J-3 and or other certification documents from each beneficial  owner, as applicable); provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership it may provide  Exhibit J-4 on behalf of one or more of its direct or indirect partners that are claiming the  portfolio interest exemption; and  (ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further  copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or before the  date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any  respect and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form  previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  If in any such case any Change in Law has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery  would otherwise be required that renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Non- U.S. Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it, such Non-U.S.  Lender shall promptly so advise the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  (g) If any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as  applicable, determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it had received and  retained a refund of an Indemnified Tax or additional sums payable under this Section 5.4  (including an Other Tax) for which a payment has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this  Agreement, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender, the Administrative Agent or  the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower,  then the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall  reimburse the Borrower for such amount (net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender, the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than  any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such  refund) as the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be,  determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be the proportion of the refund as will  leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into account expenses or  any Taxes imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required;    121  provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the  Collateral Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest  or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) by the Lender, the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in the event the Lender, the Administrative Agent or  the Collateral Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  A Lender  shall claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its sole discretion  that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim.  None of any Lender, the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be obliged to disclose any information  regarding its tax affairs that it deems confidential to any Credit Party in connection with this clause  (g).  (h) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.12, each Lender and Agent agrees to  use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request to  minimize any amount payable by the Borrower or any Guarantor pursuant to this Section 5.4.  The  Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Lender and Agent harmless against any out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any request made by the Borrower pursuant  to this Section 5.4(h).  Nothing in this Section 5.4(h) shall obligate any Lender or Agent to take  any action that such Person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to  such Person.  (i) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(d), with respect to any  amounts payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document, each Lender or Agent that is a  United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (each, a &#8220;U.S. Lender&#8221;) shall deliver  to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two United States Internal Revenue Service Forms  W-9 (or substitute or successor form), properly completed and duly executed, certifying that such  Lender or Agent is exempt from United States backup withholding (i) on or prior to the Closing  Date (or on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that  such form expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) after the occurrence of a  change in such Agent&#8217;s or Lender&#8217;s circumstances requiring a change in the most recent form  previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and (iv) from time to time  thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  (j) If a payment made to any Agent or Lender would be subject to U.S. federal  withholding Tax imposed under FATCA if such Agent or Lender were to fail to comply with the  applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or  1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Agent or Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably  requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by  Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such other  documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as may be  necessary for the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to comply with their obligations under  FATCA, to determine whether such Agent or Lender has or has not complied with such Agent&#8217;s  or Lender&#8217;s FATCA obligations and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from  such payment and deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any  such documentation on or before the date that any such documentation expires or becomes obsolete  or inaccurate in any respect and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the  documentation previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  Solely for    122  purposes of this subsection (j), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to FATCA after  the date of this Agreement and any current or future intergovernmental agreements and any  Applicable Law implementing such agreement entered into in connection therewith.  (k) The agreements in this Section 5.4 shall survive the resignation or  replacement of any Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the  termination of this Agreement and the Commitments and the payment, satisfaction, or discharge  of the Term Loans and all other Obligations payable hereunder and under any other Credit  Document.  5.5 Computations of Interest and Fees  Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, interest on SOFR Loans and  ABR Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.  Interest  on ABR Loans in respect of which the rate of interest is calculated on the basis of the rate of  interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal  as the &#8220;U.S. prime rate&#8221; and interest on overdue interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-  (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.  5.6 Limit on Rate of Interest  (a) No Payment Shall Exceed Lawful Rate.  Notwithstanding any other term of  this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any interest or other amounts under or  in connection with this Agreement or otherwise in respect of the Obligations in excess of the  amount or rate permitted under or consistent with any Applicable Law.  (b) Payment at Highest Lawful Rate.  If the Borrower is not obliged to make a  payment that it would otherwise be required to make, as a result of Section 5.6(a), the Borrower  shall make such payment to the maximum extent permitted by or consistent with Applicable Laws.  (c) Adjustment if Any Payment Exceeds Lawful Rate.  If any provision of this  Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents would obligate the Borrower to make any  payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate that  would be prohibited by any Applicable Law, then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or  rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate  of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by Applicable Law, such adjustment  to be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be  paid by the Borrower to the affected Lender under Section 2.8.  (d) Spreading.  In determining whether the interest hereunder is in excess of the  amount or rate permitted under or consistent with any Applicable Law, the total amount of interest  shall be spread throughout the entire term of this Agreement until its payment in full.  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments  contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall have received from the Borrower an amount in excess  of the maximum permitted by any Applicable Law, then the Borrower shall be entitled, by notice  in writing to the Administrative Agent to obtain reimbursement from that Lender in an amount  </FONT></DIV>

With reasonable promptness, following the  reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, such other information (financial or otherwise) as  the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of any Lender (acting through the  Administrative Agent) may reasonably request in writing from time to time; provided that,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.1(f), none of Holdings, the Borrower or  any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will be required to provide any such other information pursuant  to this Section 9.1(f) to the extent that (i) the provision thereof would violate any attorney client  privilege (as reasonably determined by counsel (internal or external) to the Credit Parties), law,  rule or regulation, or any contractual obligation of confidentiality binding on the Credit Parties or  their respective Affiliates (so long as not entered into in contemplation hereof) or (ii) such  information constitutes attorney work product (as reasonably determined by counsel (internal or  external) to the Credit Parties).  (g) Projections.  Within 120 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the  Borrower ended after the Closing Date, a reasonably detailed consolidated budget for the following  Fiscal Year as customarily prepared by management of the Borrower for its internal use (including  a projected consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of the  end of such Fiscal Year, the related consolidated statements of projected cash flow and projected  income and a summary of the material underlying assumptions applicable thereto) (collectively,  the &#8220;Projections&#8221;), which Projections shall in each case be accompanied by a certificate of an  Authorized Officer of the Borrower stating that such Projections have been prepared in good faith  on the basis of the assumptions stated therein, which assumptions were based on good faith  estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable at the time  of preparation of such Projections, it being understood that such Projections and assumptions as to  future events are not to be viewed as facts or a guarantee of performance, are subject to significant  uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries, and that actual results may vary from such Projections and such differences may be  material.  (h) Reconciliations.  Simultaneously with the delivery of each set of  consolidated financial statements referred to in Sections 9.1(a) and (b) above, reconciliations for  such consolidated financial statements or other consolidating information reflecting the  adjustments necessary to eliminate the accounts of Unrestricted Subsidiaries (if any) from such  consolidated financial statements; provided that the Borrower shall be under no obligation to  deliver the reconciliations or other information described in this clause (h) if the Consolidated  Total Assets and the Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries  (which Consolidated Total Assets and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated in accordance  with the definitions of such terms, but determined based on the financial information of the  Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries, and not the financial information of the Borrower and  its Restricted Subsidiaries) do not differ from the Consolidated Total Assets and the Consolidated  EBITDA, respectively, of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries by more than 2.5%.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations in clauses (a), (b), (e) and (g) of this  Section 9.1 may be satisfied with respect to financial information of the Borrower and the  Restricted Subsidiaries by furnishing (A) the applicable financial statements of Holdings or any  direct or indirect parent of Holdings or (B) the Borrower&#8217;s (or Holdings&#8217; or any direct or indirect  parent thereof), as applicable, Form 8-K, 10-K or 10-Q, as applicable, filed with the SEC; provided    136  that, with respect to each of clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph, to the extent such information  relates to Holdings or a direct or indirect parent of Holdings, such information is accompanied by  consolidating or other information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the  information relating to Holdings or such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to  the Borrower and its consolidated Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand  (provided, however, that the Borrower shall be under no obligation to deliver such consolidating  or other explanatory information if the Consolidated Total Assets and the Consolidated EBITDA  of the Borrower and its consolidated Restricted Subsidiaries do not differ from the Consolidated  Total Assets and the Consolidated EBITDA, respectively, of Holdings or any direct or indirect  parent of Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries by more than 2.5%).  Documents required to  be delivered pursuant to clauses (a), (b) and (e) of this Section 9.1 (to the extent any such  documents are included in materials otherwise filed with the SEC) may be delivered electronically  and if so delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date (i) on which the Borrower  posts such documents, or provides a link thereto on the Borrower&#8217;s website as notified to the  Administrative Agent in writing and provides to the Administrative Agent by electronic mail  electronic versions (i.e., soft copies) of such documents; or (ii) on which such documents are  posted on the Borrower&#8217;s behalf on an Internet or intranet website, if any, or filed with the SEC,  and available in EDGAR (or any successor) to which each Lender and the Administrative Agent  have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the  Administrative Agent).  9.2 Books, Records and Inspections  (a) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, permit  officers and designated representatives of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (as  accompanied by the Administrative Agent) to visit and inspect any of the properties or assets of  the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary in whomsoever&#8217;s possession to the extent that it is  within such party&#8217;s control to permit such inspection (and shall use commercially reasonable  efforts to cause such inspection to be permitted to the extent that it is not within such party&#8217;s control  to permit such inspection), and to examine the books and records of the Borrower and any such  Restricted Subsidiary and discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and of any  such Restricted Subsidiary with, and be advised as to the same by, its and their officers and  independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and intervals and to such reasonable extent  as the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders may desire (and subject, in the case of any such  meetings or advice from such independent accountants, to such accountants&#8217; customary policies  and procedures); provided that, excluding any such visits and inspections during the continuation  of an Event of Default (i) only the Administrative Agent, whether on its own or in conjunction  with the Required Lenders, may exercise rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under  this Section 9.2, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall not exercise such rights more than one time in  any calendar year and (iii) only one such visit shall be at the Borrower&#8217;s expense; provided, further,  that when an Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent (or any of its representatives or  independent contractors) may do any of the foregoing at the expense of the Borrower at any time  during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice.  The Administrative Agent and  the Required Lenders shall give the Borrower the opportunity to participate in any discussions  with the Borrower&#8217;s independent public accountants.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  this Section 9.2, neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary will be required under this  Section 9.2 to disclose or permit the inspection or discussion of any document, information or    137  other matter to the extent that such action would violate any attorney-client privilege (as reasonably  determined by counsel (internal or external) to the Credit Parties), law, rule or regulation, or any  contractual obligation of confidentiality (not created in contemplation thereof) binding on the  Credit Parties or their respective Affiliates or constituting attorney work product (as reasonably  determined by counsel (internal or external) to the Credit Parties).  (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, maintain  proper books of record and account, in which entries that are full, true and correct in all material  respects and are in conformity, in all material respects, with GAAP shall be made of all material  financial transactions and matters involving the assets of the business of the Borrower or such  Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be (it being understood and agreed that any Restricted  Subsidiary may maintain its individual books and records in conformity with local standards or  customs and that such maintenance shall not constitute a breach of the representations, warranties  or covenants hereunder).  9.3 Maintenance of Insurance  The Borrower will, and will cause each Material Subsidiary that is a Restricted  Subsidiary to, at all times maintain in full force and effect, pursuant to self-insurance arrangements  or with insurance companies that the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of the  management of the Borrower, as applicable) are financially sound and responsible at the time the  relevant coverage is placed or renewed, insurance in at least such amounts (after giving effect to  any self-insurance which the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of management of the  Borrower, as applicable) is reasonable and prudent in light of the size and nature of its business)  and against at least such risks (and with such risk retentions) as the Borrower believes (in the good  faith judgment of management of the Borrower, as applicable) is reasonable and prudent in light  of the size and nature of its business and the availability of insurance on a cost-effective basis; and  will furnish to the Collateral Agent, upon written reasonable request from the Collateral Agent,  information presented in reasonable detail as to the insurance so carried, provided, however, that  for so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral Agent shall be  entitled to make such request only once in any calendar year. The Collateral Agent and its  successors and/or assigns shall be named as lender loss payee or mortgagee and/or additional  insured with respect to any insurance providing liability coverage or coverage in respect of any  Collateral, and the Borrower will cause each provider of any such insurance to agree, by  endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to  the Collateral Agent, that it will give the Collateral Agent thirty (30) days (or ten (10) days for  non-payment or such lesser amount as the Required Lenders may agree to in their sole direction)  prior written notice before any such policy or policies shall be altered or cancelled.  With respect  to each Mortgaged Property, if at any time the area in which any improvements located on any  Mortgaged Property is designated a &#8220;flood hazard area&#8221; in any Flood Insurance Rate Map  published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency), the  Borrower shall obtain flood insurance in such total amount as the Collateral Agent may from time  to time require and otherwise comply with the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in  the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended from time to time.    138  9.4 Payment of Taxes  The Borrower will pay and discharge, and will cause each of the Restricted  Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, all Taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies  imposed upon it or upon its income or profits, or upon any properties belonging to it, prior to the  date on which penalties attach thereto, and all lawful claims in respect of any Taxes imposed,  assessed or levied that, if unpaid, could reasonably be expected to become a material Lien upon  any properties of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that neither the Borrower  nor any such Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy  or claim (i) that is being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings if it has maintained  adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) with respect thereto  in accordance with GAAP or (ii) with respect to which the failure to pay would not reasonably be  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  9.5 Consolidated Corporate Franchises  The Borrower will do, and will cause each Material Subsidiary that is a Restricted  Subsidiary to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and  effect its existence, corporate rights and authority, except to the extent that the failure to do so  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that the  Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate any transaction otherwise permitted  hereby, including under Section 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 or 10.5.  9.6 Compliance with Statutes, Regulations, Etc.  The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, comply with all  Applicable Laws applicable to it or its property, including all governmental approvals or  authorizations required to conduct its business, and to maintain all such governmental approvals  or authorizations in full force and effect, in each case except where the failure to do so would not  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  9.7 Lender Calls  At the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall conduct  a conference call that Lenders may attend to discuss the financial condition and results of  operations of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended  measurement period for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 9.1(a)  or (b) (beginning with the fiscal period of the Borrower ended September 30, 2023), at a date and  time to be determined by the Borrower with reasonable advance notice to the Administrative  Agent, limited to one conference call per fiscal quarter.  9.8 Maintenance of Properties  The Borrower will, and will cause the Restricted Subsidiaries to, keep and maintain  all property material to the conduct of its business in good working order and condition (ordinary  wear and tear, casualty and condemnation excepted), except to the extent that the failure to do so  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  </FONT></DIV>

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Credit Document to the  contrary, the Borrower and the Guarantors shall not be required, nor shall the Collateral Agent be  authorized, (i) to perfect the above-described pledges, security interests and mortgages by any  means other than by (A) filings pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in the office of the  secretary of state (or similar central filing office) of the relevant State(s), (B) filings in United  </FONT></DIV>

SECTION 12 The Agents  12.1 Appointment  (a) Each Secured Party (other than the Administrative Agent) hereby  irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the administrative agent of such  Secured Party under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and irrevocably authorizes  the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions  of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such  duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and  the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.   The provisions of this Section 12 (other than this Section 12.1 and Sections 12.9, 12.12 and 12.13,  in each case, with respect to the Borrower) are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the other  Secured Parties, and the Credit Parties shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of such  provisions.  The Agents shall not be agents for the Lender Claimants and shall not have any duties  or obligations with respect to the Lender Claimants or the Term Loans attributed to such Lender  Claimants (and no Lender Claimant shall have any rights against any Agent, including to direct  any Agent), other than (i) maintenance of the Lender Claimant Reserve Account in accordance  with Section 2.18 and (ii) the crediting of their Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.18(a).  (b) The duties of each Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature;  and each Agent shall not have, by reason of any Credit Document, a fiduciary, principal-agency,  or trustee relationship in respect of any Lender or any other Secured Party.  Without limiting the  generality of the foregoing, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; in this Agreement or the other Credit  Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied  (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term  is used merely as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only a representative  relationship between independent contracting parties.  (c) The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Collateral  Agent to act as the collateral agent of such Secured Party with respect to the Collateral, and each  of the Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent, in such capacity, to take  such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents  and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Collateral  Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, together with such other  powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, including, without limitation, acquiring, holding and  enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Credit Parties to secure any of the  Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.     176  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders, and by accepting the benefits of the  Security Documents, any other Secured Parties, hereby expressly authorize the Collateral Agent  to (i) execute any and all documents with respect to the Collateral (including any release,  amendment, supplement, modification or joinder with respect thereto) and the rights of the Secured  Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this  Agreement and the Security Documents and acknowledge and agree that any such action by the  Collateral Agent shall bind the Secured Parties and (ii) negotiate, enforce or settle any claim, action  or proceeding affecting the Secured Parties in their capacity as such, at the direction of the  Required Lenders, which negotiation, enforcement or settlement will be binding upon each  Secured Party.  12.2 Delegation of Duties  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may each perform any and all  of its duties and execute any of its rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any  portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies  thereunder) by or through any one or more co-agents, sub-agents, or attorneys-in-fact and shall be  entitled to advice of counsel, both internal and external, and other consultants or experts  concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  The Agents and any such co-agents, sub-agents,  and attorneys-in-fact may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by  or through their respective Related Parties.  All provisions of this Section 12 and Section 13  (including Section 13.5) and all other rights, privileges, protections, immunities, and indemnities  granted to the Agents hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall apply to any such co- agents, sub-agents, and attorneys-in-fact, and to the Related Parties of the Agents and any such co- agents, sub-agents, and attorneys-in-fact.  No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or  misconduct of any such co-agents, sub-agents, or attorneys-in-fact selected by it except to the  extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment  that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such co- agents, sub-agents, and attorneys-in-fact.  12.3 Exculpatory Provisions  (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement  or in any other Credit Document, no Agent shall have any duties, responsibilities, or obligations  except those expressly set forth herein or in any other Credit Document, and no implied covenants,  functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any  other Credit Document or otherwise exist against such Agent.  The permissive rights of each Agent  to take any actions permitted by this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall not be  construed as an obligation or duty to do so.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each  Agent and its Related Parties:  (i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties or  obligations, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing;    177  (ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise  any discretionary powers, and shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action  under this Agreement or any other Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice  or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders  as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary) as it  deems appropriate, provided that such Agent shall not be required to take any action that,  in its good faith opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may (i) reasonably be expected to  expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Credit Document or applicable law  or (ii) be in violation of the automatic stay under any requirement of law relating to  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or relief of debtors; provided, further, that if such  Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified and provided with adequate security to its  reasonable satisfaction (including reasonable advances as may be requested by such Agent)  by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason  of taking or continuing to take any such directed action; provided, further, that such Agent  may seek clarification or further direction from the Required Lenders (or such other  number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe  in good faith shall be necessary) prior to taking any such directed action and may refrain  from acting until such clarification or further direction has been provided;  (iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit  Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,  any information relating to the Borrower, the Credit Parties, or any of their Affiliates that  is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as such Agent or any of its Related  Parties in any capacity;  (iv) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the  consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of  the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be  necessary) (and such consent or request and such action or action not taken pursuant thereto  shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all other Secured Parties) or (ii) in the absence  of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment (which shall not include any action taken  or omitted to be taken in accordance with clause (i), for which such Agent and its Related  Parties shall have no liability);  (v) shall not be responsible or liable for or have any duty to ascertain or  inquire into or monitor (i) any recital, statement, warranty or representation made in or in  connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any  certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to, provided for, or delivered  hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or  observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein  or therein, the use of proceeds of the Loans, or the occurrence or possible occurrence of  any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the execution, validity, enforceability, effectiveness,  genuineness, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement, any other Credit Document or  any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, preservation, perfection,  maintenance or continuation of perfection, or priority of any Lien purported to be created  by the Security Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, (vi) whether    178  the Collateral exists, is owned by any Credit Party, is cared for, protected, insured, or  maintained, or has been encumbered, or meets the eligibility criteria applicable in respect  thereof, (vii) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 6 or elsewhere, other than  to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent,  or the inspection of the properties, books or records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate  thereof, or (viii) the financial condition or business affairs of any Credit Party or any other  Person liable for the payment of any Obligations.  (b) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall require any  Agent or its Related Parties to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial  liability in the performance of any duties, obligations or responsibilities or in the exercise of any  right, power, authority or discretion hereunder or under the other Credit Documents.  (c) No Agent shall be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the  performance of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, in each case,  arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its control, including  without limitation, any act or provision of any present or future law or regulation or governmental  authority; acts of God; earthquakes; fires; floods; wars; terrorism; civil or military disturbances;  sabotage; epidemics; pandemics; riots; interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, computer  (hardware or software) or communications service; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or  military authority or governmental actions; or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire  or telex or other wire or communication facility.  (d) In no event shall any Agent be responsible or liable for any incidental,  special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including loss  of profit) irrespective of whether such Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or  damage and regardless of the form of action.  (e) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the other protections set  forth in this Section 12, with respect to any approval, determination, designation, or judgment to  be made by any Agent herein or in the other Credit Documents, such Agent shall be entitled to  request that the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be  necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary) make or confirm such  approval, determination, designation, or judgment.  (f) If at any time any Agent is served with any judicial or administrative order,  judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process (including orders of  attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or injunctions or stays relating to the transfer  of any Collateral), such Agent is authorized to comply therewith in any manner as it (in good faith)  or its legal counsel of its own choosing deems appropriate, and if such Agent complies with any  such judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or  administrative process, such Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other  Person even though such order, judgment, decree, writ or process may be subsequently modified  or vacated or otherwise determined to have been without legal force or effect.

(h) Each Lender acknowledges that (i) it is solely responsible for making its  own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with this  Agreement and the other Credit Documents, (ii) that it has, independently and without reliance  upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any other Lender or any of their respective  Related Parties, made its own appraisal and investigation of all risks associated with, and its own  credit analysis and decision to enter into, this Agreement based on such documents and  information, as it has deemed appropriate and (iii) it will, independently and without reliance upon  the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any other Lender or any of their respective Related  Parties, continue to be solely responsible for making its own appraisal and investigation of all risks  arising under or in connection with, and its own credit analysis and decision to take or not take  action under, this Agreement and the other Credit Documents based on such documents and  information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, which may include, in each case:  (i) the financial condition, status and capitalization of the Borrower and  each other Credit Party;  (ii) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of  this Agreement and each other Credit Document and any other agreement, arrangement or  document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with  any Credit Document;  (iii) determining compliance or non-compliance with any condition  hereunder to the making of a Term Loan and the form and substance of all evidence  delivered in connection with establishing the satisfaction of each such condition; and  (iv) the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information  delivered by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any other Lender or by any  of their respective Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement or any other  Credit Document, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any other  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,  under or in connection with any Credit Document.  12.4 Reliance by Agents  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, shall  be fully protected in relying, and shall not incur any liability for relying, (i) upon any instrument,  writing, resolution, notice, consent, request, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex, electronic    180  mail, or teletype message, statement, order or other document, communication or instruction  (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution)  believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, made, or  otherwise authenticated by the proper Person or Persons and (ii) upon advice and statements of  legal counsel (including counsel to Holdings and/or the Borrower), independent accountants and  other consultants or experts selected by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.  The  Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any  amount owing to such Lender hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such amount  is assigned by such Lender in accordance with Section 13.6.  12.5 Notice of Default  Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have  knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, has received written notice from a  Lender, Holdings or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event  of Default and stating that such notice is a &#8220;notice of default&#8221;.  In the event that the Administrative  Agent or the Collateral Agent receives such a notice, it shall give notice thereof to the Lenders,  the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable.  The Administrative Agent and  the Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall  be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (subject to the protections of Section 12.3);  provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,  shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as  applicable, may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,  with respect to such Default or Event of Default as is within its authority to take under this  Agreement and otherwise as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders except to  the extent that this Agreement requires that such action be taken only with the approval of the  Required Lenders or each of the Lenders, as applicable.  12.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Other  Lenders  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent, the  Collateral Agent or any of their Related Parties has made any representations or warranties to it  and that no act by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their Related Parties  hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Holdings, the Borrower, any other  Guarantor or any other Credit Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty  by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or their Related Parties to any Lender.  Each  Lender represents to Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent that it has, independently and  without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, or their Related Parties or any  other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made  its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other  condition and creditworthiness of Holdings, the Borrower, each other Guarantor and each other  Credit Party and made its own decision to make its Term Loans hereunder and enter into this  Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the  Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, or their Related Parties or any other Lender and based on  such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own    181  credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and  the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself  as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of  Holdings, the Borrower, each other Guarantor and each other Credit Party.  Except for notices,  reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the  Administrative Agent hereunder, the Agents and their Related Parties shall not have any duty or  responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,  assets, operations, properties, financial condition, prospects or creditworthiness of Holdings, the  Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Credit Party that may come into the possession of the  Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their Related Parties.  Each Lender agrees  that it will not assert any claim against any Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by  such Agent in connection with this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, or the transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby.  12.7 Indemnification  The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent and its Related Parties in their  capacities as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit Parties and without limiting the  obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to their respective principal amounts  of the outstanding Term Loans in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if  indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Term Loans shall have been paid in full,  ratably in accordance with their respective principal amounts of the outstanding Term Loans in  effect immediately prior to such date), and hold harmless such Agent and its Related Parties from  and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,  fees, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time occur  (including at any time following the payment of the Term Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or  asserted against such Agent or Related Party, including all fees, disbursements and other charges  of counsel to the extent required to be reimbursed by the Credit Parties pursuant to Section 13.5,  in any way relating to or arising out of the making of the Term Loans, the Commitments, this  Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to  herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted  by such Agent or Related Party under or in connection with any of the foregoing (SUBJECT TO  THE PROVISOS BELOW, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING IN WHOLE  OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE ORDINARY  NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON); provided that no Lender shall be liable  to any Agent for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,  penalties, actions, judgments, suits, fees, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such  Agent&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final and non-appealable  judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, further, that no action taken in accordance  with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as  shall be required by the Credit Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or  willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 12.7.  In the case of any investigation, litigation or  proceeding giving rise to any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,  judgments, suits, fees, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any  time occur, be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against any Agent or any of its Related Parties  in any way relating to or arising out of the making of the Term Loans, this Agreement, any of the  other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the    182  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent or its  Related Parties under or in connection with any of the foregoing (including at any time following  the payment of the Term Loans), this Section 12.7 applies whether any such investigation,  litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person.  Without limitation of the  foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse such Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs  or out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses) incurred by such Agent in  connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or  enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice  rendered in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document,  or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that such Agent is not  reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that such reimbursement  by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrower&#8217;s continuing reimbursement obligations with respect  thereto.  If any indemnity furnished to any Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such  Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity and  cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is  furnished; provided that in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to indemnify any Agent  against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or  disbursement in excess of such Lender&#8217;s pro rata portion thereof; and provided, further, this  sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability,  obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement resulting  from such Agent&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a final and non- appealable judgment of court of competent jurisdiction).  For the avoidance of doubt, each  Lender&#8217;s ratable share of any indemnity or reimbursement obligation owing hereunder shall be  calculated solely by reference to the Register and any Obligations owing to Lender Claimants (in  their capacities as such) shall not be included in calculating such indemnity or reimbursement  obligation.  12.8 Agents in their Individual Capacities  Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and  generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrower, any other Guarantor, and  any other Credit Party as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder and under the other  Credit Documents.  With respect to any Term Loans made by it, each Agent shall have the same  rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as any Lender and may  exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms &#8220;Lender&#8221; and &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall  include each Agent in its individual capacity.  12.9 Successor Agents  Each of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may resign at any time by  notifying the other Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of  resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Borrower (not  to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) so long as no Specified Default has occurred  and is continuing, to appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in the United  States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor  shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment  within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring  </FONT></DIV>

Upon the acceptance of a  successor&#8217;s appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be,  hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged  from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already  discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by the Borrower  (following the effectiveness of such appointment) to such Agent shall be the same as those payable  to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor Agent.  After  the retiring Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions  of this Section 12 (including Section 12.7) and Section 13.5 and all other rights, privileges,  protections, immunities, and indemnities granted to such Agent hereunder and the other Credit  Documents shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its co-agents, sub-agents  and attorneys-in-fact and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted  to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as an Agent.  12.10 [Reserved]  12.11 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim  In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,  reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any  Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Term Loan  shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective  of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be  entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest  owing and unpaid in respect of the Term Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid  and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of  the Secured Parties (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,  disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Agents and their respective Related Parties and  all other amounts due the Lenders, the Agents and their respective Related Parties under the Credit  Documents) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and    184  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable  on any such claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other  similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Secured Party to make  such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall  consent to the making of such payments directly to the Secured Parties, to pay to the  Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements  and advances of the Agents and their Related Parties, and any other amounts due the Agents and  their Related Parties under the Credit Documents (including Sections 4.1, 5.4, and 13.5).  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to  authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Secured  Party or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Secured Party  in any such proceeding.  12.12 Intercreditor Agreements  Each of the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to  enter into any Applicable Intercreditor Agreement contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto  acknowledge that any such Applicable Intercreditor Agreement to which the Collateral Agent  and/or the Administrative Agent is a party are each binding upon them.  Each Secured Party (a)  hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of any  such Applicable Intercreditor Agreement and (b) hereby authorizes and instructs the Collateral  Agent and the Administrative Agent to enter into any such Applicable Intercreditor Agreement  and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof.  In  addition, each Secured Party hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent  to enter into any other intercreditor arrangements to the extent required to give effect to the  establishment of intercreditor rights and privileges as contemplated and required by Section 10.2  of this Agreement.  12.13 Security Documents and Guarantee; Agents under Security Documents and  Guarantee  (a) Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent or  the Collateral Agent, as applicable, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to be  the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with respect to the Guarantee, the Collateral  and the Security Documents, as applicable.  Subject to Section 13.1, without further written  consent or authorization from any Secured Party, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,  as applicable, may execute any documents or instruments necessary to (x) subordinate any Lien  on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any  Credit Document to the holder of any Lien permitted under clauses (d), (g) and (l) of Section 10.2  or (y) enter into subordination or intercreditor agreements with respect to Indebtedness to the  extent the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is otherwise contemplated herein as being  a party to such intercreditor or subordination agreement (including the Applicable Intercreditor  Agreements).  The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Collateral    185  Agent by the Credit Parties on any Collateral shall be automatically released (i) upon the  termination of this Agreement and the payment of all Obligations hereunder (except for Hedging  Obligations in respect of any Secured Hedging Agreement, Cash Management Obligations in  respect of Secured Cash Management Agreements and Contingent Obligations) (provided that, for  all purposes under this Agreement, deposit by the Borrower of the Lender Claimant Obligation  Amount, if any, into the Lender Claimant Reserve Account pursuant to Section 2.18 shall be  deemed to be payment in full of such amounts) and the termination of all Commitments, (ii) upon  the sale or other Disposition of such Collateral (including as part of or in connection with any other  sale or other Disposition permitted hereunder) to any Person other than another Credit Party, to  the extent such sale or other Disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement  (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively, shall be fully protected in relying, and shall not  incur any liability for relying, on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Credit Party upon  its reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to the extent such Collateral is comprised of  property leased to a Credit Party, upon termination or expiration of such lease, (iv) if the release  of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other  percentage of the Lenders whose consent may be required in accordance with Section 13.1), (v) to  the extent the property constituting such Collateral is owned by any Guarantor, upon the release  of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee, (vi) as required to effect any sale or  other Disposition of Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Collateral Agent  pursuant to the Security Documents and (vii) if such assets constitute Excluded Collateral.  Any  such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other  than those being released) upon (or obligations (other than those being released) of the Credit  Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Credit Parties, including the proceeds of any sale,  all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral except to the extent otherwise  released in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Documents.  Additionally, the Secured  Parties hereby irrevocably agree that the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be automatically released  from the Guarantee upon consummation of any transaction resulting in such Subsidiary ceasing to  constitute a Restricted Subsidiary or upon becoming an Excluded Subsidiary; provided that,  without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, no Subsidiary Guarantor shall be  automatically released from its obligations under the Credit Documents solely by reason of such  Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary of the type described in clause (b) of the  definition thereof unless either (x) it is no longer a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Borrower or  (y) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary as a result of a sale or  transfer of Stock made for a bona fide business purpose of the Borrower and its Restricted  Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of evading the requirement hereunder to provide a Guarantee.   Upon request by any Agent at any time, the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of the  Lenders whose consent may be required in accordance with Section 13.1) shall confirm in writing  such Agent&#8217;s authority to release any Collateral or Guarantee pursuant to this Agreement or any  other Credit Document.  The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral  Agent, as applicable, and the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent agree, at the  Borrower&#8217;s expense, to execute and deliver any instruments, documents, and agreements  reasonably requested by the Borrower to evidence and confirm the release of any Guarantor or  Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, all without the further consent or  joinder of any Lender; provided, that (1) no Agent shall be required to execute any document or  take any action to evidence such release on terms that, in such Agent&#8217;s opinion or the opinion of  its counsel, could reasonably be expected to expose such Agent to liability or create any obligation    186  or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien without recourse to, or representation,  or warranty by such Agent, and (2) the Credit Parties shall have provided such Agent with such  certifications or documents as such Agent shall reasonably request in order to demonstrate that the  requested release is permitted under this Section 12.13(a).  (b) Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guarantee.  Anything contained  in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Holdings, the Borrower, the  Agents and each Secured Party hereby agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right  individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guarantee, it being understood  and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the Guarantee may be  exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with  the terms hereof and thereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security Documents  may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties, and (ii) in the  event of a foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or  private sale or other Disposition, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may be the  purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other Disposition and the  Collateral Agent, as collateral agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any  Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall  otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or  payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale,  to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any  collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other Disposition.  For the avoidance of  doubt, no Agent shall be required to take title to the Collateral.  No holder of Hedging Obligations  under Secured Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Obligations under Secured Cash  Management Agreements shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of  any Collateral or of the obligations of any Credit Party under this Agreement.  No holder of  Hedging Obligations under Secured Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Obligations under  Secured Cash Management Agreements that obtains the benefits of any Guarantee or any  Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any other Credit Document shall have any right  to notice of any action or to consent to or vote on, direct or object to any action hereunder or under  any other Credit Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or  impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender or Agent and, in such case,  only to the extent expressly provided in the Credit Documents.  Notwithstanding any other  provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Agent shall be responsible or have any liability for  or in connection with, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor, maintain, update or  enforce compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Secured Hedging Agreements and  Secured Cash Management Agreements, and no Agent shall be deemed to have notice of any  Obligations under any Secured Hedging Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements  unless such Agent has received written notice thereof, together with such supporting  documentation as such Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge  Bank, as the case may be.  12.14 Lender Direction  Each Lender authorizes and directs the Agents to enter into, and agrees to be bound  by, this Agreement, the Security Documents, and the other Credit Documents, including, without  limitation, each Credit Document to be executed by any Agent.  Each Lender hereby acknowledges  </FONT></DIV>

Each Lender agrees  that any action taken by any Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other  Credit Documents relating to the Collateral and the exercise by each Agent of its powers set forth  therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be  binding upon all of the Lenders.  12.15 Erroneous Distribution  (a) If any Agent notifies a Lender or Secured Party, or any other Person (other  than any Credit Party or any Affiliate of a Credit Party) who has received funds on behalf of a  Lender or Secured Party (any such Lender, Secured Party, or other recipient, a &#8220;Payment  Recipient&#8221;) that such Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of  any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment  Recipient from such Agent or any of its Related Parties were erroneously transmitted to, or  otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known  to such Payment Recipient) (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or  repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an  &#8220;Erroneous Payment&#8221;) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof),  such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of such Agent and shall be  segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of such Agent, and such  Lender or Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds  on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two (2)  Business Days thereafter, return to such Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or  portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so  received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such  Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such  amount is repaid to such Agent in same day funds at the greater of the (x) a rate determined by  such to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be conclusive  absent manifest error) and (y) a rate determined by such in accordance with banking industry rules  on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.  A notice of any Agent to any Payment  Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (b) Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender or  Secured Party (or any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf), hereby further  agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment,  prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from any Agent (or  any of its Related Parties) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that  specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by such Agent (or any of its  Related Parties) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded  or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by such Agent (or any of  its Related Parties), or (z) that such Lender or Secured Party, or other such Payment Recipient  otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part)  in each case:    188  (i) it acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the case of immediately  preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written  confirmation from such Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case  of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment,  prepayment or repayment; and  (ii) such Lender or Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment  Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to)  promptly (and, in all events, within one (1) Business Day of its knowledge of such error)  notify such Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details  thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying such Agent pursuant to this Section  12.15(b).  For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to such Agent pursuant to this Section  12.15(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipient&#8217;s obligations pursuant to Section  12.15(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made.

(d) The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether an Agent may be  equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered  from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for  any reason, such Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests of such Payment Recipient  (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or other  Secured Party, to the rights and interests of such Lender or other Secured Party, as the case may  be) under the Credit Documents with respect to such amount (the &#8220;Erroneous Payment  Subrogation Rights&#8221;) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or  otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Credit Party; provided that  this Section 12.15(d) shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have  the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Borrower or any  other Credit Party relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would  have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by such Agent; provided, further,  that for the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to  the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous  Payment that is, comprised of funds received by such Agent from the Borrower or any other Credit  Party for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and for the  avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the occurrence of an Erroneous Payment (or the existence of  any Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights or other rights of any Agent in respect of an Erroneous  Payment) result in such Agent becoming, or being deemed to be, a Lender hereunder or the holder  of any Term Loans hereunder.    189  (f) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay,  repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Credit  Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the  amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by any Agent from the  Borrower or any other Credit Party for the purpose of paying, prepaying, repaying, discharging or  otherwise satisfying any Obligations.  (g) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert  any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any  claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim  or counterclaim by any Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without  limitation, waiver of any defense based on &#8220;discharge for value&#8221; or any similar doctrine.

SECTION 13 Miscellaneous  13.1 Amendments, Waivers and Releases  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Credit Documents (including Section  2.10(e)), neither this Agreement nor any other Credit Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof,  may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this  Section 13.1.  The Required Lenders may (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or, with the  written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent  may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the relevant Credit Party or Credit Parties written  amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the  purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or changing in  any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Credit Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive  in writing, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent  and/or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the  requirements of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any Default or Event of Default  and its consequences;

Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply  equally to each of the affected Lenders and shall be binding upon Holdings, the Borrower, the  applicable Credit Parties, such Lenders, the Agents and all future holders of the affected Term  Loans.

In connection with the  foregoing provisions, the Agents may, but shall have no obligations to, with the concurrence of  any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of such Lender.

(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate  of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount  of the assigning Lender&#8217;s Commitment or Term Loans of any Class, the amount of  the Commitment or Term Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such  assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect  to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent), shall not be less than  $1,000,000, unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise  consents (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, conditioned  or denied); provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if a  Specified Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, further, that  contemporaneous assignments to a single assignee made by Affiliates of Lenders  and related Approved Funds shall be aggregated for purposes of meeting the  minimum assignment amount requirements stated above;  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a  proportionate part of all the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this  Agreement; provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the  assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and  obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Term Loans;  (C) The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to  the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a  processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided that only one such  processing and recordation fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous  assignments by or among a Lender and its Affiliates (i.e. assignments submitted on  a single ClearPar ticket); provided, further, that the Administrative Agent may, in  its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of  any assignment; and  (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the  Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire, the applicable tax forms as    198  required under Section 5.4, and any documentation and information required by  any Agent under applicable law or regulation in connection with its &#8220;know your  customer&#8221; process.  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to clause  (b)(v) of this Section 13.6, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment  and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the  interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of  a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of  the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations  under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of  the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall  cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10,  2.11, 5.4 and 13.5).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under  this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 13.6 shall be treated for purposes of  this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in  accordance with clause (c) of this Section 13.6 (other than attempted assignments or  transfers in violation of the last paragraph of Section 13.6(b)(i) above, which shall be null  and void as provided above).  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary  agent of the Borrower solely with respect to the actions described in this Section  13.6(b)(iv), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in the United States a copy  of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the  names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and  stated interest) of the Term Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from  time to time (the &#8220;Register&#8221;).  Further, each Register shall contain the name and address  of the Administrative Agent and the lending office through which each such Person acts  under this Agreement.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest  error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders  shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof  as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the  contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by Holdings, the Borrower, the  Collateral Agent and any Lender (solely with respect to its own outstanding Term Loans  and Commitments), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior  notice to the Administrative Agent.  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption  executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee&#8217;s completed Administrative  Questionnaire and all the requested tax forms and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; documents and  information to the extent required hereunder (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender  hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in clause (b) of this Section 13.6  (unless waived by the Administrative Agent) and any written consent to such assignment  required by clause (b) of this Section 13.6, the Administrative Agent shall promptly accept  such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the  Register.  </FONT></DIV>

For the avoidance of doubt, the  Administrative Agent shall have no obligation with respect to, and shall bear no responsibility or  liability for, the monitoring or enforcing of the list of Disqualified Institutions with respect to the  sales of participations at any time.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells  such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this  Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may  provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any consent,  amendment, modification, supplement or waiver described in clause (i) or (iv) of the second  proviso of the first paragraph of Section 13.1 that directly and adversely affects such Participant.   Subject to clause (c)(ii) of this Section 13.6, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be  entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 5.4 to the same extent as if it were a Lender, and  provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the requirements and limitations of those  Sections and Sections 2.12 and 13.7(a) as though it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by  assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.6.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,  each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.8(b) as though it were a Lender;  provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.8(a) as though it were a Lender.   Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use  reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 13.7 with  respect to any Participant.  (i) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment  under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to  receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the  participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent.  (ii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this  purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the  name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each  Participant&#8217;s interest in the Term Loans (or other rights or obligations) held by it (the  &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;).  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent  manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the  Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement    200  notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose  all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or  any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of  credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document) to any Person except to the  extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of  credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United  States Treasury Regulations.  (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of Holdings, the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its  rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or  assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 13.6 shall not apply  to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment  of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any  such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  (e) Subject to Section 13.16, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose  (other than to any Disqualified Institutions) to any Participant, secured creditor of such Lender or  assignee (each, a &#8220;Transferee&#8221;), any prospective Transferee and any prospective direct or indirect  contractual counterparties to any swap or derivative transactions to be entered into in connection  with or relating to Term Loans made hereunder any and all financial information in such Lender&#8217;s  possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates that has been delivered to such Lender by  or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or that has been delivered  to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates in connection with such Lender&#8217;s  credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement.  (f) SPV Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,  any Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an &#8220;SPV&#8221;),  identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent  and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Term Loan that such  Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this  Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make  any Term Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide  all or any part of such Term Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Term Loan  pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a Term Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the  Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Term Loan were made by  such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any  indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain  with the Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which  agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year  and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior  indebtedness of any SPV, it shall not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting  against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation  proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.

provided that to  the extent any assignment to an Affiliated Lender would result in the aggregate principal  amount of the applicable Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders exceeding such 25%  threshold at the time of such purchase, the purchase of such excess amount will be void ab  initio.  Each Lender that sells its Term Loans pursuant to this Section 13.6 acknowledges and agrees that  (i) Holdings and its Subsidiaries may come into possession of additional information regarding the  Term Loans or the Credit Parties at any time after a repurchase has been consummated pursuant  </FONT></DIV>

(b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in  addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Applicable Law, each Lender shall  have the right, without prior notice to Holdings or the Borrower, any such notice being expressly  waived by Holdings and the Borrower to the extent permitted by Applicable Law but with the prior  written consent of the Administrative Agent, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the  Borrower hereunder (whether at the Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and  appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or  demand, provisional or final) (other than payroll, trust, tax, fiduciary, employee health and  benefits, pension, 401(k) and petty cash accounts), in any currency, and any other credits,  indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or  contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or  agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower.  Each Lender agrees promptly    205  to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing after any such set-off and  application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the  validity of such set-off and application.  13.9 Counterparts; Electronic Execution  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement  on any number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission),  and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same  instrument.

(g) Each of the Lenders, Holdings, and the Borrower acknowledges and agrees  that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the  Agents are not responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender  that are added to the Platform, and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with  such distribution.  Each of the Lenders, Holdings and the Borrower hereby approves distribution  of the Communications through the Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such  distribution.

The obligation of the Borrower in respect  of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the  other Credit Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#8220;Judgment  Currency&#8221;) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable  provisions of this Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement Currency&#8221;), be discharged only to the extent that  on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so  due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking  procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the  Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent  from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and  notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom  such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so  purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the  Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other  Person who may be entitled thereto under Applicable Law).  13.21 Cashless Rollovers  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any  other Credit Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or replaces,  renews or refinances, any of its then-existing Term Loans by way of an Incremental Amendment,  an Extension Amendment, a Refinancing Amendment or any other amendment to this Agreement,  in each case, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing is effected by means  of a &#8220;cashless roll&#8221; by such Lender, such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be  deemed to comply with any requirement hereunder or any other Credit Document that such  payment be made &#8220;in Dollars&#8221;, &#8220;in immediately available funds&#8221;, &#8220;in cash&#8221; or any other similar  requirement.  13.22 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Credit Document or in any other  agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges  that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Credit Document, to the extent  such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA  Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:    213  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA  Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any  party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and  (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if  applicable:  (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other  instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a  bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares  or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect  to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Credit Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the  exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
