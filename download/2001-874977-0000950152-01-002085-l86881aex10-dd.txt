                             FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE
                          REINSURANCE POOLING AGREEMENT
                            AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF
                                 JANUARY 1, 2000

         This First Amendment to the Reinsurance Pooling Agreement Amended and
Restated as of January 1, 2000, (the "2000 Pooling Agreement") by and among
State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company ("State Auto Mutual"), State Auto
Property and Casualty Insurance Company ("State Auto P&C"), Milbank Insurance
Company ("Milbank"), Midwest Security Insurance Company ("Midwest"), Farmers
Casualty Insurance Company ("Farmers Casualty") and State Auto Insurance Company
("State Auto IC"), made this 2nd day of March, 2001, but is effective November
17, 2000.

                                   BACKGROUND

         The 2000 Pooling Agreement includes references to the "State Auto P&C
Catastrophe Assumption Agreement" (as defined in the 2000 Pooling Agreement)
with limits of coverage equal to $135,000,000 excess of $120,000,000.

         As of November 17, 2000, the State Auto P&C Catastrophe Assumption
Agreement was amended to reduce the limit of catastrophe cover provided to
$115,000,000, excess of $120,000,000.

         The 2000 Pooling Agreement requires amendment to track with the amount
of catastrophe coverage available from the State Auto P&C Catastrophe Assumption
Agreement.

                             STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

         In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the Pooled Companies agree to amend the 2000 Pooling
Agreement as follows:

         1.       Capitalized terms used in the First Amendment which are not
                  otherwise defined herein are defined in the 2000 Pooling
                  Agreement and those definitions shall apply in this First
                  Amendment.

         2.       Wherever the defined term "State Auto P&C Catastrophe
                  Assumption Agreement" appears in the 2000 Pooling Agreement it
                  is understood and agreed that such term means the Property
                  Catastrophe Overlying Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contract
                  dated originally July 1, 1999, as amended from time to time,
                  under which State Auto P&C provides property catastrophe
                  reinsurance in an amount equal to that available to State Auto
                  P&C through a structured contingent financing arrangement
                  effected through State Auto P&C's immediate parent with one or
                  more other financial institutions.

         3.       Subsection (a) of Section 7 - Premiums Payable by State Auto
                  Mutual, is deleted and replaced by the following:

                  (a) STATE AUTO P&C: Commencing with the effective date of this
                  Agreement, State Auto Mutual hereby agrees to pay to State
                  Auto P&C its Respective


<PAGE>   3

                  Percentage of the Net Premiums written by the parties hereto.
                  Similarly, commencing with the effective date of this
                  Agreement, all losses, loss expenses, underwriting expenses,
                  and administrative expenses chargeable to underwriting of the
                  parties hereto (except for losses, loss expenses, underwriting
                  expenses and administrative expenses chargeable to the State
                  Auto Mutual Reinsurance Book), including the policyholder
                  dividends, less all losses and expenses recovered and
                  recoverable under reinsurance ceded to reinsurers other than
                  the parties hereto, (except for catastrophe reinsurance ceded
                  by State Auto Mutual, Farmers Casualty, Midwest Security,
                  Milbank and State Auto IC to State Auto P&C pursuant to the
                  Property Catastrophe Overlying Excess of Loss Reinsurance
                  Contract dated originally July 1, 1999, as amended from time
                  to time, under which State Auto P&C provides property
                  catastrophe reinsurance in an amount equal to that available
                  to State Auto P&C through a structured contingent financing
                  arrangement effected through State Auto P&C's immediate parent
                  with one or more other financial institutions ("State Auto P&C
                  Catastrophe Assumption Agreement")) shall be prorated among
                  the parties on the basis of the Respective Percentage of each.
                  Accounts shall be rendered at quarterly intervals and shall be
                  settled within sixty (60) days thereafter.

         4.       The second sentence of Section 10 - Losses Excluded, is
                  deleted and replaced by the following:

                  Once the amount of coverage currently available under the
                  State Auto P&C Catastrophe Assumption Agreement is exhausted
                  by loss expenses and loss payments on behalf of any party
                  hereto, under either the State Auto P&C Catastrophe Assumption
                  Agreement or directly, all parties understand and agree that
                  catastrophe losses in excess of the sum of the retention under
                  the State Auto P&C Catastrophe Assumption Agreement and the
                  amount of coverage then currently available under the State
                  Auto P&C Catastrophe Assumption Agreement shall once again be
                  ceded and assumed under the terms of the 2000 Pooling
                  Agreement, as amended.

         Except as amended herein the 2000 Pooling Agreement shall continue in
full force and affect.

         By their signatures hereon the parties hereby agree to the foregoing
First Amendment.
