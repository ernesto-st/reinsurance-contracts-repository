increase, any such new Lender states its Commitment amount and agrees to assume

$1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Eurodollar Advances
upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent.

     2.8  Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances. The
          ---------------------------------------------------------------
Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurodollar
Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time. The Borrower
shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") not later than
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one Business Day before the Borrowing Date of
each Floating Rate Advance and three Business Days before the Borrowing Date for
each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

          (i)   the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
     Advance,

          (ii)  the aggregate amount of such Advance,

          (iii) the Type of Advance selected, and

          (iv)  in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period
     applicable thereto.

     Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender
shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available in Chicago
to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII. The Agent will
make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the
Agent's aforesaid address.

     2.9  Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate
          ---------------------------------------------------
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating
Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section
2.9 or are repaid in accordance with

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Section 2.7. Each Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance
until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time
such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically converted into a Floating Rate
Advance unless (x) such Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with
Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Agent a
Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of
such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance continue as a Eurodollar Advance
for the same or another Interest Period. Subject to the terms of Section 2.6,
the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a
Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance. The Borrower shall give the
Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each conversion
of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance or continuation of a
Eurodollar Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three
Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation,
specifying:

          (i)   the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
     conversion or continuation,

          (ii)  the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
     converted or continued, and

          (iii) the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into or
     continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest Period
     applicable thereto.

     2.10 Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear
          -----------------------------
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a
Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but
excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant
to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such
day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained
as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in
the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate determined by the Agent as applicable to
such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8
and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. No Interest Period
may end after the Facility Termination Date. The Borrower shall select Interest
Periods so that it is not necessary to repay any portion of a Eurodollar Advance
prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period in order to make a
mandatory repayment required pursuant to Section 2.2.

     2.11 Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to the
          ------------------------------
contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a Default or
Unmatured Default no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a
Eurodollar Advance. During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders
may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at
the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder
of the applicable

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate otherwise applicable to such Interest
Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus
2% per annum, provided that, during the continuance of a Default under Section
7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be
applicable to all Advances without any election or action on the part of the
Agent or any Lender.

     2.12 Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be
          -----------------
made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds
to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at
any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to
the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be applied
ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Agent for
the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such
Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a
notice received by the Agent from such Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to
charge the account of the Borrower maintained with Bank One for each payment of
principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

     2.13 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. (i) Each Lender shall
          --------------------------------------------
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by
such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (ii)  The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record
     (a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
     Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or
     interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to
     each Lender hereunder and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Agent
     hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

          (iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
     paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
     existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided,
     however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such
     accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
     of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.

          (iv)  Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a
     promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit A (including any
     amendment, modification, renewal or replacement thereof, a "Note").  In
     such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender
     such Note payable to the order of such Lender.  Thereafter, the Loans
     evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
     after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or
     more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee
     pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or
     assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests
     that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

     paragraphs (i) and (ii) above. Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer
     of any Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such
     Lender's Note, and, in the case of any such loss, theft destruction or
     mutilation, upon cancellation of such Note, the Borrower will issue, in
     lieu thereof, a replacement Note in the same principal amount thereof and
     otherwise of like tenor.

     2.14 Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the
          ------------------
Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of
Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or
persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of
the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is
specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation
Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent
or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

     2.15 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on
          ----------------------------------------------
each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which
the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise,
and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal
amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day
other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest
accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its
applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is
prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued
on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months
shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such
Interest Period. Interest, facility and utilization fees shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable
for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount
paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment.
If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a
day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension
of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

     2.16 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender
----------
of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
The Agent will notify each Lender of the Eurodollar Rate applicable to each
Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will
give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.

     2.17 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
          ---------------------
Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation
from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending
Installation and the Loans and any

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of
any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent
and the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or
additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for
whose account Loan payments are to be made.

     2.18 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as
          ---------------------------------
the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled
to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a
Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or
fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to
make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The
Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment
available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such
Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to
the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to
the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect
of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made
available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate
per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the
interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by
the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

     2.19 Replacement of Lender. If the Borrower is required pursuant to
          ---------------------
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances
into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender
so affected an "Affected Lender"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts
continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such
Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or
Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i)
another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances
and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes
under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be
terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3
applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected
Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees
and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the
Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without
limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5,
and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to
such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of
such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the
replacement Lender.

                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES
                             -----------------------

     3.1  Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
          ----------------
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

          (i)   subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to
     any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with
     respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Eurodollar
     Loans, or

          (ii)  imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
     assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
     against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
     by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves
     and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate
     applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

          (iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
     the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making,
     funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or reduces any amount
     receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in
     connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or any
     applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference
     to the amount of Eurodollar Loans held or interest received by it, by an
     amount deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction in amount received.

     3.2  Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines the
          ---------------------------------------
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand by such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate
for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital
which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its
Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's
policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date
of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of
or change in any other law, governmental

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this
Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3  Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines that
          ---------------------------------
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then
the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any
affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

     3.4  Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs
          -----------------------
on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether
because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not
made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by
the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost
incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or
cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such
Eurodollar Advance.

     3.5  Taxes. 3.5.1 (i) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
          -----
any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such
deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish
to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30
days after such payment is made.

          (ii)  In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or
     future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes,
     charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
     under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with
     respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

          (iii) The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and each
     Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
     limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this
     Section 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including
     penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
     thereto.  Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within 30
     days of the date the Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to
     Section 3.6.

          (iv)  Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
     United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender")
     agrees that it will, not more than ten Business Days after the date of this
     Agreement, (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly
     completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
     W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
     payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
     United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of the
     Borrower and the Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9, as
     the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption from
     United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further
     undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or
     additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the
     date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the
     occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so
     delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be
     reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent. All forms or amendments
     described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is
     entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
     withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
     (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
     occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
     required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent
     such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment
     with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that
     it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or
     withholding of United States federal income tax.

          (v)   For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
     provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv),
     above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation,
     or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
     governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
     originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
     entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes
     imposed by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which
     is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax
     become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
     under clause (iv), above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Non-
     U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to
     recover such Taxes.

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

          (vi)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
     withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note
     pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall
     deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times
     prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
     documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to
     be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

          (vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
     authority of the United States or any other country or any political
     subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
     withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because
     the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such
     Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which
     rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other
     reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid,
     directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or
     otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by
     any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent under this subsection,
     together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto (including
     reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable time charges of attorneys for the
     Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent).  The obligations of
     the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the
     Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     3.6  Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
          ----------------------------------------
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such
written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon
which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of
amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall
be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the
purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used
as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan,
whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the
amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on
demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations
of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                         ------------------------------

     The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

     5.1  Corporate Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its
          --------------------------------
Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has
all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which
its business is conducted.

     5.2  Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the corporate power and
          --------------------------
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to
perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower
of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have
been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable
against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     5.3  No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery
          -------------------------------
by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions
therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the Borrower's or any of
its Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation or by-laws or the provisions of any
indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is
bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument
or agreement, other than such violations, conflicts or defaults which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization, or
validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, any
governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is
required to authorize, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery
and

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of,
any of the Loan Documents.

     5.4  Financial Statements. The December 31, 2000 audited consolidated
          --------------------
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the September 30,
2001 unaudited  consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the Lenders (the "Financial Statements")
were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present the
consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries at such dates and the consolidated results of their operations for
the periods then ended.

     5.5  Material Adverse Change. As of the date hereof, since December 31,
          -----------------------
2000, there has been no change in the business, Property, prospects, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     5.6  Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United States
          -----
federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and
have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment
received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any,
as are being contested in good faith and as to which, in the good faith judgment
of the Borrower, adequate reserves have been provided. The United States income
tax returns of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the
Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995. No tax
liens have been filed and no claims against the Borrower or its Subsidiaries are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes except claims being contested in
good faith and as to which, in the good faith judgment of the Borrower, adequate
reserves have been provided. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental
charges are adequate in the good faith judgment of the Borrower.

     5.7  Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
          -------------------------------------
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (after giving effect to reserves which have been
provided with respect thereto on the books of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries). As of the date hereof, the Borrower has no material Contingent
Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the Financial Statements. Solely
for purposes of any reaffirmation of the foregoing representations pursuant to
Section 4.2(ii) in connection with any Loans the proceeds of which are used to
repay maturing commercial paper Indebtedness, such representations shall not
extend to any proceeding in which a punitive damages judgment has been entered
against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, such judgment has been stayed on appeal
or the time for appeal from such judgment has not expired and such judgment
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents.

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

     5.8  Subsidiaries. Schedule "1" hereto contains an accurate list of all of
          ------------
the Significant Subsidiaries of the Borrower in existence on the date of this
Agreement, setting forth their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and the
percentage of their respective capital stock owned by the Borrower or other
Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such
Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-
assessable.

     5.9  ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do not in
          -----
the aggregate exceed $10,000,000. Each Plan complies in all material respects
with all applicable requirements of law and regulations. No Reportable Event has
occurred with respect to any Plan and neither the Borrower nor any other members
of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so,
which occurrence or withdrawal could result in a Material Adverse Effect. No
steps have been taken to terminate any Plan which has Unfunded Liabilities.

     5.10 Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or repor furnished by
          -----------------------
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or to any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents
contained any material misstatement of fact, omitted to state a material fact or
omitted to state any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading in any material respect.

     5.11 Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes
          ------------
less than 25% of those assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are
subject to any limitation on sale, pledge or other restriction hereunder.

     5.12 Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
          -------------------
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any agreement to which it is a party, which default
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Borrower nor any Significant Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions
contained in any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

     5.13 Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have complied
          --------------------
with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any
domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or agency thereof, having
jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of
their respective Property, except where the failure to so comply could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that its operations are
not in material compliance with any of the requirements of applicable federal,
state and local environmental, health and safety statutes and regulations or the
subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial
action is needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or
substance into the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.14 Ownership of Properties. Except for Liens permitted by Section 6.14,
          -----------------------
on the date of this Agreement the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have good title
to all of the Property and assets reflected in the Financial Statements as owned
by it, free of all Liens other than those permitted by this Agreement, except
for assets sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business since the date of such Financial Statements.

          ----------------------
thereof is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     5.16 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
          ----------------------------------

          ------------------
shall be revised or supplemented from time to time to reflect withdrawals or
changes in jurisdictions permitted by Section 6.4 or additional jurisdictions
set forth in the Annual Statements furnished pursuant to Section 6.1(vii)) lists
all of the jurisdictions in which any Significant Insurance Subsidiary holds
active Licenses and is authorized to transact insurance business. No such
License is the subject of a proceeding for suspension or revocation, there is no
sustainable basis for such suspension or revocation, and to the Borrower's best
knowledge, no such suspension or revocation has been threatened by any
Governmental Authority. Schedule "2" also indicates the type or types of
insurance in which each such Insurance Subsidiary is permitted to engage with
respect to each License therein listed. None of the Insurance Subsidiaries
transacts any insurance business, directly or indirectly, in any state other

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES
                 ----------------------------------------------

     8.1  Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
          ------------
with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent
or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Agent
with the consent of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations
to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

     If, before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due
shall have been obtained or entered, the Modified Required Lenders (or, in the
case of an automatic termination upon the occurrence of a Default under Section
7.6 or 7.7, all the Lenders), in their sole discretion, shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

     8.2  Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
          ----------
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or thereunder
or waiving any Default hereunder or thereunder; provided, however, that no such
                                                --------  -------
supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender:

          (i)   Extend the Facility Termination Date or the Revolving Credit
     Termination Date, compromise or forgive the principal amount of any Loan,
     or reduce the rate of

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

     interest or compromise or forgive payment of interest on any Loan, or
     reduce the amount of any fee payable hereunder.

          (ii)  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
     Lenders or Modified Required Lenders.

          (iii) Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder
     (except pursuant to Section 2.5(b)), or permit the Borrower to assign its
     rights under this Agreement.

          (iv)  Amend this Section 8.2.

     No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall
be effective without the written consent of the Agent. The Agent may waive
payment of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent
of any other party to this Agreement.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the execution and delivery of all
documentation required by Section 2.5(b) to be delivered in connection with an
increase to the Aggregate Commitment, the Agent, the Borrower and the new or
existing Lenders whose Commitments have been affected may and shall enter into
an amendment hereof (which shall be binding on all parties hereto) solely for
the purpose of reflecting any new Lenders and their new Commitments and any
increase in the Commitment of any existing Lender.

     8.3  Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
          ----------------------
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full.

                               ------------------

          ---------------------------
the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the Loans
herein contemplated.

     9.2  Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
          -----------------------

provisions of the Loan Documents.

     9.4  Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
          ----------------
understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than the fee letter
described in Section 10.13.

     9.5  Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
          -----------------------------------------------
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of
its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any
right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties
hereto expressly agree that the Arrangers shall enjoy the benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth
therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf
and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.

     9.6  Expenses; Indemnification. The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent for
          -------------------------
any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may
be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review, amendment, modification,
and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse
the Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys
for the Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees
of the Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent, any
Arranger or any Lender in connection with the collection of the Obligations or
the enforcement of the Loan Documents. The Borrower further agrees to indemnify
the Agent, the Arrangers and each Lender, its directors, officers and employees
against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
expenses (collectively, the "indemnified obligations") (including, without
limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not
the Agent, any Arranger or any Lender is a party thereto, but excluding those
indemnified obligations arising solely from any Lender's failure to perform its
obligations under this Agreement) which any of them may pay or incur arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder, except that no indemnified
party shall be indemnified for any indemnified obligations arising from its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

     9.7  Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents, and

          ----------
terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations
hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.

     9.9  Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that
          --------------------------
is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation,
enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

     9.10 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on the
          -----------------------
one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of
borrower and lender. Neither the Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender shall have
any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower. Neither the Agent, any Arranger
nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform
the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's
business or operations. The Borrower agrees that neither the Agent, any Arranger
nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in tort,
contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in connection with,
arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the
relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which
recovery is sought. Neither the Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender shall have
any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and
agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

     9.11 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
          ---------------
information which it may receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and
their respective Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other
professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee, (iii) to regulatory
officials, (iv) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law,
regulation, or legal process, (v) to any Person in connection with any legal
proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (vi) to such Lender's direct or
indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or to legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors to such counterparties, and (vii)
permitted by Section 12.4.

     9.12 Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying on
          -----------
or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) for the repayment of
the Loans provided for herein.

                                      -37-

                                    THE AGENT
                                    ---------

     10.1 Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank One, NA is hereby appointed
          -----------------------------------
by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as
the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the
Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting
as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to
those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency
theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of
which claims each Lender hereby waives.

     10.2 Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
          ------
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

     10.3 General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
          ----------------
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except
to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

     10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor any
          -------------------------------------------
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have
any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except
receipt of items required to be delivered solely to

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

the Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured
Default; (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or
priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial condition
of the Borrower or any guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the
Borrower's or any such guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have
no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be
furnished by the Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily
furnished by the Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in
its individual capacity).

     10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
          ---------------------------------
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

     10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of its
          --------------------------------
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

     10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
          ------------------------------
upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

     10.8 Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
          -----------------------------------------
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities,

                                      -39-

expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection
therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without
limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan
Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a
final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii)
any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in
accordance with the provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under
this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

     10.9   Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
            -----------------
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder unless
the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such
a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

     10.10  Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
            ------------------
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

     10.11  Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
            ----------------------
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arrangers or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arrangers or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     10.12  Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving written
            ---------------
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent has been
appointed, forty-five days after the

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

retiring Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. The Agent may be removed
at any time with or without cause by written notice received by the Agent from
the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the
Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Agent's giving notice of
its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the
Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any
Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor
Agent hereunder. If the Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor
Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent
hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations
to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such
successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be
a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the
Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean
the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

     10.13  Agent and Arranger Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent
            -----------------------
and Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., for their respective accounts, the fees
agreed to by the Borrower, the Agent and Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. pursuant
to that certain letter agreement dated October 16, 2001, or as otherwise agreed
from time to time.

     10.14  Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree that
            ------------------------
the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

     10.15  Documentation Agents, Syndication Agent, etc. None of the Lenders
            --------------------------------------------
identified in this Agreement as the "Documentation Agents" or the "Syndication"
Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty
under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to
have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the
Agent in Section 10.11.

                            ------------------------

     11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
          ------
Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

     11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
          ----------------
payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will
hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with
setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
in proportion to their Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal
process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
                -------------------------------------------------

     12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
          ----------------------
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of
this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any
pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a
Lender which is a fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its
obligations to its trustee; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment
creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its
obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with
the provisions of Section 12.3. The Agent may treat the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless
and until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the
Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions
from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments
relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to
any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all
the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or
consent

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a
Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on
any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

     12.2 Participations.
          --------------

          12.2.1  Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
                  ------------------------------
     ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
     any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
     participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by
     such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such
     Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender
     of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
     under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain
     solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
     obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder
     of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the
     Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement
     shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating
     interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
     directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
     obligations under the Loan Documents.

          12.2.2  Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
                  -------------
     approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than
     any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
     Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require
     consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of
     any other Loan Document.

          12.2.3  Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
                  -----------------
     shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in
     respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
     Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
     were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided
     that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1
     with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each
     Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each
     Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1,
     agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the
     exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance
     with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

     12.3 Assignments.
          -----------

          12.3.1  Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course
                  ---------------------
     of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
     to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of
     its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Such assignment shall
     be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

     other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the
     Borrower and the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
     effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate
     thereof; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is
     continuing, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required. Such consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such assignment with
     respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall
     (unless each of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an
     amount not less than the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining
     amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment (calculated as at the date of
     such assignment) or outstanding Loans (if the applicable Commitment has
     been terminated).

          12.3.2  Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an
                  ----------------------
     assignment, together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii)
     payment of a $4,000 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment, such
     assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such
     assignment.  The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser
     to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of
     the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement
     constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and
     interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be
     "plan assets" under ERISA.  On and after the effective date of such
     assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
     Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the
     Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the
     Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto,
     and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent
     shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the
     percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such
     Purchaser.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant
     to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower
     shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be
     evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as
     appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new
     Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser,
     in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments,
     as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

     12.4 Dissemination of Information.  The Borrower authorizes each Lender to
          ----------------------------
disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided that each
Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this
Agreement.

     12.5 Tax Treatment.  If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to
          -------------
any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

          -----------------
change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the
other parties hereto.

taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may

===============================================================================

     Subject to the following two sentences, a particular Level Status shall
exist on a particular day if on such day the Borrower does not qualify for a
Level Status with more advantageous pricing  and either the Moody's Rating or
the S&P Rating is at least equal to the corresponding rating specified for such
Level Status in the table above.  In the event of a differential in Ratings of
one level, Level Status shall be determined by reference to the higher of the
two Ratings.  In the event of a differential in Ratings of more than one  level,
the applicable Level Status shall be that Level Status one below the Level
Status which would have been applicable had the lower Rating been the same as
the higher Rating.  The above ratings are in the format of S&P Rating/Moody's
Rating.

__________________________

*    The Utilization Fee shall be payable only with respect to outstanding
     Advances on days when Utilization is greater than 33%. "Utilization" means,
     for any day, a percentage equal to the aggregate principal amount of Loans
     hereunder and "Loans" and "Reimbursement Obligations" (each as defined in
     the Five-Year Agreement) outstanding on such day (and at the close of
     business on such day if a Business Day) divided by the sum on such day of
     the Aggregate Commitment and the "Aggregate Commitment" under the Five Year
     Agreement; provided that for purposes of computing the Utilization Fee (a)
     the Aggregate Commitment shall be deemed to in no event be less than the
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans and (b) the "Aggregate
     Commitment" (as defined in the Five Year Agreement) shall be deemed to in
     no event be less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
     "Loans" and "Reimbursement Obligations" (each as defined in the Five Year
     Agreement).

**   Means less than
***  Means less than
<PAGE>

     For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the following
meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

     "Level Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III
Status, Level IV Status or Level V Status.

     "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by
Moody's and then in effect.

     "Rating" means Moody's Rating or S&P Rating.

     "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by S&P and
then in effect.

     The Applicable Margin and Applicable Fee Rate shall be determined in
accordance with the foregoing table based on the Borrower's Status as determined
from its then-current Moody's and S&P Ratings.  The Rating in effect on any date
for the purposes of this Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on
such date.  If at any time the Borrower has no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating
or the Borrower does not qualify for a Level Status with more advantageous
pricing, Level V Status shall exist.
