aggregate amount of the Swingline Loans (the "Refunded Swingline Loans")
outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay the applicable Swingline
Lender. Each U.S.$ Revolving Lender shall make the amount of such U.S.$
Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in
immediately available funds, not later than 10:00 A.M., Local Time, one Business
Day after the date of such notice. The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be
immediately made available by the Administrative Agent to the applicable
Swingline Lender for application by such Swingline Lender to the repayment of
the Refunded Swingline Loans. The applicable Borrower irrevocably authorizes
such Swingline Lender to charge the applicable Borrower's accounts with the
Administrative Agent (up to the amount available in each such account) in order
to immediately pay the amount of such Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent
amounts received from the U.S.$ Revolving Lenders are not sufficient to repay in
full such Refunded Swingline Loans.

                  (c) If prior to the time a Revolving Loan would have otherwise
been made pursuant to Section 2.7(b), one of the events described in Section
8(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to any Borrower or if
for any other reason, as determined by any Swingline Lender in its sole
discretion, U.S.$ Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section
2.7(b), each U.S.$ Revolving Lender shall, on the date such Revolving Loan was
to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 2.7(b), purchase
for cash (in U.S. Dollars) an undivided participating interest in the then
outstanding Swingline Loans by paying to the applicable Swingline Lender an
amount (the "Swingline Participation Amount") equal to (i) such U.S.$ Revolving
Lender's Revolving Percentage times (ii) the sum of the Dollar Equivalent of the
aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding that were to have
been repaid with such U.S.$ Revolving Loans. In furtherance of the foregoing, if
on any date the U.S.$ Revolving Lenders are required to purchase a participating
interest in Canadian Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph (c) then on such
date the payment obligations (including in respect of principal thereof and
unpaid interest thereon) of the Canadian Borrower in respect of such Canadian
Swingline Loan shall be converted to U.S. Dollars (at the Dollar Equivalent
thereof).

                  (d) Whenever, at any time after any Swingline Lender has
received from any U.S.$ Revolving Lender such Lender's Swingline Participation
Amount, such Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the respective
Swingline Loans, such Swingline Lender will distribute to such U.S.$ Revolving
Lender its Swingline Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case
of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such U.S.$
Revolving Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the
case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such U.S.$ Revolving
Lender's pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to
pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided,
however, that in the event that such payment received by such Swingline Lender
is required to be returned, such U.S.$ Revolving Lender will return to such
Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the
Swingline Lender.

                  (e) Each U.S.$ Revolving Lender's obligation to make the Loans
referred to in Section 2.7(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant
to Section 2.7(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense
or other right that such U.S.$ Revolving Lender or any Borrower may have against
any Swingline Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default or an
Unmatured Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions
specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or
<PAGE>
                                                                              31



otherwise) of any Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Lender or
(v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

         2.8 COMMITMENT FEES, ETC. (a) Dura agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each U.S.$ Revolving Lender a commitment fee for the
period from and including the date hereof to the last day of the Revolving
Commitment Period, computed at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily
amount of the Available Revolving Commitment of such U.S.$ Revolving Lender
during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears on
each Fee Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof.

                  (b) DASI and each Borrower agrees to pay to each Arranger, the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent the fees in the amounts and on the
dates as set forth in any fee agreements with such party and to perform any
other obligations contained therein.

         2.9 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITMENTS. DASI shall have
the right, upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Administrative
Agent, to terminate the U.S.$ Revolving Commitments, the Euro Revolving
Commitments or the Pounds Sterling Revolving Commitments or, from time to time,
to reduce the amount of the U.S.$ Revolving Commitments, the Euro Revolving
Commitments or the Pounds Sterling Revolving Commitments; provided that no such
termination or reduction of any Revolving Commitments shall be permitted if,
after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans and
Swingline Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Total Revolving
Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total U.S.$ Revolving Commitments or the
aggregate principal amount of the Total Euro Revolving Commitments or the Total
Pounds Sterling Revolving Commitments, as the case may be. Any such reduction
shall be an amount equal to U.S.$1,000,000, or a whole multiple thereof, and
shall reduce permanently the applicable Revolving Commitments then in effect.
The Total U.S.$ Revolving Commitments shall not at any time be reduced below the
Total Euro Revolving Commitments or the Total Pounds Sterling Revolving
Commitments.

         2.10 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Any Borrower may at any time and from time
to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon
irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent, no later than 11:00
A.M., Local Time, three Business Days prior thereto, in the case of Eurocurrency
Loans, and no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day prior
thereto, in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify the date and
amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of (i) a specific Type of
Loan and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each and (ii) (A)
Tranche C Term Loans, (B) U.S.$ Revolving Loans, Euro Revolving Loans or Pounds
Sterling Revolving Loans or (C) a combination thereof, as the case may be, and
if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each, provided, that if a
Eurocurrency Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, the applicable Borrower shall also pay any amounts
owing pursuant to Section 2.20. Upon receipt of any such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any
such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and Swingline Loans), accrued interest
to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Tranche C Term Loans
and Revolving Loans shall be in an aggregate principal Dollar Equivalent amount
of U.S.$1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof. Partial prepayments of Swingline
Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of
$100,000 or a whole multiple thereof.

         2.11 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS AND REVOLVING COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS. (a) If
(i) any Indebtedness is issued or incurred by DASI or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to Section 7.2(f) or (g), the
<PAGE>
                                                                              32


proceeds of which are not concurrently applied to the other purposes specified
in Section 7.2(f) or (g) and (ii) as of the end of the fiscal quarter
immediately preceding the issuance or incurrence of such Indebtedness the Senior
Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00, then an amount equal to
100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied on the date of such
issuance or incurrence toward the prepayment of the Tranche C Term Loans and the
reduction of the U.S.$ Revolving Commitments as set forth in Section 2.11(d).

                  (b) If on any date DASI or any Subsidiary shall receive Net
Cash Proceeds from any Disposition (other than Excepted Asset Sales) or Recovery
Event then, unless a Reinvestment Notice shall be delivered in respect thereof,
such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied on such date toward the prepayment of
the Tranche C Term Loans and the reduction of the U.S. Revolving Commitments as
set forth in Section 2.11(d); provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, on
each Reinvestment Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Reinvestment
Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant Reinvestment Event shall be
applied toward the prepayment of the Tranche C Term Loans and the reduction of
the Revolving Commitments as set forth in Section 2.11(d). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries shall apply the Net Cash
Proceeds of Dispositions to either (i) prepay the Tranche C Term Loans and
reduce the U.S.$ Revolving Commitments or (ii) acquire or repair assets useful
in their business before the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries shall be required
to apply such Net Cash proceeds to make any payment, purchase or redemption in
respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes or the Subordinated Indebtedness.

                  (c) If as of the end of any fiscal year, beginning with the
fiscal year December 31, 2004, the Senior Leverage Ratio is greater than or
equal to 2.25 to 1, the Borrowers shall prepay Term Loans and reduce the U.S.$
Revolving Commitments as set forth in Section 2.11(d) within 90 days following
the end of such fiscal year in a Dollar Equivalent amount equal to the lesser of
(i) 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year and (ii) the minimum amount
that when applied to repay Term Loans and reduce the U.S.$ Revolving Commitments
causes the Senior Leverage Ratio to be less than 2.25 to 1 (computed on a pro
forma basis as if such prepayment had been made as of the end of such fiscal
year).

                  (d) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments and
U.S.$ Revolving Commitment reductions made pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be
applied, first, to the prepayment of the Tranche C Term Loans in accordance with
Section 2.17(b) and, second, to reduce permanently the U.S.$ Revolving
Commitments. Any such reduction of the U.S.$ Revolving Commitments shall be
accompanied by prepayment of the Revolving Loans and/or Swingline Loans to the
extent, if any, that the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed the amount
of the Total U.S.$ Revolving Commitments as so reduced, provided that if the
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans then
outstanding is less than the amount of such excess (because L/C Obligations
constitute a portion thereof), the Borrowers shall, to the extent of the balance
of such excess, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an amount
in cash in a cash collateral account established with the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. The application of any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11
shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans and Canadian Prime Rate Loans and,
second, to Eurocurrency Loans. Each prepayment of the Loans under Section 2.11
(except in the case of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and Swingline
Loans) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of such prepayment
on the amount prepaid.

                  (e) Subject to Section 2.20, if on any Computation Date the
Administrative Agent shall have determined that the then outstanding Dollar
Equivalent principal amount of all Revolving Loans plus (without duplication)
the amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Total U.S.$ Revolving Commitments
by more than U.S.$2,000,000 due to a change in applicable rates of exchange
between U.S. Dollars, on the one hand, and Euros, Pounds Sterling or Canadian
Dollars, on the other hand, then the
<PAGE>
                                                                              33


Administrative Agent shall give notice to DASI that a prepayment is required
under this subsection, and the applicable Borrowers agree thereupon to make
prepayments of Loans such that, after giving effect to such prepayment, the
outstanding Dollar Equivalent amount of all Revolving Loans plus (without
duplication) the amount of all L/C Obligations does not exceed the Total U.S.$
Revolving Commitments.

         2.12 CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OPTIONS. (a) Any Borrower (other than
the Canadian Borrower) may elect from time to time to convert Eurocurrency Loans
in any currency to Base Rate Loans in such currency by giving the Administrative
Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such
election, provided that any such conversion of Eurocurrency Loans may only be
made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Any Borrower
may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans in any currency to
Eurocurrency Loans in such currency by giving the Administrative Agent at least
three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election (which notice
shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor), provided that
(i) no Base Rate Loan under a particular Facility may be converted into a
Eurocurrency Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in their
sole discretion not to permit such conversions and (ii) at no time may any
Borrower elect to convert any or all of its U.S. Swingline Loans from Base Rate
Loans to Eurocurrency Loans. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.

                  (b) Any Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
applicable Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set
forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable
to such Loans, provided that no Eurocurrency Loan under a particular Facility
may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have
determined in their sole discretion not to permit such continuations. If any
Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this
paragraph with respect to any Loan in U.S. Dollars or if such continuation is
not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such U.S. Dollar Loans shall be
automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring
Interest Period. If any Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as
described above in this paragraph with respect to any Loan in Pounds Sterling or
Euro or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso
such Loans shall be automatically continued as Eurocurrency Loans with a new
Interest Period of one month's duration. Upon receipt of any such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.

         2.13 LIMITATIONS ON EUROCURRENCY TRANCHES. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of
Eurocurrency Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such
amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect
thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurocurrency Loans comprising
each Eurocurrency Tranche shall be equal to the Minimum Tranche and (b) no more
than ten Eurocurrency Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time for all
Revolving Loans and no more than three Eurocurrency Tranches shall be
outstanding at any one time for all Tranche C Term Loans.

         2.14 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES. (a) Each Eurocurrency Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined for such day plus the
Applicable Margin.

                  (b) Each Base Rate Loan (including each Swingline Loan which
is a Base Rate Loan) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
<PAGE>
                                                                              34


                  (c) Each Canadian Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (d) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any
Loan or Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate
that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this Section plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the
rate applicable to Base Rate Loans under the U.S.$ Revolving Facility plus 2%,
and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation or any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder
shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility (or, in
the case of amounts denominated in Canadian Dollars, the rate then applicable to
Canadian Prime Rate Loans), plus 2% (or, in the case of any such other amounts
that do not relate to a particular Facility, the rate then applicable to Base
Rate Loans under the U.S.$ Revolving Facility plus 2%), in each case, with
respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non-payment until
such amount is paid in full (after as well after as before judgment).

                  (e) Each Swingline Loan (which is not a Base Rate Loan or a
Canadian Prime Rate Loan) shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate agreed
to by the applicable Swingline Lender and the applicable Borrower.

                  (f) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section shall be payable from time to time on demand.

         2.15 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. (a) Except as otherwise set
forth on the Administrative Schedule, interest and fees payable pursuant hereto
shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed,
except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is
calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be
calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the
actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable
notify the Borrowers and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a
Eurocurrency Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a
change in the Base Rate, the Eurocurrency Rate or the Canadian Prime Rate shall
become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify
the Borrowers and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of
each such change in interest rate.

                  (b) Each determination of an interest rate or a Dollar
Equivalent amount by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders in
the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of
the applicable Borrower, deliver to such Borrower a statement showing the
quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate
pursuant to Section 2.14(a).

         2.16 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. If prior to the first day of
any Interest Period:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest
Period, or
<PAGE>
                                                                              35


                  (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that the
Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively
certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during
such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to
DASI and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice
is given (x) any Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant Facility requested to be
made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans,
(y) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on
the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency Loans shall be continued
as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant
Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest
Period, to Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the
Administrative Agent, no further Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant Facility
shall be made or continued as such, nor shall any Borrower have the right to
convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurocurrency Loans.

         2.17 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. (a) Each borrowing by any
Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by any Borrower on account of
any commitment fee and any reduction of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders
shall be made pro rata according to the respective Tranche C Term Percentages or
the applicable Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the relevant
Lenders.

                  (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower
on account of principal of and interest on the Tranche C Term Loans shall be
made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the
Tranche C Term Loans then held by the Tranche C Term Lenders. The amount of each
principal prepayment of the Tranche C Term Loans (i) made pursuant to Section
2.10 shall be applied to reduce the then remaining installments of the Tranche C
Term Loans pro rata based upon the respective then remaining principal amounts
thereof and (ii) made pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be applied to reduce the
then remaining installments of the Tranche C Term Loans in the order selected by
the Borrower. Amounts prepaid on account of the Tranche C Term Loans may not be
reborrowed.

                  (c) Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower
on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro
rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the U.S.$
Revolving Loans, Pounds Sterling Revolving Loans or Euro Revolving Loans, as
applicable, then held by the relevant Revolving Lenders.

                  (d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by any
Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or
otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior
to the Specified Payment Times on the due date thereof to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the relevant Lenders, at the Funding Office, in the
currency in which such amounts are denominated and in immediately available
funds (or, in the case of payments in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, in
same day or other similar funds satisfactory to the Administrative Agent). All
payments of principal, interest and letter of credit fees in respect of a Loan
or Letter of Credit denominated in any currency shall be made in such currency
except as otherwise expressly provided herein. All other payments to be made by
any Borrower hereunder shall be in U.S. Dollars. The Administrative Agent shall
distribute such payments to the relevant Lenders promptly upon receipt in like
funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the
Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any
payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment
into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any
<PAGE>
                                                                              36


extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension.

                  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified
in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the
amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is
making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the
Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with
interest thereon, at a rate equal to (i) in case of payments in U.S. Dollars,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (ii) in the case of a payment in Pounds
Sterling or Euro, the applicable Overnight Rate or (iii) in the case of a
payment in Canadian Dollars, the Bank of Canada Rate, in each case for the
period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any
Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such
borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent
will notify DASI of such failure to fund and the Administrative Agent shall also
be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum
applicable to the Loans comprising such borrowing, on demand, from the
applicable Borrower.

                  (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified
in writing by the applicable Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be
made by such Borrower hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment to
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower
is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be
required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant
Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such
payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by such Borrower within three
Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recover, on demand, from each relevant Lender to which any amount which was made
available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon
at the rate per annum equal to (i) in case of a payment in U.S. Dollars, the
daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate, (ii) in the case of a payment in
Pounds Sterling or Euro, the applicable Overnight Rate or (iii) in the case of a
payment in Canadian Dollars, the Bank of Canada Rate. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the
Borrowers. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date
shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder (if any) to make
a Loan on such Borrowing Date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on
any Borrowing Date.

                  (g) Any amount payable by the Administrative Agent to any
Lender under this Agreement in the currency of a Participating Member State
shall be paid in Euros.

                  (h) If, in relation to the currency of any Subsequent
Participant, the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this
Agreement with respect to such currency shall be inconsistent with any
convention or practice in the London Interbank Market for the basis of accrual
of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall
replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such
Subsequent Participant becomes a Participating Member State; provided, that if
any Loan in the currency of such Subsequent Participant is outstanding
immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect
to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

                  (i) Without prejudice and in addition to any method of
conversion or rounding prescribed by any EMU Legislation and (A) without
prejudice to the respective liabilities for indebtedness of any Borrowers to the
any Lender and any Lender to any Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement
and (B) without increasing the Revolving Commitment of any Lender:

                  (i) the Revolving Commitments and each reference in this
         Agreement to a minimum amount (or an integral multiple thereof) in a
         national currency denomination of a Subsequent Participant to be paid
         to or by the Administrative Agent shall, immediately upon such
         Subsequent Participant becoming a Participating Member State, be
         replaced by a reference to such reasonably comparable and convenient
         amount (or an integral multiple thereof) in the euro unit as the
         Administrative Agent may from time to time specify; and

                  (ii) except as expressly provided in this Section 2.17, each
         provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes
         of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time
         specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the adoption of the
         Euro in any Participating Member State and any relevant market
         conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

                  (j) The Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any party
to this Agreement in any way whatsoever for any delay (other than to the extent
caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Administrative Agent),
or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount
denominated in Euro, Pounds Sterling or Canadian Dollars.

                  (k) If the Administrative Agent at any time determines that:
(i) the Euro has ceased to be utilized as the basic accounting unit of the
European Community; (ii) for reasons affecting the market in Euros generally,
Euros are not freely traded between banks internationally; or (iii) it is
illegal, impossible or impracticable for payments to be made hereunder in Euro,
then the Agent may, in its discretion declare (such declaration to be binding on
all the parties hereto) that any payment made or to be made thereafter which,
but for this provision, would have been payable in the Euro shall be made in a
component currency of the Euro or Dollars (as selected by the Administrative
Agent (the "Selected Currency") and the amount to be so paid shall be calculated
on the basis of the equivalent of the Euro in the Selected Currency).

                  (l) Provisions of this Agreement relating to Euros and Pounds
Sterling shall be subject to such further changes as the Administrative Agent
may from time to time in its reasonable discretion notify to Dura and the
Lenders to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the changeover to the Euro in
the United Kingdom, if applicable.

         2.18 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW; ILLEGALITY. (a) If the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof
or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made
subsequent to the date hereof:

                  (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever
         with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application
         or any Eurocurrency Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of
         payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non- Excluded
         Taxes covered by Section 2.19 and changes in the rate of tax on the
         overall net income of such Lender);
<PAGE>
                                                                              38


                  (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
         advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other
         acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not
         otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate; or

                  (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount that such Lender reasonably deems to be material, of making,
converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans or issuing or
participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder
in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the applicable Borrower shall
promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If
any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this
paragraph, it shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.

                  (b) If any Lender shall reasonably have determined that the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy
or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or
any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of
Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy)
by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to
time, after submission by such Lender to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the applicable Borrower
shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.

                  (c) The applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long
as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the FRB to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including
Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities")
and, in respect of any Foreign Currency Loans or Loans made to a Borrower not
organized under the laws of the United States ("Foreign Borrower"), under any
applicable regulations of the Bank of Canada or other relevant Governmental
Authority in Canada (in the case of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars or
Loans to the Canadian Borrower) or the country in which the currency of such
Foreign Currency Loan circulates (in the case of other Foreign Currency Loans)
or of the European Central Bank (in the case of Foreign Currency Loans in
Euros), additional costs (excluding any costs in which such Lender receives
compensation pursuant to Section 2.18(d)) on the unpaid principal amount of each
Foreign Currency Loan and each Loan made to a Foreign Borrower equal to the
actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as
determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided the applicable Borrower shall have received at least 30 days' prior
written notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the amount of such
additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days
prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be
payable 30 days from receipt of such notice.

                  (d) Concurrently with each payment of interest on any Foreign
Currency Loan, the applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender the additional
costs referred to in Schedule 2.18 so long as

                                                                              39


such Lender shall be required to comply with the then existing requirements of
the Bank of England and/or the U.K. Financial Services Authority.

                  (e) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the applicable Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the
applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to
this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date
that such Lender notifies the applicable Borrower of such Lender's intention to
claim compensation therefor; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to
such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be
extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of
the Borrowers pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

                  (f) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Loans in any applicable currency as contemplated by this Agreement,
(a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurocurrency Loans, continue
Eurocurrency Loans as such, and convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans,
as applicable, shall forthwith be cancelled and (b) such Lender's Loans then
outstanding as Eurocurrency Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to
Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods
with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If
any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan occurs on a day which is not the last
day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the applicable
Borrower shall pay to such Specified Lender such amounts, if any, as may be
required pursuant to subsection 2.20. If circumstances subsequently change so
that any affected Lender shall determine that it is no longer so affected, such
Lender will promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, and upon receipt of such notice, the obligations of such Lender to make
or continue Eurocurrency Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency
Loans, as applicable, shall be reinstated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until
such notice has been withdrawn by the Lender (which the Lender agrees to do when
the circumstances that prompted the delivery of such notice no longer exist), if
a Base Rate is not available to the applicable Borrower, any Loans or
Obligations or other amounts due hereunder not subject to an Interest Period
determined prior to such notice shall bear interest at a rate reasonably
determined from time to time by the applicable Lender to be its cost of
maintaining its share of such Loans, specified Obligations or other amounts plus
the Applicable Margin and any applicable overdue percentage pursuant to
subsection 2.14(d).

         2.19 TAXES. (a) All payments made by any Borrower under this Agreement
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding
net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes)
imposed on any Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection
between such Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental
Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from such
Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or
received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges,
fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender
hereunder, the amounts so payable to such Agent or such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender (after
payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other
amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this
Agreement, provided, however, that the applicable Borrower shall not be


<PAGE>
                                                                              40


required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any
Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply
with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are
United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the
time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that
such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to
receive additional amounts from the applicable Borrower with respect to such
Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.


                  (b) In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay any Other
Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by any Borrower, as
promptly as possible thereafter the applicable Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant
Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt
received by such Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay
any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a
result of any such failure.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent and each Lender,
within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of
any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender, or by an Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") (other than the
Canadian Swingline Lender) shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related
participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender
claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or
881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement
substantially in the form of Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by
such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of,
U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrowers under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each
Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or,
in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases
the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such
forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously
delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify
the Borrowers at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to
provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrowers (or any other form
of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall
not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such
Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

                                                                              41


                  (e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
any Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party,
with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the applicable
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate,
provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver
such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or
submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.

                  (f) The Canadian Swingline Lender (A) certifies that it is not
a non-resident of Canada for the purposes of Part XIII of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) and that it is the sole beneficial owner of payments of principal of
and interest on its Canadian Swingline Loans under this Agreement; and (B)
undertakes to advise the Canadian Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any
changes in respect of clause (A) (provided that the Canadian Swingline Lender
shall not be required to notify the Canadian Borrower or the Administrative
Agent of any change resulting solely from the purchase of participating
interests in Canadian Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). In addition,
the Canadian Swingline Lender shall, promptly upon Canadian Borrower's or the
Administrative Agent's reasonable request to that effect, deliver to the
Canadian Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) such other
instruments in writing, forms or similar documentation as may be required from
time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation or the official
interpretation of law any rule, regulation or treaty by any Governmental
Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or
not having the force of law) in order to establish the Canadian Swingline
Lender's tax status for withholding purposes. If the Canadian Swingline Lender
receives a request from Revenue Canada Customs, Excise and Taxation or another
taxing authority to provide additional information concerning the withholding
tax status of the Canadian Swingline Lender, the Canadian Swingline Lender shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver such information to such taxing
authority, the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Borrower.

                  (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19,
no Lender shall be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.19 if
such Lender informs the Administrative Agent and DASI that it is not legally
permitted to deliver such form as a result of a change in any Requirement of Law
after the date of this Agreement.

                 (h) (i) The Borrowers will not be required to pay any
additional amount in respect of United States Federal tax pursuant to this
Section 2.19 to any Lender or to the Administrative Agent with respect to any
Lender:

                           (A) if the obligation to pay such additional amount
                  would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender to
                  comply with its obligations under Section 2.19(d); or

                           (B) if such Lender shall have delivered to DASI a
                  Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI in respect of its applicable Lending
                  Office pursuant to Section 2.19(d), and such Lender shall not
                  at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or
                  withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of
                  payments by the Borrowers hereunder for the account of such
                  Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United
                  States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of
                  such law or regulations by any Governmental Authority charged
                  with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or
                  not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of
                  such Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI.

                                                                              42


                  (ii)The Canadian Borrower will not be required to pay any
         additional amount in respect of Canadian federal income tax pursuant to
         this Section 2.19 to the Canadian Swingline Lender:

                           (A) if the obligation to pay such additional amount
                  would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender to
                  comply with its obligations under Section 2.19(f), (l), (m) or
                  (n) or Section 10.6; or

                           (B) if such Lender shall have delivered an instrument
                  in writing pursuant to Section 2.19(f), and such Lender shall
                  not at any time be entitled to exception from deduction or
                  withholding of Canadian federal income tax in respect of
                  payments by the Canadian Borrower hereunder for the account of
                  its applicable Lending Office for any reason other than a
                  change in the laws of Canada, its provinces or any political
                  subdivision thereof or any regulations promulgated thereunder
                  or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the official
                  interpretation of such laws, treaty or regulations by any
                  Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
                  administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
                  law) after the date of the delivery of said instrument.

                  (i) Each Revolving Lender represents to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent that, in the case of a Lender which is a Lender on the
Closing Date and, in the case of a Lender which becomes a Lender after the
Closing Date, on the date it becomes a Lender it is:

                           (A) either:

                                    (1) not resident in the United Kingdom for
                  United Kingdom tax purposes; or

                                    (2) a "bank" as defined in section 840A of
                  the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and resident in the
                  United Kingdom; and

                           (B) beneficially entitled to the principal and
                  interest payable by the Borrowers to it under this Agreement,

and shall forthwith notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent if either
representation ceases to be correct.

Each Lender that is not funding its Loans to the U.K. Borrower out of a Lending
Office in the United Kingdom (or another jurisdiction having an exemption from
United Kingdom income tax by treaty) shall submit a duly completed Form FD13
double tax treaty form to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (or the comparable
form for its jurisdiction to its jurisdiction's tax authorities) no later than
December 31, 2003 seeking exemption from United Kingdom income tax on interest
payable under the Loan Documents by the U.K. Borrowers.

                  (j) If the Canadian Swingline Lender is obliged to make a
deduction in respect of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes from any payment
to any other Lender in respect of such other Lender's participation in any
Canadian Swingline Loans, the Canadian Borrower shall pay the Canadian Swingline
Lender on the due date of the payment to the relevant Lender any additional
amount necessary (as determined by the Canadian Swingline Lender) to ensure that
the relevant Lender receives when due a net amount (after payment of any
Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes in respect of such additional amounts) in the
relevant currency equal to the full amount which it would have been entitled to
receive
<PAGE>
                                                                              43


from the Canadian Swingline Lender had a deduction not been made, and such
Canadian Borrower shall indemnify the Canadian Swingline Lender and each other
Lender on demand against all Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes.

                  (k) If any Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to
which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19, it
shall pay over such refund to the applicable Borrower (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this
Section 2.19 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise
to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or such Lender
and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the applicable Borrower,
upon the request of such Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid
over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such Lender in the event
Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any
Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information
relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other
Person.

                  (l) If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing Form W-8BEN
pursuant to Section 2.19(d) and such Lender grants a participation in all or
part of the Obligations of any Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to
notify the Administrative Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no
longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of such Borrower to such Lender. To
the extent of such percentage amount, the Administrative Agent will treat such
Lender's Form W-8BEN as no longer valid, and such Lender agrees to undertake
sole responsibility for complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed
by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

                  (m) If any Lender claiming exemption from United States
withholding tax by filing Form W-8ECI with the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 2.19(d) grants a participation in all or part of the Obligations of any
Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for
complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code.

                  (n) If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment
to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after
taking into account such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required
by Section 2.19(d) are not delivered to the Administrative Agent, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender not
providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the
applicable withholding tax.

                  (o) The agreements in this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

         2.20 INDEMNITY. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and
to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by any Borrower in making a
borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after such
Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by any Borrower in making any
prepayment of or conversion from Eurocurrency Loans after such Borrower has
given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c)
the making of a prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans on a day that is not the last
day of an

                                                                              44


Interest Period with respect thereto or (d) the increase of U.S.$ Revolving
Commitments on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period. Such
indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so
borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of
such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided
for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any)
over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that
would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurocurrency
market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted to the Borrowers by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         2.21 CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.18 or 2.19(a)
with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the applicable Borrower,
use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender)
to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with
the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such
designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause
such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect
or postpone any of the obligations of the applicable Borrower or the rights of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a).

         2.22 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. Each Borrower shall be permitted to
replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to
Section 2.18 or 2.19(a) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder, with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action
under Section 2.21 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts
owing pursuant to Section 2.18(a) or (b) or 2.19(a), (iv) the replacement
financial institution shall purchase, at par, including all accrued interest and
fees, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to
the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced
Lender under Section 2.20 if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced Lender
shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating
thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender,
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced
Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the applicable Borrower shall be
obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein),
(viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the applicable
Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section
2.18(a) or (b) or 2.19(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that any Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

         2.23 NOTICES TO AND FROM DURA. Any notice delivered by Dura on behalf
of a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2 or Section 3 shall be deemed to be
given by such Borrower. Any notice given by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender to Dura on behalf of a Borrower pursuant to this
Section 2 or Section 3 shall be deemed to have been given to such Borrower.

         2.24 UTILIZATION OF COMMITMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. (a) The
Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent amount with respect to
(i) any Borrowing comprised of Foreign Currency Loans as of the requested
Borrowing Date, (ii) any issuance of a Letter of Credit in a Foreign Currency as
of the requested issuance date, (iii) any drawing under a Letter of Credit
denominated in a



<PAGE>
                                                                              45


Foreign Currency as of the date of drawing, (iv) all outstanding Foreign
Currency Loans and L/C Obligations as of the last Business Day of any month (if
the Administrative Agent has not previously made a determination of the Dollar
Equivalent amount of all outstanding Foreign Currency Loans and L/C Obligations
during such month), and (v) any outstanding Foreign Currency Loan and L/C
Obligations as of any redenomination date pursuant to this Section 2.24 or
Section 2.16. or 2.18(f) and any date on which the Revolving Commitments are
reduced pursuant to Section 2.9.

                  (b) In the case of a proposed borrowing under a Revolving
Facility comprised of Foreign Currency Loans, the Lenders shall be under no
obligation to make Foreign Currency Loans in the requested Foreign Currency as
part of such borrowing if the Administrative Agent has received notice from the
Majority Facility Lenders under such Facility by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) four
Business Days prior to the day of such Borrowing that such Lenders cannot
provide Loans in the requested Foreign Currency, in which event the
Administrative Agent will promptly give notice to DASI that the borrowing in the
requested Foreign Currency is not then available, and notice thereof also will
be given promptly by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Lenders. If the
Administrative Agent shall have so notified DASI that any such borrowing in a
requested Foreign Currency is not then available, such Borrower may, by notice
to the Administrative Agent not later than 9:00 a.m. (New York time) three
Business Days prior to the requested date of such borrowing, withdraw the notice
of borrowing relating to such requested borrowing. If such Borrower does so
withdraw such notice of borrowing, the Borrowing requested therein shall not
occur and the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify each applicable
Lender. If such Borrower does not so withdraw such notice of borrowing, the
Administrative Agent will promptly so notify each applicable Lender and such
notice of borrowing shall be deemed to be a notice of borrowing that requests a
borrowing comprised of U.S. Dollar Loans in an aggregate amount approximately
equal to the amount of the originally requested borrowing as expressed in U.S.
Dollars; and in such notice by the Administrative Agent to each applicable
Lender the Administrative Agent will state such aggregate amount of such
borrowing in U.S. Dollars and such Lender's share thereof.

                  (c) In the case of a proposed continuation of Foreign Currency
Loans under a Revolving Facility for an additional Interest Period pursuant to
Section 2.12, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to continue such Foreign
Currency Loans if the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Majority
Facility Lenders under such Facility by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) four Business
Days prior to the day of such continuation that such Lenders cannot continue to
provide Loans in the relevant Foreign Currency, in which event the
Administrative Agent will promptly give notice to the applicable Borrower that
the continuation of such Foreign Currency Loans in the relevant Foreign Currency
is not then available, and notice thereof also will be given promptly by the
Administrative Agent to the applicable Lenders. If the Administrative Agent
shall have so notified such Borrower that any such continuation of Foreign
Currency Loans is not then available, any notice of continuation/conversion with
respect thereto shall be deemed withdrawn and such Foreign Currency Loans shall
be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period with respect to such Foreign
Currency Loans.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during
the existence and continuance of an Event of Default, upon the request of the
Majority Facility Lenders under a Revolving Facility, all or any part of any
outstanding Foreign Currency Loans under such Revolving Facility shall be
redenominated and converted into Base Rate Loans in U.S. Dollars with effect
from the last day of the Interest Period with respect to such Foreign Currency
Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify DASI and each Revolving
Lender of any request pursuant to the foregoing sentence.

         2.25 EVIDENCE OF DEBT. The Borrowers agree that, upon the request to
the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the relevant Borrower(s) will execute
and deliver to such Lender a Note of such Borrower(s) evidencing any Term Loans,
Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans, as the case may be, by




<PAGE>
                                                                              46


such Lender to such Borrower, with appropriate insertions as to date and
principal amount, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Borrower(s)
and the Administrative Agent.

                          SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT

                  3.1 L/C COMMITMENT. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other U.S.$
Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue Letters of Credit
for the account of any Borrower (other than the Canadian Borrower) (or, if a
Letter of Credit is for the account of a Subsidiary that is not a Borrower,
jointly for the account of a Borrower and such Subsidiary) on any Business Day
during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time
to time by such Issuing Lender; provided that (A) no Issuing Lender shall have
any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
issuance, (i) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would
be less than zero, (ii) in the case of a Letter of Credit to be issued in Euros,
(x) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans made in Euros,
together with all L/C Obligations in such currency, would exceed Euro 20,000,000
or (y) the aggregate L/C Obligations denominated in Euros would exceed Euro
5,000,000, and (B) Bank of America, N.A. shall have no obligation to issue any
Letter of Credit other than the Existing Letters of Credit that shall remain
outstanding until their respective expiration dates. Each Letter of Credit shall
(i) be denominated in U.S. Dollars or Euros, as selected by the applicable
Borrower, and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary
of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the
Revolving Termination Date, provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year
term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which
shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).

                  (b) No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue
any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing
Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable
Requirement of Law.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar
Equivalent amount of the L/C Obligations with respect to any Letter of Credit
when issued, when drawn upon and unless the Administrative Agent has previously
determined such Dollar Equivalent amount during such month, as of the last
Business Day of each month.

         3.2 PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF CREDIT. Any Borrower may from
time to time request that the applicable Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit
by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein
an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender,
and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the
Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender
will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers
and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its
customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested
thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any
Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the
Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers
and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of
Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the
Issuing Lender and the applicable Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a
copy of such Letter of Credit to the applicable Borrower promptly following the
issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the
Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders,
notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof).
<PAGE>
                                                                              47





         3.3 FEES AND OTHER CHARGES. (a) Each Borrower will pay a fee on all
outstanding Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower at a per
annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to
Eurocurrency Loans under the U.S.$ Revolving Facility on the undrawn and
unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, shared ratably among the U.S.$
Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date
after the issuance date. In addition, each Borrower shall pay to the respective
Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the
undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in
arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. All such fees shall be
payable in U.S. Dollars and, in the case of such fees with respect to any Letter
of Credit denominated in Euros, shall be calculated on the basis of the Dollar
Equivalent Amount of such Letter of Credit.

                  (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, each Borrower shall pay
or reimburse the respective Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs
and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing,
negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any
Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower.

                  (c) All amounts due under this Section 3.3 shall be payable in
U.S. Dollars.

         3.4 L/C PARTICIPATIONS. (a) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to
grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing
Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to
accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the respective Issuing
Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant's
own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's
Revolving Percentage in such Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and
in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by such
Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender
that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing
Lender is not reimbursed in full by the applicable Borrower in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to each Issuing
Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein
an amount equal to such L/C Participant's applicable Revolving Percentage of the
amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C
Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may
have against any Issuing Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default or an
Unmatured Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions
specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or
otherwise) of any Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or
(v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

                  (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant
to any Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed
portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is
paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such
payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand
an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) (A) in the case of
reimbursement in U.S. Dollars, the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate
and (B) in the case of reimbursement in Euros, the applicable Overnight Rate, in
each case during the period from and including the date such payment is required
to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing
Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that
elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such
amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is
not made available to the respective Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant
within three Business Days after the

<PAGE>
                                                                              48




date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from
such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated
from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the
U.S.$ Revolving Facility. A certificate of any Issuing Lender submitted to any
L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  (c) Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Lender has made
payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its
pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing
Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly
from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral
applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account
thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata
share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment
received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing
Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion
thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.

         3.5 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWERS. If any draft is paid
under any Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the
respective Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) the draft so paid and (b) any
taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender
in connection with such payment, not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time,
on (i) the Business Day that such Borrower receives notice of such draft, if
such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, or
(ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following
the day that such Borrower receives such notice. Each such payment shall be made
to the respective Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein
in the applicable currency and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be
payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid
until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until the Business Day next
succeeding the date of the relevant notice, Section 2.14(b) and (y) thereafter,
Section 2.14(d).

         3.6 OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. Each Borrower's obligations under this
Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances
and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that any
Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit or any other Person. Each Borrower also agrees with the
respective Issuing Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for,
and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be
affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of
any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be
invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and
any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter
of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against
any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing
Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or
omissions resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Issuing Lender. Each Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any
Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related
drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct, shall be binding on the applicable Borrower and shall not result in
any liability of the Issuing Lender to such Borrower.

         3.7 LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS. If any draft shall be presented for
payment under any Letter of Credit, the respective Issuing Lender shall promptly
notify the applicable Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The
responsibility of any Issuing Lender to the applicable Borrower in connection
with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in
addition to any payment obligation

<PAGE>

                                                                              49



expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that
the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in
connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such
Letter of Credit.

         3.8 APPLICATIONS. To the extent that any provision of any Application
related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.

                    SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this
Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of
Credit, DASI and each Borrower hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:

         4.1 FINANCIAL CONDITION. The audited consolidated balance sheets of
DASI and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year ended on such date
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of
DASI and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal year then
ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of DASI and its Subsidiaries as
at June 30, 2003, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income
and cash flows for the six-month period ended on such date, present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial condition of DASI and its
Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its consolidated cash flows for the six-month period then ended (subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the
related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise
expressly noted therein).

         4.2 NO CHANGE. Since December 31, 2002, there has been no development
or event that has had a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.3 EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each Loan Party and each of its
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and
authority, and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and
to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified
as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law except, in each case referred to in clauses (b), (c) and
(d), to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.4 POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Each Loan Party has
the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the
Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrowers, to
obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all necessary
organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrowers, to
authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. No material consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or
other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority is required in
connection with the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution,
delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered on
behalf of each Loan Party party thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and each
other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each Loan Party party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan
Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be

<PAGE>

                                                                              50



limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in
equity or at law).

         4.5 NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the
borrowings hereunder will not violate (i) any organizational or governing
documents of any Loan Party, (ii) any material Requirement of Law or (iii) any
material Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will not result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective
properties or revenues pursuant to any material Requirement of Law or any such
material Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Collateral
Documents).

         4.6 LITIGATION. Except as may exist with respect to matters
specifically disclosed in Schedule 4.6, no litigation, dispute or proceeding of
or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Loan Parties, threatened or contemplated by or against any
Group Member or against any of their respective properties (a) with respect to
any of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or (b) as to which there exists a reasonable likelihood of an adverse
determination, which determination would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         4.7 NO DEFAULT. No Group Member is in default under or with respect to
any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect that, individually or together
with all other such defaults, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, or that would, if such default had occurred after the Closing
Date, create an Event of Default under Section 8(e). No Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         4.8 OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Each Group Member has title in fee
simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property, and good
title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its other property necessary or
used in the ordinary conduct of its respective businesses, except for such
defects in title as could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the Closing Date, none of such property is subject to any
Lien except as permitted by Section 7.3. To secure the Obligations, the
Collateral Agent has a perfected, first priority security interest in all
Collateral (other than Excluded Property), subject to Liens permitted by Section
6.9 and Section 7.3.

         4.9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each Group Member owns, or is licensed to
use, all Intellectual Property reasonably necessary for the conduct of its
business as currently conducted except for those the failure to own or license
which individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expect to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. To the best knowledge of DASI and or any Borrower,
no material claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or
questioning the use of any Intellectual Property or the validity or
effectiveness of any Intellectual Property, except which infringement could,
individually or in the aggregate with all other such conflicts, not reasonably
be excepted to have a Material Adverse Effect. The use of Intellectual Property
by each Group Member does not infringe on the rights of any Person in any
material respect, except which infringement could, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such conflicts, not reasonably be excepted to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         4.10 TAXES. Each Group Member has filed or caused to be filed all
Federal, state and other material tax returns that are required to be filed and
has paid all material taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on
any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other material
taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any
Governmental Authority (other than any amount which is being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in
conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the relevant Group

                                                                              51




Member). There is no proposed tax assessment against any Group Member that
would, if made, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.11 ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien
in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The
present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on
those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual
valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed
made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued
benefits by a material amount. Neither any Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled
Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability
under ERISA, and neither any Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would
become subject to any material liability under ERISA if such Borrower or any
such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all
Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on
which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is
in Reorganization or Insolvent.

         4.12 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; OTHER REGULATIONS. No Loan Party is an
"investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. No Loan
Party is subject to regulation under any Requirement of Law (other than
Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

         4.13 SUBSIDIARIES. As of the Closing Date, (a) Schedule 4.13 sets forth
the name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary and, as to each
such Subsidiary, the percentage of each class of Capital Stock owned by any Loan
Party and (b) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights or other agreements or commitments (other than stock options granted to
employees or directors and directors' qualifying shares) of any nature relating
to any Capital Stock of any Borrower or any Subsidiary, except as created by the
Loan Documents.

         4.14 USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used to
finance acquisitions permitted under Section 7.8, to refinance debt to be
repaid, to provide working capital for DASI and its Subsidiaries and for general
corporate purposes not in contravention of any Requirement of Law or of any Loan
Documents.

         4.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.15, each
Loan Party and all of its respective properties and facilities have complied
with all applicable Environmental Laws except in any such case where the failure
to so comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have Material Adverse Effect.

         4.16 ACCURACY OF INFORMATION, ETC. To the best knowledge of each Loan
Party, all factual information heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or
on behalf of a Loan Party in writing to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (including the Schedules hereto) is, and all other such
factual information hereafter furnished in connection with this Agreement or any
other Loan Document by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Agent or any Lender
will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and as of the date of execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and such
information, to the best knowledge of each Loan Party, is not, or shall not be,
as the case may be, incomplete by omitting to state

<PAGE>

                                                                              52



any material fact necessary to make such information not misleading. All
projections prepared by or on behalf of any Loan Party contained in any
documents or materials furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Lender have
been prepared in good faith and represent such Loan Party's best estimates as of
the date of preparation of reasonably expected future performance, but actual
results may differ and such differences may be material.

         4.17 NO BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS. No Group Member is subject to any
restrictions in any Requirement of Law which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.18 INSURANCE. The properties of each Group Member are insured or
reinsured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, which are
not Affiliates of DASI, in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such
risks as are customarily carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and
owning similar properties in localities where such Group Member operates.

         4.19 SENIOR DEBT. The Obligations of each Loan Party constitutes Senior
Debt of such Loan Party under the 1999 Subordinated Indenture to the extent such
Loan Party is the issuer or a guarantor under the 1999 Subordinated Indenture.

        legal opinion of local counsel as may be required by the Administrative

Each such legal opinion shall cover such other matters incident to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably require.

         5.2 CONDITIONS TO EACH EXTENSION OF CREDIT. The agreement of each
Lender to make any extension of credit requested to be made by it on any date

                  (b) No Default. No Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date or after giving

Each borrowing by and issuance of a Letter of Credit on behalf of any Borrower

                        SECTION 6. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

                  DASI and each Borrower hereby jointly and severally agree

         6.4 MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE. (a) (i) Preserve, renew and

or the termination, Reorganization or Insolvency of, any Plan.

Each notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be accompanied by a statement of
a Responsible Officer setting forth details of the occurrence referred to
therein and stating what action the relevant Group Member proposes to take with
respect thereto.

         6.8 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Comply in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws, except for such noncompliance which in the
aggregate could not reasonably be excepted to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         6.9 ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, ETC. (a) Take promptly such actions, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, as the Collateral Agent or the Required
Lenders may from time to time reasonably request to establish and maintain
first-priority, perfected security interests in and Liens on all of their real
and personal property as collateral (subject to other Permitted Liens) pursuant
to the applicable Collateral Documents and to execute and deliver to the
Collateral Agent a Guaranty, in each case reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders, to secure and support the Obligations
(except to the extent otherwise expressly provided herein or in any Collateral
Document), including reaffirmations and, if appropriate, amendments of
Guaranties and Collateral Documents previously provided under the Existing
Credit Agreement, provided, that the granting of such Guaranty and/or Collateral
by any such Subsidiary does not create any material increased income tax
liability on the part of DASI and its Subsidiaries, and provided, further, that
the granting of such Guaranty and/or Collateral by any other non-U.S. Subsidiary
shall not be required prior to a request therefor to DASI from the Collateral
Agent or the Required Lenders; upon such request such Guaranty and/or Collateral

required under clause (a) of this Section 6.9, to cause each Person owning such
Material Subsidiary to pledge pursuant to Collateral Documents reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders 100% (or 65% if
such Person is not incorporated in the United States) of the shares of capital
stock or other ownership interests of such Material Subsidiary.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 6.9, no
Group Member will be required to grant a security interest in Excluded Property
and any Finance Subsidiary shall not be required to execute a Guaranty or grant
a security interest in its property to guaranty the Obligations.

                  (d) No Group Member will guarantee or otherwise become liable
for payment of Subordinated Indebtedness or the Senior Unsecured Notes unless
such Group Member shall have executed and delivered a Guaranty and applicable
Collateral Documents.

         6.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Comply in all material respects with all
material Requirements of Law of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over it or its business (including in respect of pension plans and the Federal
Fair Labor Standards Act), except such as may be contested in good faith or as
to which a bona fide dispute may exist or such noncompliance which in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         6.11 COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA. (i) Maintain each material Plan in
compliance with, in all material respects, the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code and other federal or state law, (ii) cause each material Plan which is

time, to ensure that (i) the Obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by each
Guarantor and (ii) the Obligations are secured by first priority perfected Liens
in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, on all
Collateral, subject only to Liens permitted under Section 7.3.

that, so long as the Revolving Commitments remain in effect, any Letter of
Credit remains outstanding or any Loan or other amount is owing to any Lender or
any Agent hereunder, unless the Required Lenders waive compliance in writing,

perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent by the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall not have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Collateral
Agent. The Collateral Agent shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i)
provided to the
<PAGE>
                                                                              71


Administrative Agent in this Section 9 with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the Collateral Agent in connection with its acting as
Collateral Agent as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent", as used in this
Section 9, included the Collateral Agent with respect to such acts or omissions
and (ii) as additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to the
Collateral Agent.

         9.2 COLLATERAL MATTERS. Each Agent is authorized on behalf of all the
Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the
Lenders, from time to time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or
the Collateral Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain a
perfected security interest in and Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to
the Loan Documents.

         9.3 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Each Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. Neither Agent shall be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.

         9.4 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither any Agent nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing have
resulted from its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct)
or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer
thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any
Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of
the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.

         9.5 RELIANCE BY AGENTS. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
DASI or the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by
such Agent. Each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Each Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement,
all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance
with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement,
all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the
Loans.

         9.6 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
unless such Agent has received notice from a Lender, DASI or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Event of Default or Unmatured Event
of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event
that the
<PAGE>
                                                                              72


Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agents shall take such action with respect to
such Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all
Lenders); provided, that unless and until the Agents shall have received such
directions, the Agents may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of
the Lenders.

         9.7 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS AND OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of DASI and its Subsidiaries, shall
be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any
Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of DASI and its Subsidiaries and made its own
decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except
for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to
the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent shall have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         9.8 INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its
capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by DASI or the Borrowers and
without limiting the obligation of DASI or the Borrowers to do so), ratably
according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the
date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if
indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Revolving Commitments
shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in
accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such
date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the
Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of, the Revolving Commitments, this Agreement, any of
the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein
or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action
taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from such Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive
the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         9.9 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Each Agent and its affiliates may
make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its
Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or
participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under
this
<PAGE>
                                                                              73


Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same
as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall
include each Agent in its individual capacity.

         9.10 SUCCESSOR AGENTS. Each Agent may resign as an Agent upon 30 days'
notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers. If an Agent shall resign as an Agent
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders
shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section
8(f) with respect to any Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be
subject to approval by the Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the
rights, powers and duties of each Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" or
"Collateral Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such
appointment and approval, and the former, Administrative Agent's or Collateral
Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any
other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the
parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has
accepted appointment as an Agent by the date that is 30 days following a
retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and
perform all of the duties of such Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as
the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any
retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was an Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, JPMorgan Chase Bank may not be removed
as the Administrative Agent at the request of the Required Lenders unless
JPMorgan Chase Bank or any Affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank shall also
simultaneously be replaced as "U.S. Swingline Lender," as "Canadian Swingline
Lender" and as "Issuing Lender" hereunder pursuant to documentation in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to JPMorgan Chase Bank.

         9.11 SYNDICATION AGENT. The Syndication Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.

                            SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. Neither this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or
modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The
Required Lenders and each Loan Party to the relevant Loan Document may, or, with
the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and each
Loan Party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time, (a) enter into
written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Loan
Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of
the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and
conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents or any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such
amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount or
extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, extend the scheduled
date of any amortization payment in respect of any Tranche C Term Loan, reduce
the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except (x) in
connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in
interest rates (which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Majority
Facility Lenders of each adversely affected Facility) and (y) that any amendment
or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this
Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for
purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment
thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's
Revolving Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Lender
directly
<PAGE>
                                                                              74


affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under
this Section 10.1 without the written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any
percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders, consent to the
assignment or transfer by any Borrower of any of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, release all or substantially
all of the Collateral or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from
their obligations under the Loan Documents, in each case without the written
consent of all Lenders; (iv) amend, modify or waive (x) any provision of Section
2.17(a) or 2.17(d) without the written consent of all Lenders or (y) any other
provision of Section 2.17 without the written consent of the Majority Facility
Lenders in respect of each Facility adversely affected thereby; (v) reduce the
percentage specified in the definition of Majority Facility Lenders with respect
to any Facility without the written consent of all Lenders under such Facility;
(vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 9 without the written
consent of each Agent and each Issuing Lender affected thereby; (vii) amend,
modify or waive any provision of Section 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 without the written
consent of the applicable Swingline Lender; (viii) amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 3 without the written consent of each Issuing Lender
directly affected thereby; (ix) amend, modify or waive any provision applicable
to the Collateral Agent without the written consent of the Collateral Agent, or
(x) amend or modify this Section 10.1 without the written consent of all
Lenders. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification
shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Loan
Parties, the Lenders, the Agents and all future holders of the Loans. In the
case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents shall be
restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, and any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default waived shall
be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default, or impair
any right consequent thereon.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended
(or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Agents and the Borrowers (a) to add one or more additional credit facilities to
this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time
outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to
share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with the Tranche C Term Loans and Revolving Extensions of Credit and the accrued
interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the
Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required
Lenders and Majority Facility Lenders; provided, that the approval of the
Supermajority Lenders (as defined below) shall be required if such additional
credit facilities, together with the outstanding U.S.$ Revolving Commitments and
outstanding Term Loans, would exceed $600,000,000 in the aggregate.
"Supermajority Lenders", as used herein, shall have the same meaning as
"Required Lenders" except that the percentage 51% used in "Required Lenders"
shall be deemed to be replaced by the percentage 66 2/3%.

                  In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may
be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers
and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans (as defined below)
to permit the refinancing of all outstanding Tranche C Term Loans ("Refinanced
Term Loans") with a replacement "C" term loan tranche hereunder ("Replacement
Term Loans"), provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such
Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such
Refinanced Term Loans, (b) the Applicable Margin for such Replacement Term Loans
shall not be higher than the Applicable Margin for such Refinanced Term Loans,
(c) the weighted average life to maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall
not be shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of such Refinanced
Term Loans at the time of such refinancing and (d) all other terms applicable to
such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially identical to, or less
favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those
applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to
provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the latest
final maturity of the Tranche C Term Loans in effect immediately prior to such
refinancing.

power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as

                                                                              77


counsel) to each Lender and of counsel to each Agent, (c) to pay, indemnify, and
hold each Lender and each Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing
fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in
paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined
to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation
or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment,
supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of,

neither DASI nor any Borrower shall have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such
Indemnified Liabilities to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent
permitted by applicable law, DASI and each Borrower agrees not to assert and to
cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of
recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities,
settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or
related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or

set forth in Section 10.2, or to such other Person or address as may be
hereafter designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative
Agent. The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         10.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS. (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
(including any affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of
Credit), except that (i) no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender
(and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent
shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.

                  (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph
(b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an
"Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitments and the Loans at the
time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

                           (A) DASI, provided that no consent of DASI shall be
                  required (x) for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a
                  Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined below) so long as, in
                  case of an assignment of any Revolving Commitment, such
                  assignment will

                                                                              78

                  not result in any increased costs to the Borrowers or (y) if
                  an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and


                           (B) the Administrative Agent, and, so long as Bank of
                  America, N.A. is an Issuing Lender, Bank of America, N.A.
                  provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent or such
                  Issuing Lender shall be required for an assignment of (x) any
                  Revolving Commitment under a Facility to an assignee that is a
                  Lender with a Revolving Commitment under the same Facility
                  immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment or (y)
                  all or any portion of a Tranche C Term Loan to a Lender, an
                  Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
         conditions:

                           (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender,
                  an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment
                  of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
                  Revolving Commitments under a Facility or Loans under any
                  Facility, the amount of the Revolving Commitments or Loans
                  under such Facility of the assigning Lender subject to each
                  such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
                  Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
                  Administrative Agent) shall not be less than U.S.$5,000,000
                  (or, in the case of the Tranche C Term Facility,
                  U.S.$1,000,000) unless each of DASI and the Administrative
                  Agent otherwise consent, provided that (1) no such consent of
                  DASI shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and
                  is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in
                  respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds,
                  if any;

                           (B) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
                  Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
                  U.S.$3,500;

                           (C) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative
                  questionnaire; and

                           (D) the Canadian Swingline Lender may not assign any
                  of its rights and obligations hereunder unless arrangements
                  satisfactory to Dura and the Administrative Agent have been
                  made for one or more Lenders to act (or cause their respective
                  affiliate to act) as Canadian Swingline Lender hereunder in
                  the full amount of the Canadian Swingline Commitment.

                  For the purposes of this Section 10.6, the term "Approved
Fund" has the following meaning:

                  "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person)
         that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank
         loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
         business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an
         Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity
         that administers or manages a Lender.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
         paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in
         each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party
         hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment

<PAGE>


                                                                              79


         and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
         Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
         the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released
         from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
         Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
         party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
         Sections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 10.5). Any assignment or transfer by a
         Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
         comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this
         Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
         and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
         agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of
         each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
         recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
         Revolving Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and L/C
         Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
         time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
         conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
         the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
         purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
         Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the
         Assignee's completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee
         shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation
         fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written
         consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section,
         the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
         and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
         assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it
         has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                 (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers,
DASI or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving
Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender
will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1
and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant shall be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
         greater payment under Section 2.18 or 2.19 than the applicable Lender
         would have been entitled to receive with respect to the


<PAGE>

                                                                              80


         participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
         participation to such Participant is made with the DASI's prior written
         consent. Any Participant that is a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
         entitled to the benefits of Section 2.19 unless such Participant
         complies with Section 2.19(d).

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

                  (e) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the
relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to
facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

                  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may
assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating
Lender without the consent of the Borrowers, DASI or the Administrative Agent
and without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 10.6(b). Each of
DASI, the Borrowers, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms
that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in
instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or
similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest
maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however,
that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save
and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense
arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit
Lender during such period of forbearance.

         10.7 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly provides for payments or collateral to be allocated to a particular
Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a
"Benefitted Lender") shall, at any time after the Loans and other amounts
payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable pursuant to Section
8, receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive
any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by
set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section
8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or
collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations
owing to such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from
the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations
owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the
benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted
Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with
each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

                  (b) The Dollar Equivalent amount of the principal of each
Loan, any L/C Obligations and any other amount payable by any Borrower shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent in the case of receipt by any Lender of
any payment or other recovery which may be subject to subsection 10.7(a) (or any
disgorgement by any Lender pursuant to the proviso to such subsection), as of
the date of such receipt (or such disgorgement).

                  (c) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to DASI
or any Borrower, any such notice being expressly




<PAGE>


                                                                              81


waived by DASI and each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon
any amount becoming due and payable by DASI or any Borrower hereunder (whether
at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and
appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other
credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the
account of DASI or any Borrower, as the case may be. Each Lender agrees promptly
to notify DASI and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and
application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

         10.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with Dura and the Administrative Agent.

         10.9 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         10.10 INTEGRATION. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the entire agreement of DASI, the Borrowers, the Agents and the
Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no
promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender
relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the other Loan Documents.

         10.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF

         10.12 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVERS. Each of DASI and the
Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

                  (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or

is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
New York, the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York,

                  (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought

venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or
proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same;

                  (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified
mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage

prepaid, to DASI or the applicable Borrower, as the case may be at its address
set forth in Section 10.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative
Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

                  (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

                  (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any
right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred
to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

         10.13 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. Each of DASI and the Borrowers hereby
acknowledges that:

                  (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

                  (b) neither any Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary
relationship with or duty to DASI or any Borrower arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the
relationship between the Agents and Lenders, on one hand, and DASI and the
Borrowers, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that
of debtor and creditor; and

                  (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan
Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby

         10.14 RELEASES OF GUARANTEES AND LIENS. (a) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, each of the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized
by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender except
as expressly required by Section 10.1) to take any action requested by any
Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or Guarantee Obligations
(i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any transaction not
prohibited by any Loan Document or that has been consented to in accordance with
Section 10.1 or (ii) under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) below
and the Collateral Agent. Without limitation of the foregoing the Lenders
irrevocably authorize each of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,
at its option and in its discretion, to release or, as the case may be,
subordinate any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent upon any Collateral (i) constituting property sold or to be
sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted
hereunder; (ii) constituting property in which a Loan Party owned no interest at
the time the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; (iii) constituting
property leased to a Loan Party under a lease which has expired or been
terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire
and which has not been, and is not intended by such Loan Party to be, renewed or
extended; (iv) consisting of an instrument evidencing Indebtedness or other debt
instrument, if the indebtedness evidenced thereby has been paid in full; or (v)
constituting property subject to a capital lease or purchase money security
interest permitted under Section 7.3(g) or (h). Upon request by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent at any time, the Lenders will
confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's and the Collateral Agent's
authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this
Section 10.14.

                  (b) At such time as the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations
and the other obligations under the Loan Documents (other than obligations under
or in respect of Swap Contracts) shall have been paid in full, the Revolving
Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be

                                                                              83


outstanding, the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created by the
Collateral Documents, and the Collateral Documents and all obligations (other
than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Administrative
Agent and each Loan Party under the Collateral Documents shall terminate, all
without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person.

                  (c) Each Lender agrees with and in favor of each other (which
agreement shall not be for the benefit of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party)
that any Borrower's obligation to such Lender under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents is not and shall not be secured by any real property collateral
now or hereafter acquired by such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries other than
the real property described in the Mortgages.

         10.15 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender
agrees to keep confidential all non-public information provided to it by any
Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement that is designated by the provider thereof as confidential;
provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any
Lender from disclosing any such information (a) to the Administrative Agent, any
other Lender or any affiliate thereof, (b) subject to an agreement to comply
with the provisions of this Section, to any actual or prospective Transferee or
any direct or indirect counterparty to any Swap Contract (or any professional
advisor to such counterparty), (c) to its employees, directors, agents,
attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors or those of any of its
affiliates, (d) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) in
response to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may
otherwise be required pursuant to any Requirement of Law, (f) if requested or
required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding, (g)
that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or any similar organization or any nationally recognized rating
agency that requires access to information about a Lender's investment portfolio
in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender, or (i) in
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan
Document. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party to this
Agreement (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party to this
Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind,
the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure. However, any such information relating to the tax treatment or tax
structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply
with any applicable federal or state securities laws.

         10.16 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. DASI, THE BORROWERS, THE AGENTS AND THE
LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND
FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

         10.17 ADDITIONAL BORROWERS. DASI may from time to time request in a
writing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that an additional
Subsidiary be added as an additional Borrower. If the Administrative Agent and
the Required Lenders consent in writing to such Subsidiary becoming an
additional Borrower (which consent may be given or withheld in the
Administrative Agent's and the Required Lenders' reasonable discretion, the
absence of any response by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
being deemed a rejection of such request), such Subsidiary may become an
additional Borrower by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a
Joinder Agreement and by delivering supporting documentation (including
certified organizational documents, authorization, incumbency and opinion(s) of
counsel) of the type and substantially in the forms delivered by the existing
Borrowers on the Closing Date and all in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.

         10.18 LIMITATION. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, (a) no Loan Party that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States of America (a "Foreign Loan Party") shall
be obligated in respect of any Obligations of any Loan Party that is organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction within the United States of America (a "U.S.
Loan Party") unless such U.S. Loan Party is an entity which is neither (i) a
"United States shareholder" (as defined in Section 951(b) of the Code) of such
Foreign Loan Party nor (ii) a corporation, 25% or more of the total combined
voting power of which is owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) by one
or more United States shareholders of such Foreign Loan Party in the aggregate,
and (b) any Foreign Loan Party shall only be obligated in respect of any other
Loan Party's Obligations to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law
of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Loan Party is organized (including
financial assistance limitations).

         10.19 JUDGMENT. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document
in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that
at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent
could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower
in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent hereunder or
under any other Loan Document shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency
(the "Judgment Currency") other than that in which such sum is denominated in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the "Agreement
Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following
receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the
Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal
banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.
If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum
originally due to the Administrative Agent in the Agreement Currency, the
applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any
such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such
obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency
so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent
in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any
excess to the applicable Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled
thereto under applicable law).

         10.20 AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT. The Loan Parties party to the Existing
Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents thereunder, the Lenders and the Agents
agree that, effective as of the initial Closing Date, this Agreement amends and
restates in its entirety the Existing Credit Agreement and this Agreement shall
not be deemed to be a novation of the Obligations (as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement) or any other obligations of any Loan Party under the other
Loan Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement). On the Closing
Date, the commitments of the Lenders shall be reallocated in accordance with the
terms hereof. To facilitate such reallocation, at the Closing Date, (i) all
loans and letters of credit outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement
shall be deemed to be Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder, (ii) subject to
Section 2.20, each Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such portions of
outstanding Loans (other than Swingline Loans and Tranche C Term Loans) and
participations in Letters of Credit under the Existing Credit Agreement of the
other Lenders so that each Lender holds such Lender's pro rata share in all
outstanding Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and participations under the
Existing Credit Agreement, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall apply funds
received from such Lenders as their initial extensions of credit under this
Agreement to the purchase of such interests, and (iv) the Borrowers shall select
new Interest Periods to apply to all Loans (other than Swingline Loans)
hereunder (or, to the extent the Borrowers fail to do so, such Loans shall
become Base Rate Loans).

         10.21 POST-CLOSING MATTERS. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
5.1 and 6.9, the Loan Parties need not complete the actions or deliver the
documents described in Sections 5.1(d) and 5.1(h) and

on Schedule 1.1(D) until the date which is 45 days following the Closing Date,
and the Closing Date will occur upon satisfaction of the other conditions in
Section 5.1.

                           ADMINISTRATIVE SCHEDULE TO
                                CREDIT AGREEMENT

I.   BASE RATES AND INTEREST PAYMENT DATES.

1.   U.S. Dollar Borrowings:

         "Base Rate" means for any day, a rate per annum (rounded upwards, if
         necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the greater of (a) the
         Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the Federal Funds Effective
         Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For purposes hereof: "Prime
         Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from
         time to time by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate in effect at
         its principal office in New York City; and "Federal Funds Effective
         Rate" shall mean, for any day, the weighted average of the rates on
         overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal
         Reserve System arranged by federal funds brokers, as published on the
         next succeeding Business Day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
         or, if such rate is not so published for any day which is a Business
         Day, the average of the quotations for the day of such transactions
         received by the Administrative Agent from three federal funds brokers
         of recognized standing selected by it. If for any reason the
         Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall
         be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable to ascertain the
         Federal Funds Effective Rate, or both, for any reason, including the
         inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient
         quotations in accordance with the terms thereof, the Base Rate shall be
         determined without regard to clause (b) of the first sentence of this
         definition, until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no
         longer exist. Any change in the Base Rate due to a change in the Prime
         Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the
         effective day of such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds
         Effective Rate, respectively.

2.   Pounds Sterling Borrowings:

         "Base Rate" means the rate that the Administrative Agent announces from
         time to time as its Base Rate, as in effect from time to time.

3.   Euro Borrowings:

         "Base Rate" means the rate that the Administrative Agent determines
         from time to time to be its cost of funds for obtaining the requested
         amount of Euro for the Interest Period, as in effect from time to time.

II.  EUROCURRENCY BASE RATES AND PERMITTED INTEREST PERIODS.

1.   U.S. Dollar Borrowings:

         "Eurocurrency Base Rate" with respect to each day during each Interest
         Period pertaining to a Eurocurrency Loan, the rate per annum determined
         on the basis of the rate for deposits in Dollars for a period equal to
         such Interest Period commencing on the first day of such Interest
         Period appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate screen as of 11:00 A.M.,
         London time, two Business Days prior to the beginning of such Interest
         Period. In the event that such rate does not appear on Page 3750 of the
         Telerate screen (or otherwise on such screen), the Eurocurrency Base
         Rate shall be determined by reference to such other comparable publicly
         available service for displaying


<PAGE>


                                                                               2

         eurodollar rates as may be selected by the JPMorgan Chase Bank or, in
         the absence of such availability, by reference to the rate at which
         JPMorgan is offered U.S. Dollar deposits at or about 11:00 A.M., New
         York City time, two Business Days prior to the beginning of such
         Interest Period in the interbank eurodollar market where its
         eurocurrency and foreign currency and exchange operations are then
         being conducted for delivery on the first day of such Interest Period
         for the number of days comprised therein.


2.   Pounds Sterling Borrowings:

         "Eurocurrency Base Rate" means with respect to each day during each
         Interest Period pertaining to a Loan, a rate per annum (rounded upward
         to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) equal to the sum of (a) LIBOR for such
         Interest Period and (b) the rate per annum calculated by the
         Administrative Agent in accordance with Schedule 1.1(B); "LIBOR" means
         in relation to any Interest Period, the rate per annum (rounded
         upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) quoted at or about
         11:00 a.m., London time, on the Quotation Date for such period on that
         page of the Telerate Screen which displays British Bankers Association
         Interest Settlement Rates for deposits in Pounds Sterling of the
         equivalent amount for such period (such page being currently 3750) or,
         if such page or such service shall cease to be available, such other
         page or such other service (as the case may be) for the purpose of
         displaying British Bankers Association Interest Settlement Rates for
         Pounds Sterling as the Administrative Agent, after consultation with
         the Lenders and the applicable Borrower, shall select provided that if
         no such rate is displayed for Pounds Sterling and the relevant period
         and the Administrative Agent has not selected an alternative service on
         which two or more such quotations are displayed, "LIBOR" shall mean the
         arithmetic mean (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100th
         of 1%) of the rates (as notified to the Administrative Agent) at which
         each of the Reference Banks was offering to prime banks in the London
         Interbank Market deposits in Pounds Sterling of such amount and for
         such period at or about 11:00 A.M., London time, on the Quotation Date
         for such period; "Reference Banks" means the principal London offices
         of JPMorgan Chase Bank and/or such other bank or banks as may from time
         to time be agreed between the Administrative Agent and the applicable
         Borrower; and "Quotation Date" means in relation to any period for
         which an interest rate is to be determined hereunder, the day on which
         quotations would ordinarily be given by prime banks in the London
         Interbank Market for deposits in the currency in relation to which such
         rate is to be determined for delivery on the first day of that period,
         provided that, if, for any such period, quotations would ordinarily be
         given on more than one date, the Quotation Date for that period shall
         be the last of those dates.

3.   Euro Borrowings:

         "Eurocurrency Base Rate" means with respect to each day during each
         Interest Period pertaining to a Eurocurrency Loan, the rate per annum
         equal to the sum of (a) the rate at which JPMorgan Chase Bank is
         offered Euro deposits at or about 10:00 A.M., London time, two Business
         Days prior to the beginning of such Interest Period in the interbank
         market where the foreign currency and exchange operations in respect of
         its Eurocurrency Loans are then being conducted for delivery on the
         first day of such Interest Period for the number of days comprised
         therein and in an amount comparable to the amount of its Eurocurrency
         Loan to be outstanding during such Interest Period and (b) the rate per
         annum calculated by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
         Schedule 1.1(B).
