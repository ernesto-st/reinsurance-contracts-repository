If an amendment of the Agreement is necessary in order for it to comply with Section 409A or Section 457A, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to amend the Agreement in a manner that preserves the original intent of the parties to the extent reasonably possible. No action or failure to act, pursuant to this Section 12.09 shall subject the Company to any claim, liability, or expense, and the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect the Executive from the obligation to pay any taxes, interest or penalties pursuant to Section 409A or Section 457A of the Code. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is deemed on the date of his &#8220;separation from service&#8221; (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) to be a &#8220;specified employee&#8221; within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then with regard to any payment that is required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code (after taking into account the applicable provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)), the portion, if any, of such payment so required to be delayed shall not be made prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of his &#8220;separation from service&#8221; or (ii) the date of his death (the &#8220;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Delay Period</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#8221;).
