least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date, a notice (which shall be deemed to
be a Borrowing Notice given by Borrower) requesting that each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment
make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to the Borrower on such Funding Date in an amount
equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Swing Line Loans (in each case,
the &#147;<B>Refunded Swing Line Loans</B>&#148;), each Revolving Loan Lender shall deposit in an account specified
by the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share of the amount so requested in same day funds and such
funds shall be applied by the Swing Line Lender to repay the Refunded Swing Line Loans. Anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1)&nbsp;the proceeds of such Revolving
Loans made by the Lenders other than the Swing Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by the
Administrative Agent to the Swing Line Lender (and not to the Borrower) and applied to repay a
corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line Loans and (2)&nbsp;on the day such Revolving Loans are
made, the Swing Line Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be
paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by Swing Line Lender to the Borrower in the amount
of the Dollar Equivalent of such Pro Rata Share, and such portion of the Swing Line Loans deemed to
be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be due under the
Swing Line Note of the Swing Line Lender but shall instead constitute part of the Swing Line
Lender&#146;s outstanding Revolving Loans to the Borrower and shall be due under the Revolving Loan Note
issued by the Borrower to the Swing Line Lender. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent and the Swing Line Lender to charge the Borrower&#146;s accounts with the Administrative Agent and
the Swing Line Lender (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately pay
the Swing Line Lender the amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans to the extent the proceeds of
such Revolving Loans made by Lenders holding Revolving Commitments, including the Revolving Loans
deemed to be made by the Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to repay in full the Refunded Swing
Line Loans. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to
the Swing Line Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the Swing Line
Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the

from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by

do not have knowledge of any material default that has occurred and is continuing thereunder, and
each such agreement constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of the applicable Loan

be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or

failure of such agreement to be in full force and effect could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Property, the material Easements thereto and the current use thereof
comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements and with all Insurance
Requirements. No taking or voluntary conveyance of all or part of any Property, or any interest
therein or right accruing thereto or use thereof, as the result of, or in settlement of, any
