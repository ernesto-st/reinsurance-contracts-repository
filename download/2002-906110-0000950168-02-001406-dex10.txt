         E.       Pursuant to the Original Agreement, the Lender established a
$375,000,000 Credit Facility, comprised of a $300,000,000 Base Facility in favor
all of the Owners and a $75,000,000 Revolving Facility in favor of the Property
Company.

         F.       Pursuant to the First Amendment to Multifamily Revolving
Facility Note dated as of June 21, 2000, the Revolving Facility was increased by

Company under this Agreement, the Notes and the Guaranties and the other Loan

Property Company and the REIT Sub have created the Collateral Pool in favor of
the Lender. The Collateral Pool is and shall be comprised of the following:

                  (1)      the Initial First Security Instruments;

                  (2)      the Initial Second Security Instruments; and

                           (which assignment shall secure only the obligations
                           of the Property Company under the Base Facility Note

                           Note.

         I.       Each of the Security Instruments shall be cross-defaulted
(i.e., a default under any Security Instrument, or under this Agreement, shall
constitute a default under each Security Instrument, and this Agreement), and
the Credit Facility shall be cross-collateralized (i.e., each second priority
Security Instrument shall secure a Guaranty (which Guaranty will guarantee all
of the TC Parties' obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
issued in connection with the Credit Facility)).

         J.       Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement, the Lender has agreed to establish the Credit Facility.

Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio for Advances Outstanding for the Trailing
12 Month Period is equal to or greater than 125%, the following provisions shall
apply at the Lender's option:

                  (a)     the Property Company shall pay principal amortization
         on the Revolving Facility Advances, payable on the first day of each
         calendar month (commencing with the calendar month following the
         calendar month in which the Property Company receives a notice from
         the Lender stating that the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio for
         the Advance Outstanding for the Trailing 12 Month Period is less than
         125%), in an amount equal to $600,000 per month; and

         Facility Credit Commitment shall each be reduced, as of the first day
         of each calendar month (commencing with the calendar month following
         the calendar month in which the Property Company receives a notice
         from the Lender stating that the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage
         Ratio for the Advance Outstanding for the Trailing 12 Month Period is
         less than 125%), in an amount equal to $600,000 per month.

If, on the date on which the Property Company pays the principal amortization,
no Revolving Facility Advances are then due and payable, the Lender shall hold
the payments in an interest-bearing account in a financial institution selected
by the Property Company and approved by the Lender, as additional Collateral
for the Credit Facility, until the next date on which Revolving Facility
Advances are due and payable, at which time the Lender shall apply the amounts,
including accrued interest, held by it to the amounts of the Revolving Facility
Advances due and payable. If, at any time during the period in which the
Property Company is paying principal amortization under this Section, there are
no Revolving Facility Advances Outstanding, the principal amortization shall be

                                      33

paid by the Borrowers and the Lender shall hold the payments in an
interest-bearing account in a financial institution selected by the Property
Company and approved by the Lender, as additional Collateral for the Credit
Facility, until the next maturity date of any Base Facility Advance, at which
time such amount shall be applied to the principal of the Base Facility Advance
to be repaid. If the Revolving Facility Credit Commitment is reduced pursuant

                                        -----------------
                  specified in Section 2.05(g)(4), on a form provided by

                                                          ------------------
                  Date") which the Borrower desires to consummate the
                  ----

                  Lender specifies: (i) which Mortgaged Properties the
                  Borrower proposes to be released, provided that any
                  Mortgaged Property securing only Base Facility Advances must
                  be among the Mortgaged Properties proposed to be released;

                  the Substitute Collateral and, if not, that U.S. Treasury

                  Securities will be the Substitute Collateral; (v) whether the
                  Successor Borrower will be designated by Lender or the
                  Borrower; and (vi) if a Fannie Mae Investment Security is
                  offered for use as the Substitute Collateral, the Defeasance
                  Notice shall also include the amount of the Defeasance
                  Commitment Fee.

                  Any applicable Defeasance Commitment Fee must be paid by the

                  time when Lender receives the Defeasance Notice from the
                  Borrower.

                           (2)      Confirmation. After Lender has confirmed
                                    ------------
                  that the Defeasance is then permitted as provided in Section
                  2.05(d), and has confirmed that the terms of the Defeasance
                  Notice are reasonably acceptable to Lender, Lender shall, with
                  reasonable promptness, notify the Borrower of such
                  confirmation by signing the Defeasance Notice, attaching the

                  Date and ending on the Stated Maturity Date (if a Fannie Mae
                  Investment Security is offered as Substitute Collateral) and
                  transmitting the signed Defeasance Notice to the Borrower
                  pursuant to Section 2.05(g)(4). If, after Lender has notified
                  the Borrower of its confirmation in accordance with the
                  foregoing, Lender does not receive the Defeasance Commitment
                  Fee within five (5) Business Days after the Defeasance Notice
                  Effective Date, then the Borrower's right to obtain Defeasance
                  pursuant to that Defeasance Notice shall terminate.

                           (3)      Substitute Collateral. On or before the

                  a pledge and security agreement, in form and substance
                  satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion (the "Pledge
                                                                      ------

                  ---------
                  interest in favor of Lender in substitute collateral
                  constituting an Investment Security (the "Substitute
                                                            ----------

                  Borrower's authorization and direction that all interest on,
                  principal of and other amounts payable with respect to the
                  Substitute Collateral shall be paid directly to Lender to be
                  applied to Mortgage Payments due under the Base Facility Note
                  subject to Defeasance. If the Substitute Collateral is issued
                  in a certificated form and the Borrower has possession of the
                  certificate, the certificate shall be endorsed (either on the
                  certificate or on a separate writing attached thereto) by the
                  Borrower as directed by Lender and delivered to Lender. If the
                  Substitute Collateral is issued in an uncertificated form, or
                  in a certificated form but the Borrower does not have
                  possession of the certificate, the Borrower shall execute and
                  deliver to Lender all documents and instruments required by
                  Lender to create in Lender's favor a first priority perfected
                  security interest in such Substitute Collateral, including a
                  securities account control agreement or any other instrument
                  or document required to perfect a security interest in each
                  Substitute Collateral.

                  before the Defeasance Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to
                  Lender an amount equal to the sum of:

                                            Properties to be released; and

                                    (C)     all reasonable costs and expenses
                                            incurred by Lender or Servicer in
                                            connection with the Defeasance,

                                            of Lender's or Servicer's legal
                                            counsel.

                           (6)      Defeasance Deposit. If a Fannie Mae
                                    ------------------
                  Investment Security will be the Substitute Collateral, then,
                  on or before 3:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time, on the
                  Defeasance Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay the Defeasance
                  Deposit (reduced by the Defeasance Commitment Fee) to Lender
                  to be used by Lender to purchase the Fannie Mae Investment
                  Security as the Borrower's agent.

                           (7)      Covenants, Representations and Warranties.
                                    -----------------------------------------
                  On the Defeasance Closing Date, all of the covenants of the TC
                  Parties set forth in this Agreement and all of the
                  representations and warranties of the TC Parties set forth in

                                    ----------------------------
                  result of the Defeasance, Lender determines that the
                  geographical diversification of the Collateral Pool is
                  compromised (whether or not the Geographical Diversification
                  Requirement is met), Lender may require that the Borrower add
                  or substitute Multifamily Residential Properties to the
                  Collateral Pool in a number and having a valuation required to
                  restore the Geographical Diversification of the Collateral
                  Pool to a level at least as diverse as before the Defeasance.

                  (b)      Closing Documents. The documents required to be

                  of them, when considered in combination and separately, are

                  Sections 2.05(a) and Section 2.05(e), Lender shall have the
                  right to retain the Defeasance Commitment Fee as liquidated
                  damages for the Borrower's default, as Lender's sole and
                  exclusive remedy, and, except as provided in Section
                  2.05(g)(2), the Borrower shall be released from all further
                  obligations under this Section 2.05. The Borrower acknowledges
                  that, from and after the date on which Lender has executed the
                  Defeasance Notice under Section 2.05(a)(2) and the Borrower
                  has delivered the Defeasance Commitment Fee, Lender will incur
                  financing costs in arranging and preparing for the purchase of
                  the Substitute Collateral and in arranging and preparing for
                  the release of the Mortgaged Properties from the lien of the
                  Security Instruments in reliance on the executed Defeasance
                  Notice. The Borrower agrees that the Defeasance Commitment Fee
                  represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into account
                  all circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement, of
                  the damages Lender will incur by reason of the Borrower's
                  default.

                           (2)      Third Party Costs. In the event that the
                                    -----------------

         SECTION 2.06      Cross-Default and Cross-Remedy. While each Note

represents a separate and independent obligation of each Borrower, the Borrowers
nevertheless agree that if any Borrower fails to pay fully, when due, any amount
payable under any Note or any other Loan Document, then the Lender may elect to
treat such default with respect to such Note or other Loan Document as being a
default under the Note, Guaranty and Security Instruments of each other
Borrower. It is a material part of the consideration for the Lender's execution
and delivery of this Agreement that there cannot occur an Event of Default with
respect to one TC Party or one Mortgaged Property or under one Note or other
Loan Document, without the occurrence of such Event of Default constituting, and
resulting in, an Event of Default with respect to all TC Parties, all Mortgaged
Properties, all Notes, this

Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Accordingly, the Borrowers expressly
agree that irrespective of the actual payments made by any of them under the
Notes, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, if the aggregate amount
actually paid is not sufficient to pay fully and timely all such Obligations,
then an Event of Default shall be deemed to exist as to all of the Loan
Documents of all TC Parties, notwithstanding that the amount paid was sufficient
to pay fully some but not all of the amounts then due and owing with respect to
the Notes or other Obligations. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to
prohibit one TC Party from paying or performing Obligations on behalf of another
TC Party or limit in any way the liability of any TC Party under this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents.

           SECTION 7.02.   Procedure for Obtaining Releases of Collateral.
                           ----------------------------------------------

                      SECTION 7.02(a) Request. In order to obtain a release of
                                      -------
           Collateral from the Collateral Pool, the Borrowers may, not more than
           once each calendar quarter, deliver a written request for the release
           of the Collateral from the Collateral Pool (the "Collateral Release

           Agreement. The Collateral Release Request shall not result in a
           termination of all or any part of the Credit Facility. The Borrowers
           may only terminate all or any part of the Credit Facility by
           delivering a Revolving Facility Termination Request or Credit
           Facility Termination Request pursuant to Articles IX or X. The

           Collateral Release Request shall not be effective unless it is
           accompanied by) the following:

                                      (i) The name, address and location of the
                      Mortgaged Property to be released from the Collateral Pool

                                     (ii) All documents, instruments and
                      certificates required to be delivered pursuant to the
                      conditions contained in Section 7.03.

                      SECTION 7.02(b) Closing. If all conditions contained in
                                      -------
           Section 7.03 are satisfied, the Lender shall cause the Collateral
           Release Property to be released from the Collateral Pool, on a
           Closing Date selected by the Lender, and occurring within 15 Business
           Days after the Lender's receipt of the Collateral Release Request and
           the satisfaction of all conditions contained in Section 7.03, by
           executing and delivering, and causing all applicable parties to
           execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and expense of the
           Borrowers, (i) instruments, in the form customarily used by the
           Lender for releases in the jurisdiction governing the perfection of
           the security interest being released, releasing the applicable
           Security Instrument as a Lien on the Collateral Release Property, and
           UCC-3 Termination Statements terminating the UCC-1 Financing
           Statements perfecting a Lien on the portion of the Collateral Release
           Property comprised of personal property and (ii) instruments
           releasing the Owner who owns the Collateral Release Property from its
           obligations under any Base Facility Note it has executed and the
           other Loan Documents (if, after giving effect to the release, the
           Owner will not own any Mortgaged Properties). If the Owner is to be
           released pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Property
           Company shall assume the

                                      50

           indebtedness evidenced by the Base Facility Note made by such Owner
           by executing an amendment to the Base Facility Note previously made
           by the Property Company, in a form approved by the Lender; provided,
           however, if the Borrowers add an Additional Mortgaged Property to the
           Collateral Pool in a transaction which is substantially
           contemporaneous with the release, then the Lender shall have the
           right to require the new Owner to assume the indebtedness evidenced
           by the Base Facility Note made by the Owner being released, by
           executing a novation, new Base Facility Note or other document in
           form and substance satisfactory to the Lender, and by granting for
           the benefit of the Lender a Security Instrument to secure its
           obligations with respect to such indebtedness. The documents and
           instruments referred to in the preceding two sentences are
           collectively referred to in this Article as the "Collateral Release

           released and(ii) the amount, if any, of Advances Outstanding which
           are required to be repaid so that (after giving effect to the
           transactions in this Section) the Aggregate Facility Debt Service
           Coverage Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period is not less than the
           Minimum Aggregate Facility Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
           Trailing 12 Month Period and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio for
           the Trailing 12 Month Period is not more than the Maximum Aggregate
           Loan to Value Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period, provided that
           if, after giving effect to the proposed Release, the remaining

           major thoroughfares to be conducive to continued good marketing,
           (iii) have a location which is not (A) inferior to other phases, (B)
           such that inadequate maintenance of other phases would have a
           significant negative impact on the phase, and (C) such that the phase
           is visible only after passing through the other phases of the project
           and (iv) comply with such other issues as are dictated by prudent

                  permitted under paragraph (2), it shall use reasonable
                  commercial efforts to obtain from the Institutional Lender a

                  Lender a simultaneous copy of the notice. The undertaking may
                  be conditioned on the receipt by the Institutional Lender of a
                  written confirmation by it and the Lender (which it and the
                  Lender hereby agree to give) that the failure of the
                  Institutional Lender to give such notices shall not (i)
                  constitute a default by the Institutional Lender under the
                  loan documents evidencing or otherwise relating to the
                  Indebtedness, (ii) give rise to any claim by it or the Lender
                  against the Institutional Lender or (iii) invalidate or
                  otherwise affect the efficacy of any notice given by the
                  Institutional Lender to it.

                           (1)      Except as otherwise provided in paragraph
                  (2) and Section 13.09, (i) TC-Oriole shall not Transfer any
                  Ownership Interests in the Operating Partnership, (ii) neither

                  Ownership Interests in any Owner, such Ownership Interests
                  having been previously assigned to the Lender pursuant to the

                  and approve all documents creating, perfecting and governing
                  the Lien, which approval shall be given if there is no
                  provision which, in the Lender's determination, will conflict
                  with, or cause a breach under, the provisions of this
                  Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Nothing in the
                  foregoing shall be deemed to permit, without the Lender's

                  in lieu of foreclosure) in connection with a foreclosure or
                  other disposition of the Lien (but such sale, assignment,

                  Recourse Transfer under Section 21.02).

                           (3)      With respect to the grant of a Lien which is
                  permitted under paragraph (2), the TC Party granting the Lien
                  shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain from the
                  Institutional Lender a written undertaking, for the benefit of
                  the Lender, that, in the event the Institutional Lender gives
                  the TC Party a notice, under the loan documents evidencing or
                  otherwise relating to the Indebtedness, which is in the nature
                  of a notice of default, a notice of acceleration of the
                  Indebtedness, a notice of foreclosure or a notice of the
                  commencement of the exercise of any other remedy against the
                  TC Party or the Ownership Interests, then the Institutional

                  confirmation by the TC Parties and the Lender (which the TC
                  Parties and the Lender hereby agree to give) that the
                  failure of the Institutional Lender to give such notices
                  shall not (i) constitute a default by the Institutional
                  Lender under the loan documents evidencing or otherwise
                  relating to the Indebtedness, (ii) give rise to any claim by
                  the TC Parties or the Lender against the Institutional
                  Lender or (iii) invalidate or otherwise affect the efficacy
                  of any notice given by the Institutional Lender to any TC
                  Party.

         more Requests (other than a Future Advance Request or a Credit Facility
         Termination Request) in a calendar quarter, they shall not make any
         further Requests (other than a Future Advance Request or a Credit
         Facility Termination Request) in the calendar quarter. The Property
         Company shall have the right, subject to the terms, conditions and
         limitations of this Agreement, to make a Future Advance Request for a
         Revolving Facility Advance on any day until the expiration of the

         for the Trailing 12 Month Period is not less than the Minimum Aggregate
         Facility Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period
         and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period
         is not greater than the Maximum Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio for the
         Trailing 12 Month Period, (ii) prepay Advances Outstanding in an amount
         sufficient to cause the Borrowers to be in compliance with the Minimum
         Aggregate Facility Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Trailing 12
         Month Period and the Maximum Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio for the
         Trailing 12 Month Period (to determine such compliance, as if the
         Maximum Credit Commitment is equal to the Advances Outstanding after
         giving effect to such prepayment), or (iii) reduce the Maximum Credit
         Commitment by an amount sufficient to cause the Borrowers to be in
         compliance with the Minimum Aggregate Facility Debt Service Coverage
         Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period and the Maximum Aggregate Loan
         to Value Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period pursuant to Article IX
         of this Agreement. In lieu of the foregoing, Lender may, in its sole
         discretion, permit the amount required to be prepaid to be paid in
         equal monthly installments during the period between the date on which
         such payment is to be made and the Credit Facility Termination Date.
         Any prepayments made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
         applied first against Revolving Advances Outstanding, then against the
         prepayment of Base Advances Outstanding, so long as the prepayment is
         permitted under the applicable

                                      87

<PAGE>

         Base Facility Note. If no prepayment is permitted under the
         applicable Base Facility Note, such prepayment amount shall
         be held by Lender (or its appointed collateral agent) as
         substitute cash collateral in accordance with a security
         agreement and other documents in form and substance
         acceptable to Lender. Any substitute cash collateral
         remaining will be returned to the Borrower on the earlier of
         the date when the Minimum Aggregate Facility Debt Service
         Coverage Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period and the
         Maximum Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio for the Trailing 12
         Month Period are again met or the Credit Facility
         Termination Date. If on the date the Borrower pays any
         amounts required by this Section, Revolving Advances are
         Outstanding but are not then due and payable, Lender shall
         hold such amounts (which amounts shall bear interest at a
         rate determined by Lender) as additional collateral until
         the next date the Revolving Advances are due and payable, at
         which time Lender shall apply the appropriate portion of
         such prepayment to such Revolving Advances.

         SECTION 13.08.   Covenants of the Lender.
                           ----------------------

                  SECTION 13.08(a)   Cap Rates. The Lender shall determine Cap
                                     ---------
         Rates for the Mortgaged Properties of the Owners approximately once
         each year. The Lender shall determine the Cap Rates on the basis of its
         internal survey and analysis of cap rates for comparable sales in the
         vicinity of the Mortgaged Property, with such adjustments as the Lender
         deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. In determining
         the Cap Rate, the Lender shall not be obligated to rely on any
         information provided by the TC Parties. The Lender shall have the right
         to select additional Cap Rates during the year at any time the Lender
         determines that changed market or property conditions warrant such
         action.

                  SECTION 13.08(b)   Valuations. The Lender shall perform a 12
                                     ----------
         Month Valuation for each of the Mortgaged Properties, and a
         determination of Aggregate Facility Debt Service Coverage Ratios and
         Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio for the Trailing 12 Month Period (all of
         which 12 Month Valuations and determinations shall be binding and
         conclusive on the TC Parties) once each calendar year, within 20
         Business Days after the Owners have delivered to the Lender the reports
         required in Section 13.01(b)(1) and (2). The Lender shall have the
         right to perform additional 12 Month Valuations and determinations at
         other times during the year (i) in connection with a Request, or (ii)
         at any time the Lender determines that changed market or property
         conditions warrant such action.

                  SECTION 13.08(c)   Notice to Other Institutional Lenders of
                                     ----------------------------------------
         the TC Parties. In the event a TC Party grants a Lien on any Ownership
         --------------
         Interests to an Institutional Lender which is permitted under Sections
         13.04(a)(2) or 13.06(a)(2), and the TC Party obtains the undertaking
         from the Institutional Lender described in Section 13.04(a)(3) or
         13.06(a)(3), then, within 30 days after the TC Party's request, the
         Lender will make a written undertaking, for the benefit of the
         Institutional Lender, that, in the event the Lender gives the TC Party
         a notice under the Loan Documents which is in the nature of a notice of
         default, a notice of acceleration of the Indebtedness, a notice of
         foreclosure or a notice of the commencement of the exercise of any
         other remedy against the TC Party or any of the Collateral, then the

                                      88

<PAGE>

         Lender shall also endeavor to give to the Institutional Lender a
         simultaneous copy of the notice. The undertaking may be conditioned
         upon the receipt by the Lender of a written confirmation by the TC
         Parties and the Institutional Lender that the failure of the Lender to
         give such notices shall not (i) constitute a default under the Loan
         Documents, (ii) give rise to any claim whatsoever by the TC Parties or
         the Institutional Lender against the Lender or (iii) invalidate or
         otherwise affect the efficacy of any notice given by the Lender to any
         TC Party.

         SECTION 13.08(d)   Insurance Claims Settlement.  Notwithstanding the
                            ---------------------------
provision of the second sentence of the third paragraph of Paragraph 5 of the
Uniform Provisions of the Security Instruments (as they provide on the date
hereof) relating to insurance claims, so long as (i) the casualty to a Mortgaged
Property has led to a claim of less than $500,000 and (ii) no Event of Default
then exists, the Lender shall not exercise the power of attorney granted
thereby, and an Owner may make proof of loss, adjust and compromise claims,
oppose and prosecute actions relating to the casualty insurance policy in
question and collect and receive the insurance proceeds in question.

         SECTION 13.09.  Covenant of the TC Parties Regarding Transfers.

                  (a)      Prohibition on Transfers.  Subject to paragraph (b)
                           ------------------------
of this Section  13.09,  the TC Parties shall not cause or permit a Transfer or
a Change of Control.

                  (b)      Permitted Transfers.  Notwithstanding  the
                           -------------------
provisions (a) of this Section 13.09, the following Transfers by the TC Parties
are permitted without the consent of the Lender:

                           (i)   A Transfer that occurs by inheritance, devise,
         or bequest or by operation of law upon the death of a natural person
         who is an owner of a Mortgaged Property or the owner of a direct or
         indirect ownership interest in the TC Parties.

                           (ii)   The grant of a leasehold interest in
         individual dwelling units in a Mortgaged Property for a term of two
         years or less and leases for commercial uses as long as commercial
         leases do not exceed 20 percent of the rentable space of the Mortgaged
         Property (measured as required by Lender) and provided that all such
         leasehold interests do not contain an option to purchase the Mortgaged
         Property; provided that in no event shall the TC Party grant a
         leasehold interest for a commercial use that permits pornographic or
         similarly immoral or inappropriate uses.

                           (iii)   A sale or other disposition of obsolete or
         worn out personal property which is contemporaneously replaced by
         comparable personal property of equal or greater value which is free
         and clear of liens, encumbrances and security interests other than
         those created by the Loan Documents.

                           (iv)   The creation of a mechanic's or materialmen's
         lien or judgment lien against a Mortgaged Property which is released of
         record or otherwise remedied to Lender's satisfaction within 30 days of
         the date of creation.

<PAGE>

                           (v)   The grant of an easement, if prior to the
         granting of the easement the TC Parties cause to be submitted to Lender
         all information required by Lender to evaluate the easement, and if
         Lender consents to such easement based upon Lender's determination that
         the easement will not materially affect the operation of the Mortgaged
         Property or Lender's interest in the Mortgaged Property and TC Parties
         pay to Lender, on demand, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
         Lender in connection with reviewing TC Parties' request. Lender shall
         not unreasonably withhold its consent to or withhold its agreement to
         subordinate the lien of a Security Instrument to (A) the grant of a
         utility easement serving a Mortgaged Property to a publicly operated
         utility, or (B) the grant of an easement related to expansion or
         widening of roadways, provided that any such easement is in form and
         substance reasonably acceptable to Lender and does not materially and
         adversely affect the access, use or marketability of a Mortgaged
         Property.

                           (vi)   The Transfer of shares of common stock,

         equity and other similar securities of the REIT or the Operating
         Partnership, and the subsequent Transfer of such securities; provided,

         Transfer, either upon such Transfer or upon the subsequent conversion
         to equity of such convertible debt or other securities.

                           (vii)   The Transfer of partnership or membership
         interests by the TC Parties, including, without limitation, the

         Parties to shares of common stock or other beneficial or ownership
         interests or other forms of securities in the REIT; provided, however,
         that no Change in Control occurs as the result of such Transfer and the
         general partner requirements set forth in the definition of "Change of
         Control" are met.

                           (viii)   The issuance by TC Parties of additional
         partnership units or convertible debt, equity and other similar
         securities, and the subsequent Transfer of such units or other

         securities.

                           (ix)     A merger with or acquisition of another
         entity by the TC Parties, provided that (A) the TC Parties are the
         surviving entity after such merger or acquisition, (B) no Change in
         Control occurs, and (C) such merger or acquisition does not result in
         an Event of Default, as such terms are defined in this Agreement.

                           (x)      A Transfer in connection with any
         substitution or release pursuant to the terms and conditions of Article
         VII of this Agreement.

         with a conversion of the type described in clause (v) of the definition
         of Transfer, provided that either or both of the

         the Ownership Interests of such transferee.

                           (xii)    The REIT, TC-Oriole or the Operating
         Partnership may merge with another Person if (a) the Lender consents to
         such merger or consolidation (which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld, delayed or conditioned; and provided that if the Lender does
         not disapprove of a proposed merger or consolidation on or before the
         Outside Review Date, the Lender shall be deemed to have given its
         consent to the merger or consolidation), or (b) if

                  (i)  either--

                           (A) it is the surviving entity; or

                           (B) it is not the surviving entity but either:

                                    (I) the surviving entity has a net worth,
                  determined by the Lender in accordance with GAAP, at least
                  equal to $500,000,000; or

                                    (II) the surviving entity has a market
                  capitalization,  as determined by the Lender, at least equal
                  to $650,000,000;

                  and

                  (ii) the surviving entity expressly acknowledges in writing

         at such time, or (ii) engaged in conduct relating to the conduct of its
         business such that Lender or Fannie Mae would not make or hold loans
         having such entity as an obligor.

                           (xii)    A Transfer permitted under Section 13.06.

                  (c)      Consent to Prohibited Transfers. Lender may, (except
                           -------------------------------
as provided in clause (xi) of paragraph (b) of this Section 13.09) in its sole
and absolute discretion, consent to a Transfer that would otherwise violate this
Section 13.09 if, prior to the Transfer, the TC Parties have satisfied each of
the following requirements:

                           (i)      the submission to Lender of all information
         required by Lender to make the determination  required by this Section

         of trust or deeds to secure debt on multifamily properties;

                           (iv)     in the case of a Transfer of direct or
         indirect ownership interests in TC Parties, if transferor or any other
         person has obligations under any Loan Documents, the execution by the

         of an assumption agreement that is acceptable to Lender and that, among
         other things, requires the transferee to perform all obligations of
         transferor or such person set forth in such Loan Document, and may
         require that the transferee comply with any provisions of this
         Instrument or any other Loan Document which previously may have been
         waived by Lender;

                           (v)      Lender's receipt of all of the following:

                                    (A)   except with respect to Transfers (i)
                  permitted under Section 13.06(f), (ii) in clause (xi) of

                  with a conversion of the type described in clause (v) of the
                  definition of Transfer, provided such Transfer is to one or
                  more Affiliates of a TC Party and provided further that the
                  Ownership Interests in such Affiliates are, directly or
                  indirectly, 100% owned by either or both of the REIT or the
                  Operating Partnership, a transfer fee equal to 1 percent of
                  the Advances Outstanding immediately prior to the transfer.

                                    (B)   In addition, TC Parties shall be
                  required to reimburse Lender for all of Lender's reasonable
                  out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
                  incurred in reviewing the Transfer request.

         provides to the contrary, any waiver so granted shall extend only to
         the specific event or occurrence which gave rise to the waiver and not
         to any other similar event or occurrence which occurs subsequent to the
         date of such waiver.

                  SECTION 17.01(d)  If any TC Party fails to perform the

         disbursement at the Blended Rate from time to time unless collection
         from the Borrowers of interest at such rate would be contrary to
         applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the
         highest rate which may be collected from the Borrowers under applicable
         law. Nothing contained in this paragraph (d) shall require the Lender
         to incur any expense or take any action hereunder.

not be obligated to perform the obligations of the Lender under this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents. The Lender, however, shall remain fully liable for
all of its obligations under this Agreement, notwithstanding the assignment of
its rights described under this Section.

         SECTION 18.03. Release of Collateral. The TC Parties hereby acknowledge
                        ---------------------
that, after the assignment of Loan Documents contemplated in Section 18.02, the
Lender shall not have the right or power to effect a release of any Collateral
pursuant to Articles VII or X. The TC Parties acknowledge that the Security
Instruments provide for the release of the Collateral under Articles VII and X.
Accordingly, the TC Parties shall not look to the Lender for performance of any
obligations set forth in Articles VII and X, but shall look solely to the party
secured by the Collateral to be released for such performance. The Lender
represents and warrants to the TC Parties that the party secured by the
Collateral shall be subject to the release provisions contained in Articles VII
and X by virtue of the release provisions in each Security Instrument.

         SECTION 18.04. Replacement of Lender. At the request of Fannie Mae, the
                        ---------------------
TC Parties and the Lender shall agree to the assumption by another lender
designated by Fannie Mae, of all of the obligations of the Lender under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and assignment of concomitant rights),
and/or any related servicing obligations, and, at Fannie Mae's option, the
concurrent release of the Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and/or any related servicing obligations, and shall
execute all releases, modifications and other documents which Fannie Mae
determines are necessary or desirable to effect such assumption.

         SECTION 18.05. Fannie Mae and Lender Fees and Expenses. The TC Parties
                        ---------------------------------------
agree that any provision providing for the payment by any one or more of the TC
Parties of fees, costs or expenses incurred or charged by the Lender pursuant to
this Agreement shall be deemed to provide for the payment by such TC Party or
Parties of all fees, costs and expenses incurred or charged by the Lender or
Fannie Mae in connection with the matter for which fees, costs or expenses are
payable.

         SECTION 18.06. Third-Party Beneficiary. The TC Parties hereby
                        -----------------------
acknowledge and agree that Fannie Mae is a third party beneficiary of all of the
representations, warranties and covenants made by any TC Parties to, and all
rights under this Agreement conferred upon, the Lender, and, by virtue of its
status as third-party beneficiary and/or assignee of the Lender's rights under
this Agreement, Fannie Mae shall have the right to enforce all of the provisions
of this Agreement against the TC Parties.

                         INSURANCE AND REAL ESTATE TAXES

         SECTION 19.01.   Insurance Escrow Fund.
                          ---------------------

         Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, no fund for
Insurance Premiums (a "Insurance Escrow Fund") shall be required to be
                       ---------------------
established with the Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that, in the
event the insurance deductible(s) of, or required in, any Insurance Policy
exceeds $100,000 (but after giving effect to any supplemental policy that covers
all or any portion of such deductible otherwise in excess of $100,000), the
Lender reserves the right to require the Owners to establish with the Lender, as
additional security for the Notes, an Insurance Escrow Fund equal to the
aggregate amount of the insurance deductible(s) on the Insurance Policy, as

                                      100

<PAGE>

reasonably determined by the Lender. If the Lender shall require an Insurance
Escrow Fund, it shall establish the Insurance Escrow Fund in a deposit account
with a financial institution selected by the Owners and approved by the Lender,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and
the amounts in the Insurance Escrow Fund shall be invested by the Lender in
Permitted Investments selected by the Lender. All earnings on such Permitted
Investments shall be added to, and become a part of, the Insurance Escrow Fund.

         SECTION 19.02.    Taxes.
                           -----

                  SECTION 19.02(a)  Escrow. A fund (the "Tax Escrow Fund")for
                                    ------               ---------------
         the aggregate amount of yearly water and sewer rates and taxes and
         assessments ("Real Estate Taxes") which may be levied on the Mortgaged
                       -----------------
         Properties shall be required to be established with the Lender
         pursuant to this Article XIX. The Lender shall establish the Tax
         Escrow Fund in a deposit account with a financial institution selected
         by the Owners and approved by the Lender, which approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the amounts in the
         Tax Escrow Fund shall be invested by the Lender in Permitted
         Investments selected by the Lender. All earnings on such Permitted
         Investments shall be added to, and become a part of, the Tax Escrow
         Fund.

                  SECTION 19.02(b)  Delivery of Letter of Credit. Provided that
                                    ----------------------------
         no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, at any time
         during the Term of this Agreement during which the Tax Escrow Fund is
         held by the Lender, the Owners may, upon notice to the Lender, elect to
         substitute for the Tax Escrow Fund a Letter of Credit (as defined
         below) in accordance with this subsection, in which event the Lender
         shall return the Tax Escrow Fund to the Owners within 30 days after the
         Owners deliver the Letter of Credit to the Lender. Provided that no
         Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, at any time
         during the Term of this Agreement during which a Letter of Credit for
         Real Estate Taxes is held by the Lender, the Owners may, upon notice to
         the Lender, elect to substitute for the Letter of Credit the Tax Escrow
         Fund, in which event the Owners shall deliver to the Lender, in cash,
         the amount of the Tax Escrow Fund which would have been required at the
         time of the substitution if the Owners had not elected to furnish the
         Letter of Credit and the Lender shall return the Letter of Credit to
         the Owners within 30 days after its receipt of the cash for the Tax
         Escrow Fund. Any Letter of Credit delivered to the Lender in accordance
         with this subsection shall be a clean, irrevocable Letter of Credit,
         naming the Lender as beneficiary, in an amount equal to the maximum
         aggregate amount which, at any point in time during the 12 month period
         immediately succeeding the date on which the Letter of Credit is
         delivered, would have been required to have been on deposit in the Tax
         Escrow Fund (the "Maximum Escrow Amount") if one had been maintained,
                           ---------------------
         as such amount is determined by the Lender. The Letter of Credit must
         be issued by an issuer (the "Issuer") that meets the Lender's
                                      ------
         requirements for ratings of issuers of acceptable Letters of Credit as
         set forth in the DUS Guide, must comply with all other requirements for
         letters of credit contained in the DUS Guide and must be a so-called
         "evergreen" letter of credit which does not expire unless the Issuer
         gives the Lender at least 30 days' advance written notice of the
         expiration. (The term "Letter of Credit" shall mean the letter of
                                ----------------
         credit delivered to the Lender pursuant to this

                                      101

         paragraph (b) in connection with the Lender's making the loans
         evidenced by the Notes to the Owners, any replacement letter of
         credit, and any amendment or renewal of the letter of credit or the
         replacement letter of credit.) If the Owners at any time provide a
         confirming letter of credit, a replacement confirming letter of credit
         or an amendment or renewal of the confirming letter of credit or the
         replacement confirming letter of credit, then the term "Letter of
         Credit" shall also mean the confirming letter of credit as so amended,
         renewed or replaced.)

                  SECTION 19.02(c)  Letter of Credit as Additional Collateral.
                                    -----------------------------------------
         The TC Parties agree that the Letter of Credit provides collateral for
         the Notes in addition to the lien of the Security Instruments on the
         Mortgaged Properties and, during the continuance of any Event of
         Default, the Lender shall be entitled to take any action permitted
         under this Agreement, in addition to pursuing any other remedy the
         Lender may have with respect to any other Collateral or secured
         property, including the Mortgaged Properties.

                  SECTION 19.02(d) Conditions for Providing and Holding Letter

                                          -----------------------------------
         Provide Letter of Credit. Until the earliest of (i) payment in full of
         ------------------------
         all sums secured by the Security Instruments and release by the Lender
         of the liens of the Security Instruments, or (ii) the date that the
         Lender fully draws on the Letter of Credit as permitted by this
         Agreement, the Owners shall renew, amend or replace the Letter of
         Credit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to ensure that
         the Letter of Credit remains in effect and does not expire.

                  SECTION 19.02(d)(2)     Return of the Letter of Credit or the
                                          -------------------------------------
         Proceeds Thereof. The Lender shall return the Letter of Credit, or the
         ----------------
         proceeds of any draws on such Letter of Credit (less all amounts which
         have been applied by the Lender pursuant to the terms of this Article
         XIX) to the Owners 10 days after the date on which the Lender releases
         the lien of the Security Instruments following payment in full of all
         amounts secured by the Security Instruments.

                  SECTION 19.02(d)(3)     Application for Prepayment. If the
                                          --------------------------
         proceeds of the Letter of Credit are applied to payment of a portion of
         the principal amount of the Notes, a prepayment premium attributable to
         such prepaid principal amount shall be due to the Lender and to the
         extent, if any, as provided in the Notes.

                                          ----------------------------------
         The Owners shall deliver to the Lender copies of the bills and notices
         of assessments for Real Estate Taxes for the Mortgaged Properties.
         Promptly upon the Owners' receipt of each yearly bill of Real Estate
         Taxes, the Owners shall deliver to the Lender an amendment or
         replacement of the Letter of Credit. In addition, not more than two
         times each calendar year, the Owners shall, promptly after receipt of
         notice from the Lender, deliver to the Lender an amendment or
         replacement of the Letter of Credit in the Maximum Escrow Amount for
         the then-current

         calendar year, as such yearly amount is reasonably estimated by Lender
         on the basis of assessments and bills and reasonable estimates thereof.

                                               ----------------------
                  30 days prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit,
                  the Owners shall either (i) cause the Letter of Credit to be
                  amended to extend its expiration date, or (ii) furnish a
                  replacement Letter of Credit. In either case, the amended
                  Letter of Credit or the replacement Letter of Credit must (A)
                  be in compliance with the requirements for letters of credit
                  under the DUS Guide, and be from an Issuer which meets the
                  Lender's requirements for ratings of issuers of acceptable
                  letters of credit as set forth in the DUS Guide, (B) have a
                  term not less than one (1) year (unless a shorter term is
                  approved in writing by the Lender), and (C) be in the amount
                  of the outstanding Letter of Credit, amended to the extent
                  required pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) above. The foregoing
                  shall not affect the requirement that, notwithstanding the
                  expiration date of the Letter of Credit, it will not expire
                  until the Issuer has given the Lender at least 30 days'
                  advance written notice.

                  shall review the rating of the Issuer of the then outstanding
                  Letter of Credit. If the Lender notifies the Owners that at
                  the time of any such review the issuing bank does not meet the
                  Lender's requirements for ratings of issuers of acceptable
                  letters of credit as set forth in the DUS Guide, the Owners
                  shall replace the outstanding Letter of Credit with a Letter
                  of Credit that complies with all of the requirements set forth
                  in the DUS Guide, no later than 30 days after the Lender's
                  notice to the Owners, unless the outstanding Letter of Credit
                  would expire prior to such 30-day period, in which case the
                  Owners shall provide the replacement Letter of Credit no later
                  than five business days prior to the expiration date of the
                  outstanding Letter of Credit.

                  (2) above, as the case may be, which amended or replacement
                  Letter of Credit satisfies all of the requirements of
                  paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Lender shall draw the full
                  amount of the Letter of Credit and hold and apply the proceeds
                  as permitted hereunder and, in such event, no Event of Default

In the event an Insurance Escrow Fund or a Tax Escrow Fund is required under the
terms of this Article XIX, the following provisions shall apply:

                  SECTION 19.03(a) Deposits. Subject to applicable law, the
                                   --------
         Owners shall pay to the Lender on the first day of each calendar month
         (or on another day designated in writing by the Lender), until the

         levied on the Mortgaged Properties and (2) if an Insurance Escrow Fund
         is required, the Insurance Premiums or insurance deductibles (either,
         an "Insurance Payment"), whichever is required by the Loan Documents.
             -----------------
         The Lender may require the Owners to pay to the Lender, in advance,
         such other Funds for other taxes, charges, premiums, assessments and
         impositions in connection with the Owners or the Mortgaged Properties
         to the extent such taxes, charges, premiums, assessments or impositions
         constitute an encumbrance on a Mortgaged Property with priority over
         the Security Instruments on the Mortgaged Property (herein "Other
                                                                     -----

         may require Funds for Other Impositions to be paid by the Owners in a
         lump sum or in periodic installments, at the Lender's option.

                  SECTION 19.03(b) Application of Funds. The Lender shall apply

         the Funds to pay the Real Estate Taxes, Insurance Premiums or Other
         Impositions, as the case may be, so long as no Event of Default has
         occurred. The Lender shall make no charge for so holding and applying
         the Funds, analyzing said account or for verifying and compiling said
         assessments and bills, unless the Lender pays the Owners interest,
         earnings or profits on the Funds and applicable law permits the Lender
         to make such a charge. The Lender shall give to the Owners, without
         charge, an annual accounting of the Funds in the Lender's normal format
         showing credits and debits to the Funds and the purpose for which each
         debit to the Funds was made. The Funds are pledged as additional
         security for the sums secured by the Security Instruments.

                  SECTION 19.03(c) Adjustment of Amount of Funds. If the amount
                                   -----------------------------
         of the Funds held in the Tax Escrow Fund and the Insurance Escrow Fund
         at the time of the annual accounting thereof shall exceed the amount
         deemed necessary by the Lender to provide for the payment of any
         Insurance Premiums (if an Insurance Escrow Fund is required), Real
         Estate Taxes (if a Tax Escrow Fund is required) and Other Impositions
         (if either an Insurance Escrow Fund or a Tax Escrow Fund is required),
         as they fall due, such excess shall be credited to the Owners on the
         next monthly installment or installments of Funds due. If at any time
         the amount of the Funds held in the Tax Escrow Fund and the Insurance
         Escrow Fund shall be less than the amount deemed necessary by the
         Lender to pay such Insurance

         (if a Tax Escrow Fund is required) and Other Impositions (if either an
         Insurance Escrow Fund or a Tax Escrow Fund is required) , as they fall
         due, the Owners shall pay to the Lender any amount necessary to make
         up the deficiency within 30 days after notice from the Lender to the
         Owners requesting payment thereof.

                  SECTION 19.03(d) Return of Funds. Upon payment in full of all

         the Owners any Funds held by the Lender.

amend one or more Caps to provide for a decrease in the notional amount to an
amount equal to the Revolving Facility Credit Commitment, provided that the

the Property Company and reasonably satisfactory to the Lender and shall be
invested by the Lender in Permitted Investments selected by the Lender. All
earnings on such Permitted Investments shall be added to, and become a part of,
the Cap Escrow Fund. The Property Company hereby pledges and assigns to the
Lender, and grants a lien and security interest in, and right of setoff against,
any right, title and interest it may have in and to the Cap Escrow Fund. At the
Lender's request, the Property Company shall cause the financial institution
holding the Cap Escrow Fund to execute and deliver a Restricted Account Letter
in form and substance similar to that signed with respect to the pledged account
maintained under the Cap Security Agreement. In lieu of the Cap Escrow Fund, the
Property Company may deliver to the Lender an irrevocable Letter of Credit
meeting all of the terms set forth in Section 19.02(b)-(f), except that the
amount of the Letter of Credit during each Cap Year shall at all times be equal
to the amount which would otherwise have been required to be in the Cap Escrow
Fund at the end of such Cap Year, and the Property Company shall deliver a new
Letter of Credit (or an amendment to the existing Letter of Credit) on or before
the first day of each Cap Year, amending the amount of the Letter of Credit.
Provided no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has then occurred and
is continuing, the Letter of Credit or Cap Escrow Fund shall be returned to the
Property Company within 30 days after the date on which the Property Company
obtains the Final Cap and delivers the Final Cap to the Lender or its designee.

partner or holder personally, and (B) to the extent of distributions
or other amounts received by such limited partner or holder which, as
a matter of federal or applicable state law, constitute a fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer.
