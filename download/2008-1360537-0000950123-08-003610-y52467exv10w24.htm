requests upon receiving notice or knowledge of: (i)&nbsp;any Policy claim or loss in excess of Two

insured&#146;s liability for the claim or loss, Manager&#146;s analysis of damages resulting from the claim
or loss and Manager&#146;s analysis of the applicability of coverage for the claim or loss. These

Agreement, Manager shall submit to Company for approval a list of the attorneys and loss adjusters
it intends to use. Such list shall be considered approved unless Company objects to any of such

Manager shall promptly furnish Company, or its designee, any additional claim or loss information
requested by Company with respect to a claim or loss pertaining to any Policy covered by this
Agreement, and it is further agreed with respect to any claim or loss of any amount as follows:
