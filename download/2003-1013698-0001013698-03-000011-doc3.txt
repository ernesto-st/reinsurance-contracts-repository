                 SUPERIOR INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED
                              INSURANCE SUBSIDARIES
                         (HEREAFTER CALLED THE "COMPANY"

                                       AND

                    NATIONAL UNION FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY OF
                                 PITTSBURGH, PA.
                       (HEREAFTER CALLED THE "REINSURER")


It  is  understood  and  agreed  that  effective January 1st, 2002 the following
articles  are  amended  to  read  as  follows:

               ARTICLE II                    TERM AND TERMINATION
               ----------                    --------------------

The agreement commences at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, January 1, 2000 and
shall remain in force until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard time, December 31, 2002.
Either  party  may  terminate effective on the first day of any calendar quarter
with 60 days advance written notice.  The Reinsurer shall remain liable for loss
under  reinsured  policies  effective  prior  to  the  termination  date.

             ARTICLE IV                    QUOTA SHARE PARTICIPATION
             ----------                    -------------------------

The  aggregate  quota  share  cession  shall be at the option of the Company and
subject  to  a  maximum of 70%.  However, the maximum cession will be limited to
$80,000,000  of  new  written  premium  (ie.not  including in-force cession from
December  31st,  2001)  for  the calendar year 2002.  In the event this produces
more than $80,000,000 for the calendar year, the dollar amount of cessions shall
be  reduced  to  $80,000,000 plus the cession of in-force business from December
31st,  2001. The average quota share percent applicable for the Company shall be
the  ratio  of  the adjusted dollar cession to the gross subject written premium
for  the  Company  for  that  year.  Each  quarter shall be adjusted by an equal
pro-rata  percent  to  produce the dollar cession applicable.  This limit can be
increased by mutual agreement between the Reinsurer and the Company. The Company
shall  notify the Reinsurer prior to the last day of the calendar quarter of the
quota  share  percent  for  that quarter.   That percent shall also apply to the
in-force  business  at  the  beginning  of  the  quarter.  It is agreed that the
cession  for any one quarter, including the change in in-force, shall not exceed
35%  of  the  total  cession  for  the calendar year.  In the event the declared
percent cession for a calendar quarter produces premiums in excess of 35% of the
premium  ceded  for  the  calendar  year  the cessions for that quarter shall be
adjusted  to the dollar amount that would equal 35% of the premium ceded for the
year.

The  Reinsurer's  liability  for  aggregate  losses,  including  allocated  loss
adjustment  expenses  (and
unallocated  loss  adjustment  expenses  where  applicable  under  REPORTS  AND
ACOCUNTING),
shall  be  limited  to 97% of earned premium ceded for all business from January
1st,  2002  to  the  calculation  date.

the  beginning  of  the  quarter as the result of a change in the percent ceded.
The  Reinsurer  shall  allow  the  company  a  minimum  and  provisional  ceding
commission  of  18%  on  such premium.  The ceding commission slides 1 for 1 for
