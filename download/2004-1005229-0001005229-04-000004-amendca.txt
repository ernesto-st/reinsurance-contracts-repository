                  (f) The  provisions  of this  Section  1.5  are  made  for the
         benefit of the Lenders and their  successors  and  assigns,  and may be
         enforced in good faith by them from time to time  against any or all of
         the Credit  Parties  as often as the  occasion  therefor  may arise and
         without  requirement  on the part of the Lender first to marshal any of
         their  claims or to  exercise  any of their  rights  against  any other
         Credit Party or to exhaust any  remedies  available to them against any
         other  Credit  Party  or to  resort  to any  other  source  or means of
         obtaining  payment of any of the Obligations  hereunder or to elect any
         other remedy. The provisions of this Section 1.5 shall remain in effect
         until all of the Obligations  shall have been paid in full or otherwise
         fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made
         in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be
         restored or returned by the Lenders upon the insolvency,  bankruptcy or
         reorganization  of  any  of  the  Credit  Parties,  or  otherwise,  the
         provisions of this Section 1.5 will  forthwith be reinstated in effect,
         as though such payment had not been made.

                  (g)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other  provision of
         this  Agreement,  it is  expressly  agreed  that the joint and  several
         liability of any Canadian  Borrower  hereunder and under the other Loan
         Documents shall be limited to the Obligations of the Canadian Borrowers
         and no Canadian  Borrower shall otherwise be liable for the Obligations
         of any other  Credit  Party  hereunder  other  than the other  Canadian
         Borrower.

                  (h) Any notice, request, waiver, consent or other action made,
         given or taken by any Credit Party shall bind all Credit Parties.

                  (i) Each Credit Party hereby authorizes each of the Designated
         Financial  Officers  listed in SCHEDULE  1.5 hereto to act as agent for
         each  Credit  Party and to execute and deliver on behalf of each Credit
         Party such notices, requests, waivers, consents, certificates and other
         documents,  and to take any and all actions required or permitted to be
         delivered  or taken by any Credit  Party  hereunder.  The  Borrower may
         replace any of the Designated Financial Officers listed in SCHEDULE 1.5
         hereto  or  add  any  additional   Designated   Financial  Officers  by
         delivering written notice to the Agent specifying the names of each new
         Designated  Financial Officer and the offices held by each such Person.
         Each  Credit  Party  hereby  agrees  that any such  notices,  requests,
         waivers, consents, certificates and other documents executed, delivered
         or sent by any  Designated  Financial  Officer of the  Borrower and any
         such actions taken by any Designated  Financial Officer of the Borrower
         shall bind each Credit Party.

         2.1.  REVOLVING LOANS.

                  (a)  REVOLVING  CREDIT  COMMITMENTS.  Subject to the terms and
         conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans


                                       45

<PAGE>

         to  the  Borrower  from  time  to  time  during  the  Revolving  Credit
         Availability  Period in an  aggregate  principal  amount  that will not
         result in such Lender's  Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding the lesser
         of (i) such Lender's  Revolving Credit Commitment at such time and (ii)
         an amount equal to such  Lender's  Applicable  Percentage of the sum of
         the (A)  Domestic  Borrowing  Base at such time  PLUS (B) the  Canadian
         Borrowing  Amount at such time;  PROVIDED  that the Domestic  Revolving
         Credit  Exposure plus the Canadian  Excess Amount shall not at any time
         exceed the Domestic Gross Availability. Within the foregoing limits and
         subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,  the Borrower may
         borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

                  (b) FUNDING OF REVOLVING  LOANS. To request the funding of any
         Revolving Loan  hereunder,  the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, an
         Advance  Request in  substantially  the form of Exhibit B-4 hereto,  by
         facsimile or electronic  mail  transmission,  not later than 1:00 p.m.,
         Boston,  Massachusetts  time,  (i) two (2)  Business  Days prior to the
         proposed  Drawdown  Date of any Base Rate Loan and (ii) three (3) LIBOR
         Business  Days prior to the  proposed  Drawdown  Date of any LIBOR Rate
         Loan.  Each such request shall specify (i) the principal  amount of the
         Revolving  Loan  requested,  (ii) the  proposed  Drawdown  Date of such
         Revolving Loan, (ii) the Interest Period for such Revolving Loan, (iii)
         the  Type  of  such   Revolving   Loan  and  (iv)  the  Domestic  Gross
         Availability  as  set  forth  in  the  most  recent  Collateral  Update
         Certificate/Borrowing  Base Certificate  delivered to Lender.  Promptly
         following  receipt  of an  Advance  Request  in  compliance  with  this
         subsection  2.1(b),  the Agent shall  advise each Lender of the details
         thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan to be made as
         part of the requested Borrowing,  and PROVIDED that no Default or Event
         of Default  shall  have  occurred  and be  continuing  or shall  result
         therefrom,  on the date such Advance Request is delivered to the Agent,
         the Lenders  shall make a Revolving  Loan to the Borrower in accordance
         with the terms of  Section  2.5 in an amount  equal to the  amount  set
         forth in such  Advance  Request.  Each  Advance  Request  shall be in a
         minimum  aggregate  amount of  $1,000,000  or an  integral  multiple of
         $100,000 in excess thereof.

                  (c) INTEREST ON REVOLVING LOANS.

                           (i) Subject to clause (iv) of this subsection 2.1(d),
                  each  Revolving  Loan  which is a Base  Rate Loan  shall  bear
                  interest  for the period  commencing  with the  Drawdown  Date
                  thereof and ending on the last day of the calendar  month with
                  respect  thereto at the rate per annum  equal to the Base Rate
                  plus the Applicable  Margin with respect to Base Rate Loans as
                  in effect from time to time.

                           (ii)  Subject  to  clause  (iv)  of  this  subsection
                  2.1(d),  each  Revolving Loan which is a LIBOR Rate Loan shall
                  bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date
                  thereof and ending on the last day of the LIBOR Rate  Interest
                  Period  with  respect  thereto  at the rate equal to the LIBOR


                                       46

<PAGE>

                  Rate  determined for such LIBOR Rate Interest  Period PLUS the
                  Applicable  Margin  with  respect  to LIBOR  Rate  Loans as in
                  effect from time to time.

                           (iii) The  Borrower  promises to pay interest on each
                  Revolving  Loan in arrears on each Interest  Payment Date with
                  respect thereto.

                           (iv)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if there shall
                  occur and be continuing any Event of Default, the principal of
                  all Revolving Loans  hereunder,  at the option of the Agent or
                  Required Lenders, shall bear interest at the Post-Default Rate
                  during the period  beginning on the date such Event of Default
                  first occurred and ending on the date such Event of Default is
                  cured or waived. All interest accrued at the Post-Default Rate
                  shall be payable on demand.  All accrued interest on Revolving
                  Loans shall be payable upon expiration of the Revolving Credit
                  Availability  Period. All interest and fees hereunder shall be
                  computed on the basis of a year of 360 days,  and in each case
                  shall  be  payable  for the  actual  number  of  days  elapsed
                  (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (d) REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS. The Borrower unconditionally
         promises  to pay to the Agent for the  account of each  Lender the then
         unpaid  principal  amount  of  such  Lender's  Revolving  Loans  on the
         Maturity  Date.  In addition,  if following  any reduction in the Total
         Revolving Credit Commitment or at any other time the Domestic Revolving
         Credit  Exposure  plus the  Canadian  Excess  Amount  shall  exceed the
         Domestic Gross Availability,  the Borrower shall first, repay Revolving
         Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, and second,  provide
         cash  collateral  for the Total LC Exposure as specified in  subsection
         2.4(h) in an aggregate amount equal to 105% of such excess.

                  (e) LOAN  ACCOUNTS.  Each Lender shall  maintain in accordance
         with its usual practice an account  evidencing the  indebtedness of the
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Revolving Loan made by such
         Lender,  including  the amounts of principal  and interest  payable and
         paid to such  Lender  from  time to time  hereunder.  The  Agent  shall
         maintain accounts in which it shall record the amount of each Revolving
         Loan made hereunder, the amount of any principal, interest, fees and/or
         expenses due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower
         to each  Lender  hereunder  and the amount of any sum  received  by the
         Agent  hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share
         thereof.  The  entries  made in the  account  maintained  by the  Agent
         pursuant to this subsection 2.1(e) shall be prima facie evidence of the
         existence and amounts of the  obligations  recorded  therein;  PROVIDED
         that the  failure of the Agent to  maintain  such  account or any error
         therein shall not in any manner  affect the  obligation of the Borrower
         to repay  the  Revolving  Loans in  accordance  with the  terms of this
         Agreement.

                  (f)  REVOLVING  CREDIT NOTE.  Prior to the Closing  Date,  the
         Borrower shall prepare,  execute and deliver to each Lender a Revolving
         Credit Note in the principal  amount of such Lender's  Revolving Credit
         Commitment. Thereafter, the Revolving Loans of each Lender evidenced by
         such  Revolving  Credit Note and  interest  thereon  shall at all times
         (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.4) be represented by
         one or more  promissory  notes in such form payable to the order of the
         payee named therein.

         2.2.  TERM LOAN.

                  (a)  FUNDING  OF THE  TERM  LOAN.  Subject  to the  terms  and
         conditions set forth herein,  each Lender agrees to fund its portion of
         the Term Loan in the full  amount of its Term  Loan  Commitment  on the
         Closing Date.  Principal amounts of the Term Loan that have been repaid
         or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

                  (b)  INTEREST  ON THE TERM  LOAN.  The  outstanding  principal
         amount of the Term Loan shall bear interest during each Interest Period
         relating to all or any portion of the Term Loan at the following rates:

                           (i) To the extent that all or any portion of the Term
                  Loan bears  interest  during such Interest  Period at the Base
                  Rate, the Term Loan or such portion shall bear interest during
                  such  Interest  Period at the rate per annum equal to the Base
                  Rate plus the  Applicable  Margin with  respect to portions of
                  Term Loans  consisting  of Base Rate  Loans as in effect  from
                  time to time.

                           (ii) To the  extent  that all or any  portion  of the
                  Term Loan bears  interest  during such Interest  Period at the
                  LIBOR Rate,  the Term Loan or such portion shall bear interest
                  during such Interest Period at the rate per annum equal to the
                  LIBOR  Rate  determined  for  such  Interest  Period  plus the
                  Applicable  Margin  with  respect  to  portions  of Term Loans
                  consisting of LIBOR Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

                           (iii) The  Borrower  promises to pay  interest on the
                  Term  Loan or any  portion  thereof  outstanding  during  each
                  Interest  Period in  arrears  on each  Interest  Payment  Date
                  applicable to such Interest Period.

                           (iv)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if there shall
                  occur and be continuing any Event of Default,  the outstanding
                  principal balance of the Term Loan, at the option of the Agent
                  or Required  Lenders,  shall bear interest at the Post-Default
                  Rate  during  the period  beginning  on the date such Event of
                  Default  first  occurred  and ending on the date such Event of
                  Default  is cured  or  waived.  All  interest  accrued  at the
                  Post-Default  Rate shall be payable  on demand.  All  interest
                  hereunder  shall  be  computed  on the  basis of a year of 360


                                       48

                  days,  and in each case shall be payable for the actual number
                  of days elapsed  (including  the first day but  excluding  the
                  last day).

                           (c)  REPAYMENT  OF  TERM  LOAN  The  Borrower  hereby
                  unconditionally  promises  to pay to the Agent for the account
                  of the Lenders the  outstanding  principal  amount of the Term
                  LOAN on each  principal  payment  date set forth  below in the

         If at any  time the sum of the  outstanding  amount  of the  Term  Loan
         exceeds  the  Term  Loan  Borrowing   Base,  then  the  Borrower  shall
         immediately pay the amount of such excess to the Agent, for the ratable
         benefit of the Lenders.

                  (d) LOAN  ACCOUNTS.  Each Lender shall  maintain in accordance
         with its usual practice an account  evidencing the  indebtedness of the
         Borrower  to such  Lender in respect of the Term  Loan,  including  the
         amounts of principal and interest  payable and paid to such Lender from
         time to time hereunder.  The Agent shall maintain  accounts in which it
         shall record the amount of each Lender's  portion of the Term Loan made
         hereunder,  the amount of any  principal or interest due and payable or
         to become due and payable  from the  Borrower to each Lender  hereunder
         and the  amount  of any sum  received  by the Agent  hereunder  for the
         account of the Lenders and each  Lender's  share  thereof.  The entries
         made in the account maintained by the Agent pursuant to this subsection
         2.2(d) shall be prima facie  evidence of the  existence  and amounts of
         the  obligations  recorded  therein;  PROVIDED  that the failure of the
         Agent to maintain  such account or any error  therein  shall not in any
         manner affect the  obligation of the Borrower to repay the Term Loan in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e) TERM NOTE.  Prior to the Closing Date,  the Borrower shall
         prepare,  execute  and  deliver  to  each  Lender  a Term  Note  in the
         principal  amount of such  Lender's Term Loan  Commitment.  Thereafter,
         such Lender's  portion of the Term Loan evidenced by such Term Note and
         interest  thereon  shall  at  all  times  (including  after  assignment
         pursuant  to Section  11.4) be  represented  by one or more  promissory
         notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein.

         2.3.  CONVERSION OPTIONS.

                  (a)  CONVERSION  TO  DIFFERENT  TYPE OF  REVOLVING  LOAN.  The
         Borrower  may  elect  from  time  to time to  convert  any  outstanding
         Revolving Loan to a Revolving  Loan of another Type,  PROVIDED that (a)
         with respect to any such conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate
         Loan,  the Borrower shall give the Agent at least two (2) Business Days
         prior  written  notice of such  election;  (b) with respect to any such
         conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall
         give the Agent at least  three (3) LIBOR  Business  Days prior  written
         notice of such election;  (c) with respect to any such  conversion of a
         LIBOR Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan,  such  conversion  shall only be
         made on the last day of the Interest  Period with  respect  thereto and
         (d) no Revolving  Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan when any
         Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. On the date
         on which  such  conversion  is being made each  Lender  shall take such
         action as is  necessary  to transfer its  Revolving  Credit  Commitment
         Percentage of such  Revolving  Loans to its Domestic  Lending Office or
         its  LIBOR  Lending  Office,  as the  case  may be.  All or any part of
         outstanding  Revolving  Loans  of  any  Type  may be  converted  into a
         Revolving  Loan of another Type as provided  herein,  PROVIDED that any
         partial  conversion  shall  be  in an  aggregate  principal  amount  of


                                       50

<PAGE>

         $1,000,000  or  a  whole  multiple  thereof.  Each  Conversion  Request
         relating to the  conversion  of a  Revolving  Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan
         shall be irrevocable by the Borrower.

                  (b) CONTINUATION OF TYPE OF REVOLVING LOAN. Any Revolving Loan
         of any Type may be continued as a Revolving  Loan of the same Type upon
         the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance
         by the Borrower  with the notice  provisions  contained  in  subsection
         2.3(a);  PROVIDED that no LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such when
         any Default or Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing,  but
         shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of
         the  first  Interest   Period   relating   thereto  ending  during  the
         continuance of any Default or Event of Default of which officers of the
         Agent active upon the Borrower's account have actual knowledge.  In the
         event that the  Borrower  fails to provide any such notice with respect
         to the  continuation  of any LIBOR  Rate Loan as such,  then such LIBOR
         Rate Loan shall be  automatically  converted to a Base Rate Loan on the
         last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto. The Agent shall
         notify  the  Lenders  promptly  when  any  such  automatic   conversion
         contemplated by this subsection 2.3(b) is scheduled to occur.

                  (c) LIBOR RATE  LOANS.  Any  conversion  to or from LIBOR Rate
         Loans shall be in such amounts and be made  pursuant to such  elections
         so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of
         all LIBOR Rate Loans having the same Interest  Period shall not be less
         than $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess  thereof.  No
         more than five (5) LIBOR Borrowings  having different  Interest Periods
         may be outstanding at any time.

                  (d) ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST.  If prior to the  commencement
         of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing,  (i) the Agent determines
         (which  determination  shall be conclusive  absent manifest error) that
         adequate and reasonable  means do not exist for  ascertaining the LIBOR
         Rate for such LIBOR  Interest  Period,  (ii) if such  Borrowing is of a
         particular Class of Loans, the Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
         with respect to the Revolving Loans or Terms Loans, as the case may be,
         that the LIBOR Rate for such Interest  Period will not  adequately  and
         fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining  their
         Loans of such Class included in such LIBOR  Borrowing,  or (iii) if the
         Agent or any  Lender  shall  have  determined  in good  faith that as a
         result of any Change in Law it is unlawful or impossible for any Lender
         to make or maintain  any LIBOR  Borrowing;  then in each case the Agent
         shall give notice  thereof to the Borrower and the affected  Lenders by
         telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable  thereafter and, until
         the Agent notifies the Borrower and such Lenders that the circumstances
         giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (x) any Advance  Conversion
         Request  for  LIBOR  Rate  Loans  submitted  by the  Borrower  shall be
         automatically  withdrawn  and shall be deemed a request for a Base Rate
         Loan, (y) each LIBOR Rate Loan will  automatically,  on the last day of
         the then current Interest Period relating  thereto,  become a Base Rate
         Loan,  and (z) the  obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans
         shall be suspended until the Agent  determines  that the  circumstances


                                       51

<PAGE>

         giving rise to such  suspension  no longer  exist,  whereupon the Agent
         shall so notify the  Borrower and the  Lenders;  PROVIDED  that if as a
         result of a Change in Law the Lenders are prohibited  from  maintaining
         any  outstanding  LIBOR  Borrowing,  upon  notice  from the Agent,  the
         Borrower shall  immediately  (A) convert such LIBOR Borrowing to a Base
         Rate  Borrowing,  or (B) repay such LIBOR  Borrowing in full,  together
         with all  interest  accrued  thereon  and all fees  and  other  amounts
         payable  to the  Lenders  hereunder  (in  either  case,  subject to the
         provisions  of  subsection  2.3(e) of this  Agreement  with  respect to
         redeployment costs).

                  (e) BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. In the event of (i) the payment of
         any  principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of the
         LIBOR Interest Period applicable  thereto  (including as a result of an
         Event of  Default),  (ii) the  conversion  of any LIBOR Rate Loan other
         than on the last day of the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  or
         (iii) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate
         Loan on the date  specified  in any notice  delivered  pursuant  hereto
         (regardless  of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable and is
         revoked in accordance herewith),  then, in any such event, the Borrower
         shall   compensate   each  Lender  for  the  loss,   cost  and  expense
         attributable  to such event (the  "BREAKAGE  COSTS"),  as determined by
         such Lender in a manner  consistent with its customs and practices.  In
         the event that any Lender is entitled to receive compensation  pursuant
         to this subsection  2.3(e),  such Lender shall deliver a certificate to
         the  Borrower  setting  forth the amount or amounts that such Lender is
         entitled to receive, and the Borrower shall pay such Lender such amount
         or amounts within three (3) days after receipt of such certificate.

         2.4. DOMESTIC LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FOREIGN LETTERS OF CREDIT.


                  (a) COMMITMENT TO ISSUE DOMESTIC LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FOREIGN
         LETTERS OF CREDIT AND LC GUARANTY.

                           (i)  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  set forth
                  herein,  the  Borrower may request the issuance of a letter of
                  credit in U.S.  currency (the "DOMESTIC LETTER OF CREDIT") for
                  its  own  account  and/or  for  the  account  of  any  of  its
                  Subsidiaries  by the Issuing  Lender,  in a form acceptable to
                  the Issuing  Lender,  at any time and from time to time during
                  the Revolving Credit Availability Period;  PROVIDED,  however,
                  that, after giving effect to such request, (a) the Domestic LC
                  Exposure shall not, at any time,  exceed  $12,000,000  and (b)
                  the  Domestic  Revolving  Credit  Exposure  plus the  Canadian
                  Excess   Amount   shall  not   exceed   the   Domestic   Gross
                  Availability.  Domestic  Letters  of Credit  issued  hereunder
                  shall   constitute   utilization   of  the  Revolving   Credit
                  Commitments.  In the event of any  inconsistency  between  the
                  terms  and  conditions  of this  Agreement  and the  terms and
                  conditions  of any form of  letter of  credit  application  or
                  other agreement  submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into
                  by the  Borrower  with,  the  Issuing  Lender  relating to any
                  Domestic  Letter of Credit,  the terms and  conditions of this
                  Agreement shall control.

                           (ii)  Subject to the terms and  conditions  set forth
                  herein,  the  Borrower may request the issuance of a letter of
                  credit in an Optional  Currency (a "FOREIGN LETTER OF CREDIT")
                  for its own  account  and/or  for  the  account  of any of its
                  Subsidiaries  by the Issuing  Lender,  in a form acceptable to
                  the Issuing  Lender,  at any time and from time to time during
                  the Revolving Credit Availability Period;  PROVIDED,  however,
                  that,  after  giving  effect to such  request,  (a) the Dollar
                  Equivalent  of  the  Foreign  LC  Exposure  (exclusive  of the
                  Canadian Letter of Credit) shall not exceed  $5,000,000 at any
                  one time and (b) the Domestic  Revolving  Credit Exposure plus
                  the Canadian Excess Amount shall not exceed the Domestic Gross
                  Availability.  Foreign  Letters  of  Credit  issued  hereunder
                  (exclusive  of the Canadian  Letter of Credit to the extent of
                  the Canadian  Borrowing Base) shall constitute  utilization of
                  the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments in the amount of the
                  Dollar  Equivalent  of such Foreign  Letter of Credit.  In the
                  event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of
                  this  Agreement  and the terms and  conditions  of any form of
                  letter of credit  application or other agreement  submitted by
                  the Borrower to, or entered  into by the  Borrower  with,  the
                  Issuing Lender  relating to any Foreign Letter of Credit,  the
                  terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                           (iii) The Agent agrees,  on behalf of the Lenders and
                  in  reliance  upon the  agreement  of the Lenders set forth in
                  this  subsection  2.4(d)  and  upon  the  representations  and
                  warranties of the Credit Parties  contained  herein,  to enter
                  into an LC  Guaranty  with the  Issuing  Lender to support the
                  reimbursement  obligations of the Borrower with respect to any


                                       53

<PAGE>

                  Letter of Credit and the  Canadian  Borrowers  with respect to
                  the Canadian Letter of Credit.

                  (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, EXTENSION; CERTAIN
         CONDITIONS.  Subject to Section  2.14,  to request  the  issuance  of a
         Letter  of  Credit  (or  the  amendment,  renewal  or  extension  of an
         outstanding  Letter of  Credit),  the  Borrower  shall  deliver  to the
         Issuing  Lender and the Agent by electronic  or facsimile  transmission
         (at  least  two  (2)  Business  Days  prior  to the  requested  date of
         issuance,   amendment,   renewal  or  extension)  a  letter  of  credit
         application  and  reimbursement  agreement in the form  required by the
         Issuing Lender. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
         extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
         each Letter of Credit,  the Borrower  shall be deemed to represent  and
         warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal
         or extension (i) the Domestic LC Exposure at such time shall not exceed
         $12,000,000  and the Dollar  Equivalent  of the  Foreign LC Exposure at
         such time (exclusive of the Canadian Letter of Credit) shall not exceed
         $5,000,000,  as the case may be and (ii) the Domestic  Revolving Credit
         Exposure plus the Canadian  Excess Amount at such time shall not exceed
         the Domestic Gross Availability.  Any Letter of Credit issued, amended,
         renewed or extended  hereunder  shall  provide for the payment of sight
         drafts for honor thereunder when presented in accordance with the terms
         thereof and when accompanied by the documents described therein.

                  (c)  EXPIRATION  DATE.  Each  Letter  of Credit  shall  expire
         (without  giving  effect  to any  extension  thereof  by  reason  of an
         interruption  of  business) at or prior to the close of business on the
         earlier  of (i) the date 365 days,  in the case of  standby  Letters of
         Credit,  or 180 days,  in the case of  documentary  Letters  of Credit,
         after the date of the  issuance  of such  Letter of Credit  (or, in the
         case of any  renewal or  extension  thereof,  365 days or 180 days,  as
         applicable,  after such renewal or  extension)  PROVIDED  that any such
         standby Letter of Credit may provide for automatic  extensions  thereof
         to a date not later than 365 days beyond its current  expiration  date,
         and (ii) the date that is five (5) or,  if  confirmed  by a  confirmer,
         thirty (30),  Business  Days prior to the Maturity  Date.  No Letter of
         Credit may be extended beyond the date that is five Business Days prior
         to the Maturity Date.

                  (d)      PARTICIPATIONS.

                           (i) By the  issuance  of a Letter  of  Credit  (or an
                  amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof)
                  by the Issuing  Lender,  and without any further action on the
                  part of the Issuing  Lender,  the Issuing Lender hereby grants
                  to each  Lender,  and each  Lender  hereby  acquires  from the
                  Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
                  to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount
                  available  to  be  drawn  under  such  Letter  of  Credit.  In
                  consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender
                  hereby  absolutely  and  unconditionally  agrees to pay to the
                  Agent,  for the account of the Issuing  Lender,  such Lender's


                                       54

<PAGE>

                  Applicable  Percentage  of  each LC  Disbursement  made by the
                  Issuing  Lender and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date
                  due as provided in subsection  2.4(e), or of any reimbursement
                  payment  required  to be  refunded  to the  Borrower  for  any
                  reason.

                           (ii) By the issuance of the LC Guaranty by the Agent,
                  and without any further  action on the part of the Agent,  the
                  Agent  hereby  grants to each Lender,  and each Lender  hereby
                  acquires from the Agent,  a  participation  in the LC Guaranty
                  equal to such Lender's Applicable  Percentage of the aggregate
                  amount  guaranteed  under  the LC  Guaranty.  In the event the
                  Agent is required  to make any  payment to the Issuing  Lender
                  under the LC  Guaranty,  each  Lender  hereby  absolutely  and
                  unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of
                  the Issuing  Lender,  such Lender's  Applicable  Percentage of
                  each such payment made by the Agent and not  reimbursed by the
                  Borrower  or  the  Canadian  Borrowers,  as  the  case  may be
                  pursuant to subsection 2.4(e), or of any reimbursement payment
                  required to be refunded to the  Borrower  for any reason,  and
                  each  Lender  severally  agrees  that it shall  be  absolutely
                  liable,  without  regard to the  occurrence  of any Default or
                  Event of Default or any other condition precedent  whatsoever,
                  to the  extent  of such  Lender's  Applicable  Percentage,  to
                  reimburse the Agent on demand for such payment.

                  (e)  REIMBURSEMENT.  If the Issuing  Lender  shall make any LC
         Disbursement  in respect of a Letter of Credit or the Agent  shall make
         any payment under the LC Guaranty, the Borrower and/or, with respect to
         the Canadian Letter of Credit, the Canadian Borrowers,  shall reimburse
         (each, a  "REIMBURSEMENT  OBLIGATION") the Issuing Lender in respect of
         such LC  Disbursement or the Agent in respect of such payment under the
         LC Guaranty, as the case may be, by paying to the Agent for the account
         of the  Issuing  Lender or to the Agent with  respect  to such  payment
         under  the LC  Guaranty,  an amount  in U.S.  Dollars  equal to such LC
         Disbursement  (or the Dollar  Equivalent of such LC Disbursement in the
         case of a Letter of  Credit  issued in an  Optional  Currency)  or such
         payment  under the LC  Guaranty  not  later  than  1:00  p.m.,  Boston,
         Massachusetts  time,  on (i) the  Business Day that the Borrower or any
         Canadian  Borrower  receives  notice  of such LC  Disbursement  or such
         payment  under the LC  Guaranty,  if such notice is  received  prior to
         11:00  a.m.,  Boston,  Massachusetts  time,  or (ii) the  Business  Day
         immediately  following  the  day  that  the  Borrower  or any  Canadian
         Borrower  receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to
         such time,  PROVIDED  that,  subject to the conditions to borrowing set
         forth herein,  payment of each such  Reimbursement  Obligation shall be
         made  through  the  automatic  funding of a Base Rate  Borrowing  in an


                                       55

<PAGE>

         amount equal to the amount of such  Reimbursement  Obligation,  and the
         Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  authorizes and directs the Agent to take
         such actions as may be necessary to effectuate  such automatic  funding
         of such Base Rate Borrowings. To the extent that any such Reimbursement
         Obligation  is  paid  through  the  automatic  funding  of a Base  Rate
         Borrowing,  the  Borrower's  obligation  to make such payment  shall be
         discharged  and replaced by the resulting Base Rate  Borrowing.  If the
         Borrower  cannot  satisfy the  conditions to borrowing set forth herein
         such that the payment of any  Reimbursement  Obligation  cannot be made
         through  the  automatic  funding  of a Base Rate  Borrowing  and/or the
         Borrower or any Canadian  Borrower shall fail, for any reason,  to make
         such  payment  when due,  the Agent  shall  notify  each  Lender of the
         applicable LC Disbursement and/or such payments made by the Agent under
         the LC Guaranty,  the  unreimbursed  portion  thereof and such Lender's
         Applicable  Percentage  thereof.  Promptly  following  receipt  of such
         notice,  each  Lender  shall  pay to the  Agent  in  U.S.  Dollars  its
         Applicable   Percentage   of  the   unreimbursed   portion  of  the  LC
         Disbursement  and/or  any  payments  made  by the  Agent  under  the LC
         Guaranty, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.5 with respect to
         Loans made by such Lender  (and  Section 2.5 shall apply to the payment
         obligations  of the Lenders,  treating  each such payment as a Loan for
         this  purpose),  and the Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Lender
         the  amounts so  received by it from the  Lenders.  Promptly  following
         receipt by the Agent of any payment  from the  Borrower or any Canadian
         Borrower  pursuant to this paragraph,  the Agent shall  distribute such
         payment to the Issuing  Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders  have
         made  payments  pursuant to this  paragraph  to purchase  participation
         interests in the LC Disbursement  and/or the LC Guaranty,  then to such
         Lenders  and the Issuing  Lender as their  interests  may  appear.  Any
         payment  made by a Lender  pursuant  to this  paragraph  to  purchase a
         participation  interest in any LC Disbursement or any LC Guaranty shall
         not  constitute  a Loan and  shall  not  relieve  the  Borrower  or any
         Canadian  Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC  Disbursement
         or any  payment  made  by the  Agent  under  the LC  Guaranty.  For the
         avoidance  of doubt,  all  Reimbursement  Obligations  with  respect to
         Domestic  Letters of Credit or Foreign  Letters of Credit,  as the case
         may be, shall be paid in U.S. Dollars. The Borrower shall indemnify and
         hold  harmless the Issuing  Lender and the Agent for any loss,  cost or
         expense  incurred  by such  Persons  as a result  of any  change in the
         currency  exchange rate  occurring  during the period  between the date
         that  the  Issuing  Lender  makes  payment  on  any  Letter  of  Credit
         denominated in an Optional  Currency and/or the Agent makes any payment
         of the LC Guaranty with respect to any Letter of Credit  denominated in
         an Optional  Currency and the date on which the Issuing  Lender  and/or
         the Agent receives final  reimbursement  in U.S. Dollars for the Dollar
         Equivalent of the amount of such payment.

                  (f)  OBLIGATIONS  ABSOLUTE.  The  Borrower's  and the Canadian
         Borrowers'  obligations  to reimburse LC  Disbursements  or any payment
         made by the Agent under the LC  Guaranty,  as  provided  in  subsection
         2.4(e) shall be absolute,  unconditional and irrevocable,  and shall be
         performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under
         any and all  circumstances  whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack
         of  validity  or  enforceability  of any  Letter  of  Credit  or the LC
         Guaranty,  or any term or  provision  therein,  (ii) any draft or other
         document  presented  under a Letter of  Credit  proving  to be  forged,
         fraudulent  or invalid in any respect or any  statement  therein  being
         untrue or  inaccurate  in any  respect,  (iii)  payment by the  Issuing


                                       56

<PAGE>

         Lender to the beneficiary under a Letter of Credit against presentation
         of a draft or other  document  that does not  comply  with the terms of
         such  Letter  of  Credit  and (iv)  any  other  event  or  circumstance
         whatsoever  (other than gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of the
         Issuing Lender),  whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,  that
         might,  but for the provisions of this Section 2.4,  constitute a legal
         or equitable discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

                  (g) INTERIM  INTEREST.  If the Issuing Lender and/or the Agent
         shall  make any LC  Disbursement  in  respect  of any  Letter of Credit
         and/or any payment in respect of the LC Guaranty , and if the  Borrower
         cannot  satisfy the  conditions to borrowing set forth herein such that
         payment  of  the  Reimbursement   Obligation  resulting  from  such  LC
         Disbursement  or with respect to the LC Guaranty cannot be made through
         the  automatic  funding  of a Base Rate  Borrowing,  then,  unless  the
         Borrower or the Canadian Borrowers, as applicable, shall reimburse such
         LC  Disbursement  or such payment made by the Agent with respect to the
         LC Guaranty in full on the date such LC Disbursement or such payment is
         made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest,  for each day from
         and including the date such LC  Disbursement or such payment is made to
         but excluding the date that the Borrower or the Canadian Borrowers,  as
         applicable,  reimburses such LC  Disbursement  or such payment,  at the
         rate per annum then  applicable to Base Rate Loans;  PROVIDED  that, if
         the  Borrower  or  any  Canadian  Borrower,  as  applicable,  fails  to
         reimburse  such LC  Disbursement  or such  payment when due pursuant to
         subsection  2.4(e),  then interest  calculated at the Post-Default Rate
         shall accrue on the unpaid amount thereof. Interest accrued pursuant to
         this  paragraph  shall be for the account of the Issuing  Lender or the
         Agent,  as the case may be, except that  interest  accrued on and after
         the date of payment by any Lender  pursuant to subsection  2.4(e) shall
         be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (h) CASH COLLATERALIZATION.  If either (i) an Event of Default
         shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower receives notice from the
         Agent or the Required Lenders  demanding the deposit of cash collateral
         pursuant to this  paragraph,  or (ii) the Borrower shall be required to
         provide  cash  collateral  in the amount  equal to 105% of the Total LC
         Exposure pursuant to subsections  2.1(d) or 2.8(b),  the Borrower shall
         immediately  deposit  with the Agent an amount in cash equal to, in the
         case of an Event of Default, the Total LC Exposure as of such date PLUS
         any accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon and any letter of credit fees
         incurred  thereunder  accrued or to be accrued  and, in the case of any
         cash collateral  required to be provided pursuant to subsections 2.1(d)
         or 2.8(b),  the amount required under subsections  2.1(d) or 2.8(b), as
         the case may be;  PROVIDED  that the  obligation  to deposit  such cash
         collateral shall become effective  immediately,  and such deposit shall
         become  immediately due and payable,  without demand or other notice of
         any kind,  upon the  occurrence  of any Event of Default  described  in
         clause (g) or (h) of Section  9.1.  Such  deposit  shall be held by the
         Agent as  collateral  in the first  instance  for the Total LC Exposure


                                       57

<PAGE>

         under  this  Agreement  and  thereafter  for the  payment  of any other
         obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder.

         2.5.  LOANS AND BORROWINGS; FUNDING OF BORROWINGS.

                  (a) LOANS AND  BORROWINGS.  Each  Loan of a  particular  Class
         shall be made as part of a Borrowing  consisting of Loans of such Class
         made  by the  Lenders  ratably  in  accordance  with  their  respective
         Commitments  of such Class.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan
         required  to be made by it shall not  relieve  any other  Lender of its
         obligations hereunder; PROVIDED that the Commitments of the Lenders are
         several  and no Lender  shall be  responsible  for any  other  Lender's
         failure to make Loans as required herein.

                  (b) FUNDING OF BORROWINGS. Each Lender shall make each Loan to
         be made by it hereunder on the proposed  date thereof by wire  transfer
         of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., Boston, Massachusetts time
         to the  account of the Agent most  recently  designated  by it for such
         purpose  by  notice to the  Lenders.  The  Agent  will make such  Loans
         available  to  the  Borrower  by  promptly  crediting  the  amounts  so
         received,  in like  funds,  to one or  more  accounts  of the  Borrower
         maintained with the Agent; PROVIDED that Revolving Base Rate Loans made
         to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement  under any Letter of
         Credit as provided  in  subsection  2.4(e) or any  payment  made by the
         Agent  under  the LC  Guaranty  shall be  remitted  by the Agent to the
         Issuing Lender.

                  (c)  AGENT'S  ASSUMPTION  THAT EACH  LENDER  WILL MAKE  LOANS.
         Unless the Agent shall have received  notice from a Lender prior to the
         proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available
         to the  Agent  such  Lender's  share of such  Borrowing,  the Agent may
         assume that such Lender has made such share  available  on such date in
         accordance  with paragraph (b) of this Section 2.5 and may, in reliance
         upon such  assumption,  make available to the Borrower a  corresponding
         amount.  In such  event,  if a Lender has not in fact made its share of
         the applicable  Borrowing  available to the Agent,  then the applicable
         Lender and the Borrower  agree to pay to the Agent  forthwith on demand
         such corresponding  amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
         including  the date such amount is made  available  to the Borrower but
         excluding  the date of  payment  to the  Agent,  at the  Federal  Funds
         Effective Rate. If such Lender pays such amount to the Agent, then such
         amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                  (d) SETTLEMENT.  In order to facilitate the  administration of
         the Loans  under this  Agreement,  the Agent and  Lenders  agree  (such
         agreement  shall not be for the benefit of or enforceable by the Credit
         Parties) that settlement among them with respect to the Revolving Loans
         may take place on a periodic basis (but not less  frequently  than once
         each week) on dates  determined  from time to time by the Agent (each a
         "SETTLEMENT  DATE"),  which may occur before or after the occurrence or
         during the  continuance  of any  Default or Event of  Default.  On each
         Settlement  Date,  payment  shall be made by or to each  Lender  in the


                                       58

<PAGE>

         manner  provided  herein and in accordance  with the settlement  report
         delivered by the Agent to the Lenders  with respect to such  Settlement
         Date so that, as of each Settlement Date and after giving effect to the
         transactions to take place on such  Settlement  Date, each Lender shall
         hold its Applicable  Percentage of all outstanding  Revolving Loans and
         its Applicable Percentage of the Total LC Exposure.

                  (e) SETTLEMENT LOANS.  Between Settlement Dates, the Agent may
         but shall not be  obligated  to advance (or may request that one of its
         Affiliates  advance),  to the  Borrower  out of the  Agent's  (or  such
         Affiliate's)  own funds up to $7,500,000 in the aggregate of Borrowings
         that are Base  Rate  Revolving  Loans  requested  or  deemed  requested
         pursuant to this Agreement (any such  Borrowing  funded  exclusively by
         the Agent or its Affiliate  being referred to as a "SETTLEMENT  LOAN").
         Each  Settlement  Loan shall  constitute a Revolving Loan hereunder and
         shall  be  subject  to  all  of  the  terms,  conditions  and  security
         applicable to other Revolving  Loans,  except that all payments thereon
         shall be  payable  to the Agent (or its  Affiliate)  solely for its own
         account.  The obligation of the Borrower to repay such Settlement Loans
         to the Agent (or its  Affiliate)  shall be  evidenced by the records of
         the Agent and need not be evidenced by any  promissory  note. The Agent
         shall not (and  shall not  permit  any of its  Affiliates  to) make any
         Settlement  Loan if (i) the Agent shall have  received  written  notice
         from any Lender that one or more of the applicable conditions precedent
         set forth in Sections  6.1 or 6.2 hereof will not be  satisfied  on the
         requested  funding date of the  applicable  Borrowing or (ii) the Agent
         has actual  knowledge  that the  requested  Borrowing  would exceed the
         limitations  set forth in  Section  2.1 on the  funding  date.  On each
         Settlement  Date, or, if earlier,  upon demand by the Agent for payment
         thereof, the then outstanding Settlement Loans shall be immediately due
         and payable. The Borrower shall be deemed to have requested Loans to be
         made  on  each  Settlement  Date  in  the  amount  of  all  outstanding
         Settlement Loans and the proceeds of such Loans shall be applied to the
         repayment of such Settlement  Loans. The Agent shall notify the Lenders
         of the  outstanding  balance  of the Loans  prior to 1:00 p.m.  (Boston
         time) on each  Settlement  Date and each Lender shall  deposit with the
         Agent an amount  equal to its  Applicable  Percentage  of the amount of
         Revolving  Loans deemed  requested in immediately  available  funds not
         later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on such Settlement Date, and without
         regard to whether any Default or Event of Default  exists or any of the
         conditions in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 are not satisfied.  If any Settlement
         Loan is not repaid on the due date thereof, then on the second Business
         Day after the Agent's  request each Lender (other than the Agent in its
         capacity as a Lender) shall purchase a  participating  interest in such
         Settlement Loan in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of such
         Settlement Loan by transferring to the Agent, in immediately  available
         funds, the amount of such  participation,  without  duplication for any
         payment  previously  made. The proceeds of Settlement Loans may be used
         solely for purposes for which Loans generally may be used in accordance
         with this Agreement. If any amounts received by the Agent in respect of
         any  Settlement  Loans are later required to be returned or paid by the
         Agent  to  the  Borrower  or  their   respective   representatives   or


                                       59

<PAGE>

         successors-in-interest,   whether  by  court   order,   settlement   or
         otherwise,  the other Lenders shall,  upon demand by the Agent,  pay to
         the Agent for its own account,  an amount equal to each other  Lender's
         Applicable  Percentage  of all such amounts  required to be returned by
         the Agent.

         2.6.  EXPIRATION, TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

                  (a)  EXPIRATION  OF  REVOLVING  CREDIT   COMMITMENTS.   Unless
         previously  terminated,  (i) the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  shall
         expire at the close of business on the Maturity Date, and (ii) the Term
         Loan Commitments  shall terminate  immediately after the funding of the
         Term Loan on the Closing Date.

                  (b) REDUCTION OF REVOLVING  CREDIT  COMMITMENTS.  The Borrower
         may at any time and  from  time to time  reduce  the  Revolving  Credit
         Commitments;  PROVIDED that (i) each reduction of the Revolving  Credit
         Commitments  shall be in an amount that is at least equal to $1,000,000
         or any greater multiple of $1,000,000,  and (ii) the Borrower shall not
         reduce the Revolving Credit  Commitments if, after giving effect to any
         concurrent  repayment,  the Domestic  Revolving  Credit  Exposure would
         exceed the Domestic  Revolving  Credit  Commitment.  The Borrower shall
         notify  the  Agent of any  election  to  reduce  the  Revolving  Credit
         Commitment at least five (5) Business Days prior to the effective  date
         of such reduction,  specifying the effective date thereof.  Each notice
         of reduction of the Revolving  Credit  Commitment shall be irrevocable.
         Each reduction of the Revolving  Credit  Commitment  shall be permanent
         and shall be made ratably  among the Lenders in  accordance  with their
         respective Revolving Credit Commitments.

                  (c)  OPTIONAL  TERMINATION  OF REVOLVING  CREDIT  COMMITMENTS.
         Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6(d), the Borrower shall have
         the right at any time to terminate  the Revolving  Credit  Commitments.
         The Borrower  shall  notify the Agent of any election to terminate  the
         Revolving Credit Commitments under this subsection 2.6(c) in writing at
         least  five  (5)  Business  Days  prior to the  effective  date of such
         termination,  specifying  the effective  date  thereof.  Each notice of
         termination of the Revolving Credit  Commitments  shall be irrevocable.
         Any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanent.

                  (d) TERMINATION FEE. In connection with any termination of the
         Revolving Credit  Commitments,  the Borrower shall (i) repay the entire
         principal  balance  of, and all  accrued  interest  and fees owing with
         respect to, the Revolving Loans and the Term Loans, and (ii) pay to the
         Agent,  for the account of each Lender,  a termination fee equal to the
         product  of (A) the  sum of (x) the  average  amount  of the  Revolving
         Credit  Commitments during the twelve (12) months preceding the date of
         termination  (or,  if  such  termination  occurs  prior  to  the  first
         anniversary of the Closing Date,  during the period between the Closing
         Date and the date of  termination),  and (y) the average  amount of the
         aggregate  outstanding  principal  balance of the Term Loan  during the
         twelve  months   preceding  the  date  of  termination   (or,  if  such


                                       60

<PAGE>

         termination  occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
         during the period between the Closing Date and the date of termination)
         MULTIPLIED  by (B) the  applicable  termination  percentage  set  forth
         below:

         Prior to the first anniversary of the
         Closing Date                                               1.0%

         2.7.  PAYMENTS  GENERALLY;  PRO RATA  TREATMENT;  SHARING OF  SET-OFFS;
         COLLECTION.

                  (a)  PAYMENTS   GENERALLY.   The  Borrower  and  the  Canadian
         Borrowers  shall be obligated to make each payment  required to be made
         by the  Borrower  or  such  Canadian  Borrower  hereunder  (whether  of
         principal,  interest,  fees or  reimbursement of LC  Disbursements,  or
         otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m. Boston,  Massachusetts  time, on the date
         when due, in immediately  available  funds,  in U.S.  Dollars,  without
         set-off or  counterclaim.  Any amounts  received after such time on any
         date  may,  in the  discretion  of the  Agent,  be  deemed to have been
         received  on  the  next   succeeding   Business  Day  for  purposes  of
         calculating  interest thereon.  All payments shall be made to the Agent
         at its offices in Boston, Massachusetts,  except that payments pursuant
         to Sections 2.4, 2.10,  2.11, 11.3 and subsection  2.3(e) shall be made
         directly to the Persons  entitled  thereto.  The Agent shall distribute
         any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to
         the appropriate  recipient promptly following receipt thereof,  and the
         Borrower  and the  Canadian  Borrowers  shall have no  liability in the
         event timely or correct  distribution  of such payments is not so made.
         If any payment  shall be due on a day that is not a Business  Day,  the
         date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
         and, in the case of any payment  accruing  interest,  interest  thereon
         shall be  payable  for the  period of such  extension.  Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary set forth herein, subject to the conditions to
         the  funding of  Revolving  Loans set forth  herein,  all  payments  of
         interest,  fees and any other amounts due to be paid by the Borrower or
         any Canadian  Borrower  hereunder  shall be made through the  automatic
         funding of Base Rate Revolving Loans in amounts equal to the amounts of
         such interest,  fees or other amounts due to be paid by the Borrower or
         such Canadian  Borrower  hereunder,  and the Borrower and each Canadian
         Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  authorizes and directs the Agent to take
         such actions as may be necessary to effectuate  such automatic  funding
         of Base Rate Revolving  Loans,  and, upon funding of any such Base Rate


                                       61

<PAGE>

         Revolving Loan, the Borrower's and each Canadian Borrower's  obligation
         to make such payment shall be discharged  and replaced by the resulting
         Base Rate  Revolving  Loan.  The  Borrower and each  Canadian  Borrower
         expressly  acknowledges  and agrees that (i) the Agent may, in its sole
         discretion,  effectuate  the  automatic  funding  of a  Revolving  Loan
         pursuant to this subsection 2.7(a) even though at the time of, or after
         giving  effect to, the  funding of such  Revolving  Loans the  Domestic
         Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Domestic Gross Availability,  and
         (ii) if any one or more of the  conditions  to the funding of Revolving
         Loans  cannot  be  satisfied  and the  Agent,  in its sole  discretion,
         refuses to fund a Base Rate Revolving  Loan in an amount  sufficient to
         satisfy  the  amount  of  any  interest,  fees  or  other  amounts  due
         hereunder,  the  Borrower  and  such  Canadian  Borrower  shall  remain
         obligated  to pay the  full  amount  of such  interest,  fees or  other
         amounts as and when the same shall become due.

                  (b) CURRENCY MATTERS.

                           (i) U.S.  Dollars  are the  currency  of account  and
                  payment for each and every sum at any time due from the Credit
                  Parties hereunder.  No payment to the Agent, any Lender or the
                  Issuing  Lender  (whether under any judgment or court order or
                  otherwise)  shall  discharge  the  obligation  or liability in
                  respect  of which it was made  unless  and  until the Agent or
                  such  Lender  shall  have  received  payment  in  full in U.S.
                  Dollars in which such  obligation  or liability  was incurred,
                  and to the extent that the amount of any such  payment  shall,
                  on actual  conversion  into U.S.  Dollars,  fall short of such
                  obligation or liability actual or contingent expressed in U.S.
                  Dollars,  the Borrower  shall  indemnify and hold harmless the
                  Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender,  as the case may be,
                  with respect to the amount of the shortfall.

                           (ii) Not later  than 1:00 p.m.  (Boston  time) on the
                  last  Business Day of each  calendar  month (the  "CALCULATION
                  DATE") or such  other  date as the Agent may from time to time
                  specify,  the Agent shall  determine the Dollar  Equivalent of
                  Total LC Exposures as of such date.  The Dollar  Equivalent so
                  determined  shall become  effective on the first  Business Day
                  immediately  following such determination (a "RESET DATE") and
                  shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date.

                           (iii) If, on any Reset Date, the Dollar Equivalent of
                  the aggregate  outstanding  amount of all Revolving  Loans and
                  Total LC Exposure  exceeds the Total Gross  Availability,  for
                  three (3) or more  consecutive  Business  Days (but only as to
                  the Reset Date),  then the Borrower  shall repay or prepay the
                  Revolving  Loans  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement  in an
                  aggregate  principal  amount such that,  after  giving  effect
                  thereto,  the aggregate  outstanding amount (expressed in U.S.
                  Dollars)  of all  Revolving  Loans PLUS Total LC  Exposure  no
                  longer exceeds the Total Gross Availability.

                           (iv) If on any Reset Date,  the Dollar  Equivalent of
                  the Foreign LC Exposure  (exclusive of the Canadian  Letter of
                  Credit)   exceeds   $5,000,000,   then  the   Borrower   shall
                  immediately  upon demand provide cash  collateral to the Agent
                  in the amount of such excess.

                  (c) PREPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING LOANS PRIOR TO EVENT OF DEFAULT.

                           (i)   CREDIT  FOR  FUNDS   RECEIVED.   Prior  to  the
                  occurrence  of an Event of  Default,  (A) all  funds  and cash
                  proceeds in the form of money,  checks and like items received
                  in the Controlled  Account  maintained at the Cash  Management
                  Bank as contemplated  by Section 4.3(a) shall be credited,  on
                  the same Business Day on which the Agent  determines that good
                  collected funds have been received,  and, prior to the receipt
                  of good collected  funds,  on a provisional  basis until final
                  receipt of good collected  funds,  and applied as contemplated
                  by subsection  2.7(c)(ii),  (B) all funds and cash proceeds in
                  the form of a wire transfer received in the Controlled Account
                  maintained  at the Cash  Management  Bank as  contemplated  by
                  Section  4.3(a) shall be credited on the same  Business Day as
                  the Agent's  receipt of such amounts (or up to such later date
                  as the Agent  determines  that good collected  funds have been
                  received),   and  applied  as   contemplated   by   subsection
                  2.7(c)(ii), and (C) all funds and cash proceeds in the form of
                  an  automated   clearing  house   transfer   received  in  the
                  Controlled  Account  maintained at the Cash Management Bank as
                  contemplated by Section 4.3(a) shall be credited,  on the next
                  Business Day following the Agent's receipt of such amounts (or
                  up to  such  later  date as the  Agent  determines  that  good
                  collected   funds  have  been   received),   and   applied  as
                  contemplated  by  subsection  2.7(c)(ii).  For purposes of the
                  foregoing provisions of this subsection  2.7(c)(i),  the Agent
                  shall not be deemed to have  received  any such  funds or cash
                  proceeds on any day unless  received by the Agent  before 1:00
                  p.m.   (Boston  time)  on  such  day.  The  Borrower   further
                  acknowledges and agrees that any such  provisional  credits or
                  credits in respect of wire or automatic  clearing  house funds
                  transfers shall be subject to reversal if final  collection in
                  good funds of the related  item is not  received  by, or final
                  settlement of the funds  transfer is not made in favor of, the
                  Agent in accordance with the Agent's customary  procedures and
                  practices  for  collecting   provisional  items  or  receiving
                  settlement of funds transfers.

                           (ii)  APPLICATION  OF PAYMENTS.  Prior to an Event of
                  Default,  funds received in the Controlled  Account maintained
                  at the Cash  Management Bank as contemplated by Section 4.3(a)
                  and for  which  the  Borrower  has  received  credit  shall be
                  applied as follows:

                                    (A)  first,  to pay  amounts  then  due  and
                           payable under this Agreement, the Notes and the other
                           Loan  Documents   (including,   without   limitation,
                           pursuant to Section 2.8);

                                    (B) second,  to reduce  Revolving Loans made
                           by the Agent  pursuant to  subsection  2.5(e) and for
                           which Settlement has not then been made;

                                    (C) third,  to reduce  Revolving Loans which
                           are Base Rate Loans;

                                    (D) fourth,  to reduce Revolving Loans which
                           are LIBOR Rate Loans;

                                    (E) fifth, to reduce the Term Loan; and

                                    (F)  sixth,  to  the  Borrower's   operating
                           account maintained with the Cash Management Bank.

                           All  prepayments  of the Revolving  Loans pursuant to
                  this  subsection  2.7(c) shall be subject to the provisions of
                  Section 2.3(e) and shall be allocated among the Lenders making
                  such Revolving Loans, in proportion, as nearly as practicable,
                  to the respective  unpaid  principal  amount of such Revolving
                  Loans outstanding,  with adjustments to the extent practicable
                  to equalize any prior  payments or  repayments  not exactly in
                  proportion.

                           Prior to the  occurrence of an Event of Default,  the
                  Borrower may elect to avoid the Breakage Costs associated with
                  any  prepayment  of LIBOR Rate Loans by providing to the Agent
                  cash in an amount sufficient to cash  collateralize such LIBOR
                  Rate Loans,  but in no event  shall the  Borrower be deemed to
                  have paid such LIBOR Rate Loans  until such cash has been paid
                  to the Agent for  application  to such Libor Rate  Loans.  The
                  Agent may elect to cause such cash  collateral to be deposited
                  into  either (i) a cash  collateral  account  pursuant  to the
                  terms of a cash collateral  agreement executed by the Borrower
                  and the Agent and in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the
                  Agent  or  (ii)  a   Controlled   Account   with   appropriate
                  instructions  prohibiting  the  Borrower's  withdrawal of such
                  funds so long as they  remain  cash  collateral.  In each such
                  case, the Borrower  agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent
                  such instruments and documents,  including Uniform  Commercial
                  Code financing  statements and agreements with any third party
                  depository banks, as the Agent may request.

                  (d) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.  After the
         occurrence  and during the  continuance  of an Event of Default,  funds
         received in the Controlled  Account  maintained at the Cash  Management
         Bank as  contemplated  by Section 4.3(a) and for which the Borrower has
         received credit and proceeds of Collateral  received by the Agent shall
         be applied as set forth in Section 9.2.

                  (e) PRO RATA TREATMENT. If any Lender shall, by exercising any
         right of  set-off  or  counterclaim  or  otherwise,  obtain  payment in
         respect  of any  principal  of or  interest  on any  of its  Loans  (or
         participations  in LC  Disbursements)  (other than pursuant to Sections
         2.4,  2.10 or 2.11),  resulting in such Lender  receiving  payment of a
         greater proportion of the aggregate  principal amount of its Loans (and
         participations in LC  Disbursements)  and accrued interest thereon than
         the proportion of such amounts  received by any other Lender,  then the
         Lender  receiving such greater  proportion  shall purchase (for cash at
         face value)  participations  in the Loans (and LC Disbursements) of the
         other  Lenders  to the  extent  necessary  so that the  benefit of such
         payments shall be shared by all the Lenders  ratably in accordance with
         the  aggregate  amount of  principal  of and accrued  interest on their
         respective Loans (and  participations  in LC  Disbursements);  PROVIDED
         that  (i) if any  such  participations  are  purchased  and  all or any
         portion  of  the  payment  giving  rise  thereto  is  recovered,   such
         participations  shall be rescinded and the purchase  price  restored to
         the extent of such recovery,  without  interest  unless the Lender from
         which such payment is recovered is required to pay interest thereon, in
         which case each Lender returning funds to such Lender shall pay its pro
         rata share of such interest,  and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph
         shall not be construed to apply to any payment  obtained by a Lender as
         consideration  for the assignment of or sale of a participation  in any
         of its Loans (or participations in LC Disbursements) to any assignee or
         participant,  other than to any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
         or  Affiliate  thereof (as to which the  provisions  of this  paragraph
         shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
         extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
         acquiring a participation  pursuant to the foregoing  arrangements  may
         exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and  counterclaim  with
         respect to such  participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
         creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  (f)  AGENT'S  ASSUMPTION  THAT  BORROWER  WILL MAKE  PAYMENTS.
         Unless the Agent shall have received  notice from the Borrower prior to
         the date on which any  payment  is due to the Agent for the  account of
         the Lenders or the Issuing  Lender  entitled  thereto (the  "APPLICABLE
         RECIPIENT") hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
         Agent may assume that the  Borrower  has made such payment on such date
         in  accordance  herewith  and may,  in reliance  upon such  assumption,
         distribute to the  Applicable  Recipient the amount due. In such event,
         if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Applicable
         Recipient  severally  agrees to repay to the Agent  forthwith on demand
         the amount so  distributed to such  Applicable  Recipient with interest
         thereon,  for each  day from and  including  the date  such  amount  is
         distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at
         the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (g) LENDER'S FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENT. If any Lender shall fail
         to make any payment  required to be made by it pursuant to  subsections
         2.4(d), 2.4(e), 2.5(c) or 2.7(d), then the Agent may, in its discretion
         (notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  hereof),  apply any amounts


                                       65

<PAGE>

         thereafter  received  by the  Agent or the  account  of such  Lender to
         satisfy such Lender's  obligations under such subsection until all such
         unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         2.8.  PREPAYMENT OF LOANS.

                  (a) OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS. The Borrower shall have the
         right at any time and from time to time to prepay the  Revolving  Loans
         in  whole or in  part,  subject  to prior  notice  in  accordance  with
         subsection  2.8(c) in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans,  and subject to the
         payment  of  any  amounts  due  under  subsection  2.3(e)  and,  if the
         Revolving  Credit  Commitment is  terminated,  subsection  2.6(d).  The
         Borrower  shall  have the  right  at any time and from  time to time to
         prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part,  subject  to prior  notice in
         accordance  with  subsection  2.8(c) and  subject to the payment of any
         amounts due under subsection  2.3(e) and, if the Term Loan is repaid in
         full,  subsection 2.6(d), and PROVIDED that each such prepayment of the
         Term Loan shall be in an amount  that is at least  equal to $500,000 or
         any greater multiple of $100,000.

                  (b) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall be obligated to,
         and shall,  make  prepayments  of the Loans  hereunder  (and reduce the
         Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder) as follows:

                           (i)   INCURRENCE  OF  DEBT.   Without   limiting  the
                  obligation  of the  Borrower  to  obtain  the  consent  of the
                  Required   Lenders  to  any  incurrence  of  Indebtedness  not
                  otherwise  permitted  hereunder,  the Borrower agrees,  on the
                  closing of any incurrence of  Indebtedness  by the Borrower or
                  any of its  Subsidiaries  (other than  Indebtedness  permitted
                  pursuant to Section  8.1) to prepay the Loans  hereunder  (and
                  provide cash  collateral for Total LC Exposure as specified in
                  subsection  2.4(h)),  and  the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments
                  hereunder  shall be subject to automatic  reduction,  upon the
                  date of  such  incurrence  of  Indebtedness,  in an  aggregate
                  amount  equal to 100% of the  amount of the Net Cash  Payments
                  from such incurrence of Indebtedness  received by the Borrower
                  and its  Subsidiaries,  such  prepayment  and  reduction to be
                  effected  in  each  case  in the  manner  and  to  the  extent
                  specified in subsection 2.8(c) below.

                           (ii) SALE OR OFFERING  OF  SECURITIES.  The  Borrower
                  agrees  on the  closing  of any  offering  or sale  of  equity
                  securities  by the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  to
                  prepay the Loans  hereunder  (and provide cash  collateral for
                  Total LC Exposure as specified in subsection 2.4(h)), upon the
                  date of such sale or offering of  securities,  in an aggregate
                  amount equal to 100% of the amount of Net Cash  Payments  from
                  such offering of  securities  received by the Borrower and its
                  Subsidiaries,  and such prepayment to be effected in each case
                  in the manner and to the extent specified in subsection 2.8(c)
                  below.

                           (iii) SALE OF ASSETS. Without limiting the obligation
                  of the Borrower or any Canadian  Borrower (as the case may be)


                                       66

                  to  obtain  the  consent  of  the  Required   Lenders  to  any
                  Disposition not otherwise  permitted  hereunder,  the Borrower
                  agrees,  on the date of any Disposition by the Borrower or any
                  of its Subsidiaries  (other than Dispositions  permitted under
                  (A) Section  8.4(b)(v) of assets not  comprising the Term Loan
                  Borrowing  Base or Canadian  Borrowing Base to the extent that
                  the  aggregate  Net Cash  Payments  received  therefrom do not
                  exceed  $500,000 and (B) Section  8.4(b)(vii)),  to prepay the

                  Disposition, be applied to prepay the Revolving Loans.

                           (iv) EXTRAORDINARY  RECEIPTS. Upon the receipt by any
                  Credit Party or any of its  Subsidiaries of any  Extraordinary

         2.10.  INCREASED COSTS.

                  (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i) impose,  modify or deem  applicable  any reserve,
                  special  deposit or  similar  requirement  against  assets of,
                  deposits  with or for the account of, or credit  extended  by,
                  any Lender or the Issuing Lender; or

                           (ii)  impose on any Lender or the  Issuing  Lender or
                  the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
                  Agreement  or LIBOR  Rate  Loans  made by such  Lender  or any
                  Letter of Credit or participation therein;

                  and the result of any of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase
         the cost to such  Lender of making or  maintaining  any LIBOR Rate Loan
         (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase
         the cost to such  Lender or the  Issuing  Lender of  participating  in,
         issuing or maintaining  any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of


                                       70

<PAGE>

         any sum  received or  receivable  by such Lender or the Issuing  Lender
         hereunder  (whether  of  principal,  interest or  otherwise),  then the
         Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may
         be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
         the  Issuing  Lender,  as the case may be,  for such  additional  costs
         incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Lender reasonably  determines
         that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have
         the  effect of  reducing  the rate of return  on such  Lender's  or the
         Issuing  Lender's  capital or on the  capital of such  Lender's  or the
         Issuing  Lender's  holding  company,  if any, as a consequence  of this
         Agreement or the Loans made by, or  participations in Letters of Credit
         held by, such  Lender,  or the Letters of Credit  issued by the Issuing
         Lender,  to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing  Lender
         or such  Lender's or the Issuing  Lender's  holding  company could have
         achieved  but for such Change in Law (taking  into  consideration  such
         Lender's  or the Issuing  Lender's  policies  and the  policies of such
         Lender's  or the  Issuing  Lender's  holding  company  with  respect to
         capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such
         Lender  or the  Issuing  Lender,  as the case may be,  such  additional
         amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender,
         or such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company,  for any such
         reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate  of a Lender or the Issuing  Lender  setting
         forth the amount or amounts  necessary to compensate such Lender or the
         Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
         in  subsections  2.10(a) or 2.10(b)  above  shall be  delivered  to the
         Borrower  and shall be  conclusive  so long as it reflects a reasonable
         basis for the calculation of the amounts set forth therein and does not
         contain any manifest  error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the
         Issuing Lender the amount shown as due on any such  certificate  within
         10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
         Lender to demand  compensation  pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall not
         constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing  Lender's  right to
         demand  such  compensation;  PROVIDED  that the  Borrower  shall not be
         required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender  pursuant to this
         Section 2.10 for any increased  costs or reductions  incurred more than
         six months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as
         the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise
         to such  increased  costs or  reductions  and of such  Lender's  or the
         Issuing Lender's  intention to claim  compensation  therefor;  PROVIDED
         further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased  costs
         or  reductions  is  (i)  retroactive  and  (ii)  occurred  within  such
         six-month  period,  then the six-month  period referred to above may be
         extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof, but in no
         event any period prior to the Closing Date.

         2.11.  TAXES; SETOFF; ETC.

         additional sums payable under this Section 2.11) the Agent,  any Lender
         or the Issuing  Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
         the sum it would have received had no such  deductions  been made, (ii)
         the Borrower or such Canadian  Borrower shall make such  deductions and
         (iii) the Borrower or such Canadian  Borrower shall pay the full amount

         written demand therefor,  for the full amount of any Indemnified  Taxes
         or Other Taxes (including  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
         asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.11)
         paid by the Agent,  such Lender or the Issuing Lender,  as the case may
         be  (and  any  penalties,  interest  and  reasonable  expenses  arising
         therefrom  or with  respect  thereto  during  the  period  prior to the
         Borrower  or such  Canadian  Borrower,  as the case may be  making  the
         payment  demanded  under  this  paragraph  (c)),  whether  or not  such
         Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally  imposed or
         asserted by the relevant  Governmental  Authority.  A certificate as to
         the amount of such  payment or  liability  delivered to the Borrower or
         any  Canadian  Borrower,  as the case may be by a Lender or the Issuing
         Lender,  or by the Agent on its own  behalf or on behalf of a Lender or
         the Issuing Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as  practicable  after any payment of  Indemnified
         Taxes or Other  Taxes by the  Borrower  or any  Canadian  Borrower to a
         Governmental  Authority,  the Borrower or such Canadian  Borrower shall
         deliver  to the Agent the  original  or a  certified  copy of a receipt
         issued by such Governmental  Authority  evidencing such payment, a copy
         of the return  reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
         reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign  Lender that is entitled to an exemption  from
         or  reduction of  withholding  tax under the law of a  jurisdiction  in
         which the Borrower or any Canadian  Borrower is located,  or any treaty
         to which such  jurisdiction is a party,  with respect to payments under
         this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower or such Canadian  Borrower
         (with  a copy  to the  Agent),  at the  time  or  times  prescribed  by


                                       72

<PAGE>

         applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or such Canadian
         Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed
         by  applicable  law as will  permit such  payments  to be made  without
         withholding or at a reduced rate.

         2.12.  MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

                  (a) DESIGNATION OF A DIFFERENT  LENDING OFFICE.  If any Lender
         requests  compensation  under  Section  2.10,  or if  the  Borrower  is
         required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
         Authority for the account of any Lender  pursuant to Section 2.11, then
         such  Lender  shall use  reasonable  efforts to  designate  a different
         lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder, or to assign
         its  rights  and  obligations  hereunder  to  another  of its  offices,
         branches  or  Affiliates,  if, in the  judgment  of such  Lender,  such
         designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable
         pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.11, as the case may be, in the future and
         (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
         expense and would not otherwise be  disadvantageous to such Lender. The
         Borrower  hereby  agrees  to pay  all  reasonable  costs  and  expenses
         incurred  by any  Lender in  connection  with any such  designation  or
         assignment.

                  (b)   REPLACEMENT   OF   LENDERS.   If  any  Lender   requests
         compensation  under Section 2.10, or if any Borrower is required to pay
         any additional  amount to any Lender or any Governmental  Authority for
         the account of any Lender  pursuant to Section  2.11,  or if any Lender
         defaults in its obligation to fund Loans  hereunder,  then the Borrower
         may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
         Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
         accordance  with and subject to the  restrictions  contained in Section
         11.4, all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
         an assignee that shall assume such  obligations  (which assignee may be
         another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); PROVIDED that (i)
         the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Agent
         and the  Issuing  Lender,  which  consents  shall not  unreasonably  be
         withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
         amount   equal  to  the   outstanding   principal  of  its  Loans  (and
         participations in LC Disbursements),  accrued interest thereon, accrued
         fees and all other amounts  payable to it hereunder,  from the assignee
         (to the extent of such  outstanding  principal and accrued interest and
         fees) or the Borrower  (in the case of all other  amounts) and (iii) in
         the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
         under Section 2.10 or payments  required to be made pursuant to Section
         2.11, such  assignment will result in a reduction in such  compensation
         or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment
         and  delegation  if,  prior  thereto,  as a result  of a waiver by such
         Lender or  otherwise,  the  circumstances  entitling  the  Borrower  to
         require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

         2.13. CHANGE IN DOMESTIC  BORROWING BASE,  CANADIAN  BORROWING BASE AND
TERM LOAN BORROWING BASE. The Domestic Borrowing Base and the Canadian Borrowing
Base shall be determined  monthly (or at such other interval as may be specified


                                       73

<PAGE>

pursuant to  subsection  7.1) by the Agent by  reference to the  Borrowing  Base
Certificate,  commercial  finance and collateral  audit reports,  the Collateral
Update Certificate or Accounts  Receivable/Loan  Reconciliation Report delivered
to the  Lenders  and the Agent  pursuant  to  subsection  7.1(g).  The Term Loan
Borrowing  Base shall be determined  from time to time by the Agent by reference
to the  appraisals  or  reappraisals  of Eligible  Fixed Assets or Real Property
Assets  delivered  to the Lenders  and the Agent  pursuant  to  subsection  7.1,
respectively  and other  information  obtained by or provided to the Agent.  The
Agent shall give to the  Borrower  written  notice of any change in the Domestic
Borrowing Base, Canadian Borrowing Base or Term Loan Borrowing Base, as the case
may be determined by the Agent.  Such notice shall be effective upon its receipt
by the Borrower.

         2.14  CANADIAN FACILITY.

                  (a) On, and from time to time  after,  the Closing  Date,  the
         Agent  shall,  subject to the terms and  conditions  set forth  herein,
         cause the Issuing  Lender to issue for the account of the  Borrower and
         the Canadian  Borrowers,  and for the benefit of the Canadian Lender, a
         letter of credit (the "CANADIAN LETTER OF CREDIT") in the original face
         amount of $6,000,000  U.S.  Dollars or the Canadian  Dollar  equivalent
         thereof  (the  "CANADIAN  SUBLIMIT").  The face amount of the  Canadian
         Letter of Credit and the  Canadian  Sublimit are subject to change from
         time upon the  agreement  of the  Borrower,  the Agent and the  Issuing
         Lender; PROVIDED however, the Canadian Sublimit may not be increased by
         more than $2,000,000 without the prior consent of the Required Lenders.

                  (b) The  Canadian  Lender  and the  Canadian  Borrowers  shall
         execute  and deliver a  commitment  letter  (the  "CANADIAN  COMMITMENT
         LETTER"),  pursuant to which the Canadian Lender shall agree to lend to
         the Canadian Borrowers and the Canadian Borrowers may borrow, repay and
         reborrow  from time to time  between the Closing  Date and the Maturity
         Date upon notice pursuant to the Canadian  Commitment Letter, such sums
         as are  requested by the Canadian  Borrowers up to a maximum  aggregate
         amount  outstanding  (after giving effect to all amounts  requested) at
         any one time equal to Canadian  Sublimit;  PROVIDED  that (after giving
         effect to all  amounts  requested  under  the  Canadian  Facility)  the
         Domestic  Revolving  Credit  Exposure  plus the Canadian  Excess Amount
         shall not at any time exceed the Domestic Gross Availability. The Agent
         shall have the right pursuant to the Canadian Commitment Letter and the
         Canadian Intercreditor  Agreement to limit from time to time the amount
         of loans and other  extensions  of credit  which may be advanced by the
         Canadian Lender to the Canadian Borrowers.

                  (c) The  Obligations of the Canadian  Borrowers to the Issuing
         Lender,  the Agent and the Lenders in respect of the Canadian Letter of
         Credit,  shall be (i)  guaranteed  by the Borrower  and the  Guarantors
         pursuant to the Guarantee and (ii) secured by a First  Priority Lien in
         favor of the Agent,  for the benefit of the  Lenders and the Agent,  on
         all  tangible  and  intangible  property  and  assets of such  Canadian

<PAGE>

         Borrowers, wherever located, whether now owned or existing or hereafter
         acquired or arising,  together with any and all  additions  thereto and
         replacements therefor and proceeds and products thereof, as further set
         forth in the Canadian Loan Documents.

                                   ARTICLE 3.

                             GUARANTEE BY GUARANTORS

         3.1. THE GUARANTEE. The Guarantors hereby guarantee to each Lender, the
Issuing  Lender and the Agent and their  respective  successors  and assigns the
prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity,  by acceleration or
otherwise) as well as the performance, of all of the Obligations. The Guarantors
hereby further agree that if the Borrower or any Canadian Borrower,  as the case
may be,  shall  fail to pay in full when due  (whether  at stated  maturity,  by
acceleration  or otherwise) or perform any of its  Obligations,  the  Guarantors
will promptly pay or perform the same,  without any demand or notice whatsoever,
all of which are  expressly  waived by the Guarantor and that in the case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will
be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration
or  otherwise)  or perform in  accordance  with the terms of such  extension  or
renewal.  Payments by the  Guarantors  hereunder may be required by the Agent on
any number of occasions.

         3.2. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of the Guarantors under
Section  3.1  are  absolute  and   unconditional   irrespective  of  the  value,
genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement, the other
Loan  Documents  or any other  agreement  or  instrument  referred  to herein or
therein,  or any substitution,  release or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the  Obligations,  and, to the fullest  extent  permitted by
applicable  law,  irrespective of any other  circumstance  whatsoever that might
otherwise  constitute a legal or  equitable  discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor,  it being the intent of this Section 3.2 that the  obligations of the
Guarantors  hereunder  shall be  absolute  and  unconditional  under any and all
circumstances.  Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  it is agreed
that the  occurrence  of any one or more of the  following  shall  not  alter or
impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

                  (i) at any time or from time to time,  without  notice to such
         Guarantors, the time for any performance of, place or manner of payment
         or  compliance  with  any  of  the   Obligations   shall  be  extended,
         compromised,  renewed, modified or such performance or compliance shall
         be waived, as the case may be;

                  (ii)  the  maturity  of  any  of  the  Obligations   shall  be
         accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified,  supplemented
         or amended in any  respect,  or any right  hereunder or under the other
         Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument  referred to herein
         or  therein  shall  be  waived  or any  other  guarantee  of any of the


                                       75

<PAGE>

         Obligations or any security  therefor shall be released or exchanged in
         whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (iii) the adequacy of any rights which the Agent or any Lender
         may have  against any  collateral  security or other means of obtaining
         repayment of any of the Obligations;

                  (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of,
         the Agent,  the Issuing Lender or any Lender or Lenders as security for
         any of the Obligations shall fail to be perfected, any rights which the
         Agent,  the Issuing  Lender or any Lender or Lenders might have in such
         Collateral  shall  have  failed to be  preserved  or any  substitution,
         exchange,   surrender,   release,  loss  or  destruction  of  any  such
         collateral security;

                  (v) the  addition,  substitution  or  release of any entity or
         other Person  primarily or secondarily  liable for any  Obligation;  or
         (vi) any act or  omission  which  might in any  manner or to any extent
         vary the risk of such  Guarantor or  otherwise  operate as a release or
         discharge of such Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to
         such Guarantor.

         The  Guarantors   hereby   expressly   waive   promptness,   diligence,
presentment,  demand  of  payment,  protest  and  all  notices  whatsoever,  any
requirement  that the Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender exhaust any right,
power or remedy  or  proceed  against  the  Borrower  or any  Canadian  Borrower
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument
referred  to herein or  therein,  or against  any other  Person  under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations and all defenses which may
be available by virtue of any valuation,  stay,  moratorium law or other similar
law now or hereafter in effect. The Guarantors expressly and knowingly waive all
suretyship  defenses  which might  otherwise  accrue  without their  Obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

         To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives any and all rights or defenses  arising by reason of (A) any "one action"
or  "anti-deficiency"  law which would otherwise prevent the Agent or any Lender
from bringing any action,  including  any claim for a deficiency,  or exercising
any  other  right or  remedy  (including  any right of  set-off),  against  such
Guarantor  before  or  after  the  Agent's  or  such  Lender's  commencement  or
completion of any foreclosure action,  whether judicially,  by exercise of power
of sale or  otherwise,  or (B) any  other  law  which  in any  other  way  would
otherwise require any election of remedies by the Agent or any Lender.

         3.3.  REINSTATEMENT.  The  obligations  of the  Guarantors  under  this
Article 3 shall be  automatically  reinstated  if and to the extent that for any
reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any  Canadian  Borrower in
respect of its  Obligations  is rescinded  or must be otherwise  restored by any
holder of any of its  Obligations,  whether  as a result of any  proceedings  in


                                       76

<PAGE>

bankruptcy or  reorganization  or otherwise,  and each Guarantor  agrees that it
will  indemnify the Agent,  the Issuing Lender and each Lender on demand for all
reasonable costs and expenses  (including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred
by the  Agent,  any  Lender  or the  Issuing  Lender  in  connection  with  such
rescission or  restoration,  including  any such costs and expenses  incurred in
defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference,
fraudulent  transfer or similar  payment  under any  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or
similar law.

         3.4.  SUBROGATION.  Until such time as the Obligations  shall have been
indefeasibly  paid in full, each of the Guarantors shall not exercise and hereby
waives all rights of subrogation,  reimbursement,  restitution,  contribution or
otherwise  whether arising by contract or operation of law  (including,  without
limitation, any such right arising under the Federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as
amended) or by reason of any payment by it  pursuant to the  provisions  of this
Article 3 and further  agrees with the Borrower and the Canadian  Borrowers  for
the  benefit  of  each  creditor  of the  Borrower  and the  Canadian  Borrowers
(including,  without limitation,  the Agent, the Issuing Lender and each Lender)
that any such payment by it shall  constitute a contribution  of capital by such
Guarantor to the Borrower or the  Canadian  Borrowers,  as the case may be. Each
Guarantor will not prove any claim in  competition  with the Agent or any Lender
in  respect  of  any  payment   hereunder  in  any  bankruptcy,   insolvency  or
reorganization  case or  proceedings  of any nature.  The  Guarantors  waive any
benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral  security which may be
held by the Agent or any Lender.

         3.5. REMEDIES. The Guarantors agree that, as between the Guarantors and
the  Lenders,  the  Obligations  of the Borrower  and/or the Canadian  Borrowers
hereunder may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section
9.1 (and shall be deemed to have  become  automatically  due and  payable in the
circumstances   provided   in  Section   9.1)  for   purposes   of  Section  3.1
notwithstanding  any  stay,  injunction  or other  prohibition  preventing  such
declaration (or such Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as
against the  Borrower or any Canadian  Borrower  and that,  in the event of such
declaration (or such Obligations  being deemed to have become  automatically due
and payable),  such Obligations  (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower
or any Canadian  Borrower) shall forthwith become immediately due and payable by
the Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.1.

         3.6. INSTRUMENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY. Each of the Guarantors hereby
acknowledges  that the guarantee in this Article 3 constitutes an instrument for
the  payment of money,  and  consents  and agrees  that the Agent,  the  Issuing
Lender,  or any Lender,  at its sole  option,  in the event of a dispute by such
Guarantor  in the payment of any moneys due  hereunder,  shall have the right to
summary  judgment or such other  expedited  procedure as may be available  for a
suit on a note or other instrument for the payment of money.

         3.7.  CONTINUING  GUARANTEE.  The  guarantee  in  this  Article  3 is a
continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.

         3.8 GENERAL  LIMITATION  ON AMOUNT OF  OBLIGATIONS  GUARANTEED.  In any
         action or proceeding involving any state or non-U.S.  corporate law, or
         any state or Federal or non-U.S. bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
         or other law  affecting  the  rights  of  creditors  generally,  if the
         obligations of the Guarantors under Section 3.1 would otherwise be held
         or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable,  or subordinated to
         the  claims of any other  creditors,  on  account  of the amount of its
         liability  under Section 3.1 or if such  obligations  under Section 3.1
         would constitute or result in a violation of any applicable  fraudulent
         conveyance  or  similar  law  of  any  relevant   jurisdiction,   then,
         notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary,  the amount
         of such liability shall,  without any further action by the Guarantors,
         any Lender, Agent or other Person, be automatically limited and reduced
         to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and, as applicable,
         not be  subordinated  to the claims of other creditors as determined in
         such action or proceeding.

                                   ARTICLE 4.

         Agent and with respect to which the Agent has received  waiver  letters
         from all landlords,  warehousemen  and processors in form and substance
         acceptable to the Agent.

                  (c) Each Credit Party  represents  and warrants to the Lenders
         and the Agent as follows:  (i) except for the security interest created
         by this  Agreement  and other Liens  permitted  hereunder,  there is no
         financing statement,  security agreement, chattel mortgage, real estate
         mortgage or other document  filed or recorded with any filing  records,
         registry or other public office, that purports to cover, affect or give

         of the Credit Parties or any rights relating thereto,  (ii) such Credit
         Party is the owner of or has other  rights in or power to transfer  the
         Collateral,  free from any right or claim of any Person or any  adverse
         lien,  except for the security  interest  created by this Agreement and
         other  Liens  permitted   hereunder,   (iii)  none  of  the  Collateral

         inss.9-102(a)(34)  of the MA UCC,  (iv) none of the account  debtors or
         other  Persons  obligated on any of the  Collateral  is a  Governmental

         that,  such  Credit  Party  shall  defend its rights in the  Collateral
         against all claims and demands of all Persons at any time  claiming the
         same  or any  interests  therein  adverse  to the  Agent  or any of the

                  (e) Each Credit Party  represents  and warrants to the Lenders
         and the Agent that all  filings,  assignments,  pledges and deposits of
         documents or instruments have been made and all other actions have been
         taken  that are  necessary  or  advisable,  under  applicable  law,  to
         establish and perfect the Agent's security  interest in the Collateral.
         The  Collateral  and the Agent's  rights with respect to the Collateral
         are not subject to any setoff, claims, withholdings or other defenses.

                  (f) Except for  Collateral  that is obsolete or no longer used
         in their business,  the Credit Parties will keep the Collateral in good
         order and repair  (normal wear  excepted)  and will not use the same in
         violation  of law or any  policy  of  insurance  thereon  and  keep the
         Collateral  adequately  insured  at all  times in  accordance  with the
         provisions  of Section 7.5. The Credit  Parties will pay promptly  when
         due all taxes,  assessments,  governmental  charges and levies upon the
         Collateral  or  for  its  use  or  operation,   except  for  taxes  and
         assessments  permitted  to be  contested  as provided  in Section  7.4.
         Following  the  occurrence  and during the  continuance  of an Event of
         Default,  the Agent may at its option  discharge  any taxes or Liens to
         which any  Collateral  is at any time  subject  (other  than  Permitted
         Liens),  and may,  upon the  failure of the Credit  Parties to do so in
         accordance  with this Agreement,  purchase  insurance on any Collateral
         and pay for the repair,  maintenance or preservation  thereof, and each
         Credit Party  agrees to reimburse  the Agent on demand for any payments
         or  expenses  incurred  by the  Agent or the  Lenders  pursuant  to the
         foregoing  authorization and any unreimbursed  amounts shall constitute
         Obligations for all purposes hereof.

                  (g) The Agent may from time to time  request  and each  Credit
         Party shall deliver copies of all customer lists and vendor lists.

                  (h) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent,
         at any  time  and  from  time to  time,  to  file  in any  jurisdiction
         financing  statements  and  amendments  thereto  that (i)  indicate the
         Collateral  (x) as all assets of such Credit  Party or words of similar
         effect,  regardless  of whether any  particular  asset falls within the
         scope of Article 9 of the MA UCC or such other  jurisdiction  or (y) as
         being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail and (ii) which
         contain  any  other  information  required  by  Article 9 of the MA UCC
         (including  Part 5  thereof)  for  the  sufficiency  or  filing  office
         acceptance of any financing  statement or amendment,  including whether
         (A) any Credit Party is an  organization,  the type of organization and
         any organization  identification number issued to such Credit Party and
         (B) in the case of a financing  statement  filed as a fixture filing or
         indicating Collateral as as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, a
         sufficient  description  of the real  property to which the  Collateral
         relates.  The Credit  Parties agree to furnish any such  information to
         the Agent  promptly upon  request.  Each Credit Party also ratifies its
         authorization  for the Agent to have  filed in any  Uniform  Commercial
         Code jurisdiction any like initial  financing  statements or amendments
         thereto if filed prior to the Closing Date.


                                       81

<PAGE>

                  (i) Each Credit  Party agrees that it will join with the Agent
         in  executing  and, at its own expense  file and refile,  or permit the
         Agent  to file  and  refile  such  financing  statements,  continuation
         statements and other documents (including,  without limitation,  Patent
         Agreements,  Trademark Agreements,  Copyright Mortgages and licenses to
         use  software  and other  property  protected  by  copyright),  in such
         offices  (including,  without  limitation,  the PTO, the United  States
         Copyright Office, and appropriate state patent, trademark and copyright
         offices),  as the Agent may reasonably  deem necessary or  appropriate,
         wherever required or permitted by law, in order to perfect and preserve
         the rights and interests  granted to the Agent in the Collateral.  Each
         Credit Party will give the Agent notice of each office at which records
         of such Credit Party  pertaining to all intangible  items of Collateral
         are  kept.  Except  as may be  provided  in such  notice,  the  records
         concerning  all  intangible  Collateral  are  and  will  be kept at the
         address shown in the respective Perfection  Certificate for such Credit
         Party as the principal place of business of such Credit Party.

                  (j) The Credit  Parties are the sole and  exclusive  owners of
         the websites and domain names listed on SCHEDULE 4.2(J) hereto and have
         registered  such domain  names with all  applicable  authorities  which
         provides  for the  exclusive  use by the Credit  Parties of such domain
         names.  The websites do not contain any material,  the  publication  of
         which may result in (a) the  violation of rights of any Person or (b) a
         right of any  Person  against  the  publisher  or  distributor  of such
         material.

                  (k) The Credit Parties shall, annually by the end of the first
         fiscal  quarter  following the previous  fiscal year,  provide  written
         notice to the Agent of all  applications  for  registration of Patents,
         Trademarks or Copyrights,  to the extent such applications  exist, made
         during the preceding  calendar  year. The Credit Parties shall file and
         prosecute  diligently all  applications  for  registration  of Patents,
         Trademarks  or  Copyrights  now or  hereafter  pending  that  would  be
         necessary  to the  business  of the  Credit  Parties  to which any such
         applications  pertain,  and  to do all  acts,  in  any  such  instance,
         necessary  to  preserve  and  maintain  all  rights in such  registered
         Patents,  Trademarks or Copyrights  unless such Patents,  Trademarks or
         Copyrights are not material to the business of the Credit  Parties,  as
         reasonably determined by the Credit Parties consistent with prudent and
         commercially  reasonable  business  practices.  Any and all  costs  and
         expenses incurred in connection with any such actions shall be borne by
         the Credit Parties.  Except in accordance with prudent and commercially
         reasonable business practices, the Credit Parties shall not abandon any
         right to file a  Patent,  Trademark  or  Copyright  application  or any
         pending  Patent,  Trademark or Copyright  application or any registered
         Patent,  Trademark or Copyright, in each case material to its business,
         without the consent of the Agent.

                  (l) The domain name servers used in connection with the domain
         names  of  the  Credit  Parties  and  all  other  relevant  information
         pertaining to such domain names, and the  administrative  contacts used
         in connection with the registration of such domain names are identified


                                       82

<PAGE>

         on SCHEDULE  4.2 hereto.  No Credit  Party will change such domain name
         servers  without 10 days' prior written notice to the Agent.  No Credit
         Party  will  cause  a  change  in  the  identity  of  any  domain  name
         administrative  contact  without 10 days' prior  written  notice to the
         Agent.

                  (m) If any Credit  Party is, now or at any time  hereafter,  a
         beneficiary  under a letter of  credit in the face  amount in excess of
         $100,000,  such Credit Party shall  promptly  notify the Agent  thereof
         and, at the request and option of the Agent,  such Credit  Party shall,
         pursuant to an  agreement  in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the
         Agent,  either (i)  arrange for the issuer and any  confirmer  or other
         nominated  Person of such letter of credit to consent to an  assignment
         to the Agent of the  proceeds  of the letter of credit or (ii)  arrange
         for the Agent to become  the  transferee  beneficiary  of the letter of
         credit, with the Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of the
         letter of credit are to be applied by the Agent against the Obligations
         as provided in this Agreement.

                  (n) To the extent any Credit Party  shall,  now or at any time
         hereafter,  hold or acquire any promissory note or other  instrument or
         tangible  chattel paper (the principal  amount of which is greater than
         $100,000),  such Credit Party will promptly  notify the Lender  thereof
         and, at the request and option of the Lender, such Debtor will endorse,
         assign and deliver such promissory note or other instrument or tangible
         chattel  paper  to the  Lender  to be  held  as  Collateral  hereunder,
         together  with such  instruments  of  transfer  or  assignment  thereof
         reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Lender.

                  (o) If any Credit Party shall,  now or at any time  hereafter,
         hold or acquire any  certificated  securities,  such Credit Party shall
         forthwith   endorse,   assign  and  deliver  the  same  to  the  Agent,
         accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed
         in blank as the Agent may from time to time specify; PROVIDED, however,
         except with respect to entities which are disregarded entities for U.S.
         income tax  purposes,  such  Credit  Party  shall only be  required  to
         endorse,  assign and deliver  shares  representing  sixty-five  percent
         (65%) of the Capital Stock of such Credit  Party's  first-tier  Foreign
         Subsidiaries. If any securities now or hereafter acquired by any Credit
         Party are  uncertificated  and are issued to such  Credit  Party or its
         nominee  directly  by the  issuer  thereof,  such  Credit  Party  shall
         promptly  notify the Agent  thereof  and,  at the  Agent's  request and
         option,  pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
         the  Agent,  either  (i)  cause the  issuer to agree to comply  without
         further consent of such Credit Party or such nominee,  at any time with
         instructions from the Agent as to such securities,  or (ii) arrange for
         the Agent to become  the  registered  owner of the  securities.  If any
         securities, whether certificated or uncertificated, or other investment
         property now or hereafter acquired by any Credit Party are held by such
         Credit  Party or its  nominee  through  a  securities  intermediary  or
         commodity  intermediary,  such Credit Party shall  promptly  notify the
         Agent  thereof and, at the Agent's  request and option,  pursuant to an
         agreement in form and substance  satisfactory to the Agent,  either (A)


                                       83

<PAGE>

         cause such  securities  intermediary  or (as the case may be) commodity
         intermediary  to agree to comply,  in each case without further consent
         of such  Credit  Party or such  nominee,  at any time with  entitlement
         orders  or  other  instructions  from  the  Agent  to  such  securities
         intermediary as to such securities or other investment property, or (as
         the case may be) to apply  any  value  distributed  on  account  of any
         commodity   contract  as  directed  by  the  Agent  to  such  commodity
         intermediary,  or  (B)  in  the  case  of  financial  assets  or  other
         investment property held through a securities intermediary, arrange for
         the  Agent to  become  the  entitlement  holder  with  respect  to such
         investment property, with such Credit Party being permitted,  only with
         the consent of the Agent,  to exercise  rights to withdraw or otherwise
         deal with such investment  property.  The Agent agrees with each Credit
         Party  that the  Agent  shall not give any such  entitlement  orders or
         instructions or directions to any such issuer,  securities intermediary
         or  commodity  intermediary,  and shall not withhold its consent to the
         exercise of any  withdrawal  or dealing  rights by such  Credit  Party,
         unless an Event of Default has  occurred and is  continuing,  or, after
         giving  effect  to  any  such  investment  and  withdrawal  rights  not
         otherwise permitted by the Loan Documents,  would occur. The provisions
         of this paragraph shall not apply to any financial assets credited to a
         securities account for which the Agent is the securities intermediary.

                  (p) For each deposit account or other accounts that any Credit
         Party,  now or at any time hereafter,  opens or maintains (other than a
         deposit  account  for  which the Agent is the  depositary  bank),  such
         Credit Party shall, at the Agent's  request and option,  pursuant to an
         agreement in form and substance  satisfactory to the Agent,  either (i)
         cause the  depositary  bank or such  Person to agree to comply  without
         further  consent of such Credit  Party,  at any time with  instructions
         from the Agent to such  depositary  bank or such Person  directing  the
         disposition  of funds  from  time to time  credited  to or held in such
         deposit  account or other account,  as the case may be, or (ii) arrange
         for the Agent to become the  customer of the  depositary  bank or other
         Person with respect to the deposit account or other account,  with such
         Credit Party being  permitted,  only with the consent of the Agent,  to
         exercise  rights to withdraw  funds from such deposit  account or other
         account.  The  provisions  of this  paragraph  shall not apply to (A) a
         deposit  account for which the Agent is in automatic  control,  (B) any
         deposit accounts  specially and exclusively  used for payroll,  payroll
         taxes  and  other  employee  wage and  benefit  payments  to or for the
         benefit of such  Credit  Party's  salaried  employees,  (C) the deposit
         accounts or other accounts listed on SCHEDULE  4.2(P),  and (D) deposit
         accounts or local bank  accounts not subject to the Agent's  control so
         long as (x) the aggregate  amount of funds on deposit in all such local
         bank accounts does not exceed $500,000, and (y) the aggregate amount of
         funds on  deposit  in any  such  local  bank  account  does not  exceed
         $50,000.

                  (q) No Credit  Party  holds any  commercial  tort  claims,  as
         defined  in  Article  9 of the  MA  UCC,  except  as  indicated  in the
         Perfection Certificates. If any of the Credit Parties shall at any time
         acquire a  commercial  tort  claim,  such Credit  Party shall  promptly
         notify the Lender in a writing signed by such Credit Party of the brief
         details  thereof  and grant to the  Lender in such  writing a  security


                                       84

<PAGE>

         interest  therein and in the  proceeds  thereof,  all upon the terms of
         this  Agreement,  with  such  writing  to  be  in  form  and  substance
         reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.

                  (r) If any Collateral is, now or at any time hereafter, in the
         possession of a bailee,  the Credit Parties shall  promptly  notify the
         Agent thereof and, at the Agent's  request and option,  shall  promptly
         obtain  an  acknowledgement  from the  bailee,  in form  and  substance
         satisfactory  to the Agent,  that the bailee holds such  Collateral for
         the benefit of the Agent and such bailee's agreement to comply, without
         further consent of such Credit Party, at any time with  instructions of
         the Agent as to such  Collateral.  The Agent  agrees  with each  Credit
         Party  that the Agent  shall not give any such  instructions  unless an
         Event of Default has  occurred and is  continuing  or would occur after
         taking into account any action by such Credit Party with respect to the
         bailee.

                  (s) If any Credit Party,  now or at any time hereafter,  holds
         or  acquires  an  interest  in  any  electronic  chattel  paper  or any
         "transferable  record,"  as that term is defined in Section  201 of the
         federal  Electronic  Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or
         inss.16 of the Uniform Electronic  Transactions Act as in effect in any
         relevant  jurisdiction,  such Credit  Party shall  promptly  notify the
         Agent  thereof and, at the request and option of the Agent,  shall take
         such  action as the Agent may  reasonably  request to vest in the Agent
         control,  underss.9-105 of the MA UCC, of such electronic chattel paper
         or control  under Section 201 of the federal  Electronic  Signatures in
         Global and  National  Commerce Act or, as the case may be, ss.16 of the
         Uniform   Electronic   Transactions  Act,  as  so  in  effect  in  such
         jurisdiction,  of such transferable  record. The Agent agrees with each
         Credit  Party  that the Agent  will  arrange,  pursuant  to  procedures
         satisfactory  to the  Agent  and so long as such  procedures  will  not
         result in the Agent's  loss of control,  for such Credit  Party to make
         alterations  to the  electronic  chattel paper or  transferable  record
         permitted under  UCCss.9-105 or, as the case may be, Section 201 of the
         federal  Electronic  Signatures  in Global and  National  Commerce  Act
         orss.16 of the Uniform Electronic  Transactions Act, unless an Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking into
         account any action by such Credit Party with respect to such electronic
         chattel paper or transferable record.

                  (t) If any Credit Party has accounts  receivable in respect of
         which the account  debtor is located in Minnesota,  the Credit  Parties
         represent  and warrant that the  applicable  Credit Party has filed and
         shall file all  legally-required  Notice of Business Activities Reports
         and comparable reports with the appropriate Governmental Authorities.

                  (u) Each Credit Party further agrees,  upon the request of the
         Agent and at the Agent's  option,  to take any and all other actions as
         the Agent may  determine to be necessary or useful for the  attachment,
         perfection  and first  priority  of,  and the  ability  of the Agent to
         enforce,   the  Agent's  security  interest  in  any  and  all  of  the
         Collateral,  including,  without limitation, (i) executing,  delivering


                                       85

<PAGE>

         and,  where  appropriate,  filing  financing  statements and amendments
         relating  thereto,  certificates  and other documents or instruments as
         may be  necessary  to enable  the Agent to perfect or from time to time
         renew  the  security  interest  granted  hereby  or by any  other  Loan
         Document  under the MA UCC,  to the  extent,  if any,  that such Credit
         Party's  signature  thereon is required  therefor,  including,  without
         limitation,   such  financing   statements   and  amendments   thereto,
         certificates  and other  documents  as may be  necessary  to  perfect a
         security interest in any additional  Collateral  hereafter  acquired by
         such Credit  Party or in any  replacements  or proceeds  thereof,  (ii)
         causing  the  Agent's  name  to  be  noted  as  secured  party  on  any
         certificate  of title for a titled good if such notation is a condition
         to  attachment,  perfection  or priority of, or ability of the Agent to
         enforce,  the  Agent's  security  interest  in such  Collateral,  (iii)
         complying  with any  provision of any statute,  regulation or treaty of
         the  United  States  as to  any  Collateral  if  compliance  with  such
         provision is a condition to  attachment,  perfection or priority of, or
         ability of the Agent to enforce,  the Agent's security interest in such
         Collateral,  (iv) obtaining governmental and other third party waivers,
         consents  and  approvals,  in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the
         Agent,  including,  without  limitation,  any consent of any  licensor,
         lessor or other Person obligated on Collateral,  (v) obtaining  waivers
         from mortgagees and landlords in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Agent and (vi) taking all actions under any earlier  versions of the MA
         UCC or under any other law, as reasonably determined by the Agent to be
         applicable in any relevant MA UCC or other jurisdiction,  including any
         foreign jurisdiction.

                  (v) Each Credit  Party  authorizes  and appoints the Agent and
         any officer or agent thereof,  with full power of substitution,  as its
         true and  lawful  attorney-in-fact  with  full  irrevocable  power  and
         authority in the place and stead of such Credit Party or in the Agent's
         own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this  Agreement,
         to take  any and all  appropriate  action  and to  execute  any and all
         documents and instruments that may be necessary or useful to accomplish
         the purposes of this Agreement and,  without limiting the generality of
         the  foregoing,  hereby gives said  attorneys  the power and right,  on
         behalf of such Credit Party, without notice to or assent by such Credit
         Party,  to do the  following:  (i) upon the  occurrence  and during the
         continuance  of an  Event of  Default,  generally  to  sell,  transfer,
         pledge,  make any agreement with respect to or otherwise  dispose of or
         deal with any of the  Collateral in such manner as is  consistent  with
         the MA UCC and as fully and  completely  as though  the Agent  were the
         absolute  owner  thereof  for all  purposes,  and to do, at the  Credit
         Parties'  expense,  at any  time,  or from  time to time,  all acts and
         things which the Agent deems  necessary or useful to protect,  preserve
         or  realize  upon the  Collateral  and the  Agent's  security  interest
         therein,  in order to effect the intent of this Agreement,  all no less
         fully and effectively as any Credit Party might do, including,  without
         limitation, (A) the filing and prosecuting of registration and transfer
         applications with the appropriate  federal,  state or local agencies or
         authorities  with  respect to  trademarks,  copyrights  and  patentable
         inventions and processes, (B) upon written notice to such Credit Party,
         the exercise of voting rights with respect to voting securities,  which


                                       86

<PAGE>

         rights may be exercised, if the Agent so elects, with a view to causing
         the  liquidation of assets of the issuer of any such securities and (C)
         the execution,  delivery and recording,  in connection with any sale or
         other disposition of any Collateral,  of the endorsements,  assignments
         or other  instruments  of  conveyance  or transfer with respect to such
         Collateral;   and  (ii)  to  the  extent  that  such   Credit   Party's
         authorization  given in this subsection 4.2 (v) is not  sufficient,  to
         file such financing  statements  with respect  hereto,  with or without
         such Credit  Party's  signature,  or a photocopy  of this  Agreement in
         substitution  for  a  financing  statement,   as  the  Agent  may  deem
         appropriate  and to execute in such Credit  Party's name such financing
         statements and amendments thereto and continuation statements which may
         require such Credit Party's signature.  To the extent permitted by law,
         each  Credit  Party  hereby  ratifies  all that  said  attorneys  shall
         lawfully  do or  cause  to be done by  virtue  hereof.  This  power  of
         attorney is a power  coupled with an interest and is  irrevocable.  The
         powers  conferred  on the Agent  hereunder  are solely to  protect  the
         interests of the Agent and the Lenders in the  Collateral and shall not
         impose any duty upon the Agent to exercise any such  powers.  The Agent
         shall be accountable only for the amounts that it actually  receives as
         a result of the exercise of such powers,  and neither it nor any of its
         officers,  directors,  employees or agents shall be  responsible to any
         Credit Party for any act or failure to act,  except for the Agent's own
         gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  as  determined  by a  final
         judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

         4.3.  COLLECTION OF PROCEEDS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

                  (a) On or before the Closing Date,  the Credit  Parties (other
         than the  Canadian  Borrowers)  shall (i) direct  all of their  account
         debtors and other obligors to make all payments on accounts  receivable
         of such Credit Parties  directly to post office boxes (each a "LOCKBOX"
         and  collectively  the  "LOCKBOXES")  under  the  control  of the  Cash
         Management  Bank and/or such other  financial  institutions as shall be
         acceptable to the Agent,  (ii)  establish  accounts (each a "CONTROLLED
         ACCOUNT" and  collectively  the  "CONTROLLED  ACCOUNTS") in the Agent's
         name for the  benefit of the  Borrower  with the Cash  Management  Bank
         and/or such other financial  institutions as shall be acceptable to the
         Agent,  into which all  payments  received  in the  Lockboxes  shall be
         deposited,  and into which such Credit Parties will immediately deposit
         all payments  made for  inventory or services  sold or rendered by such
         Credit  Parties and  received by such Credit  Parties in the  identical
         form in which such payments were made,  whether by cash or check, (iii)
         (A) to cause each financial  institution other than the Cash Management
         Bank  with  which  a  Lockbox  and/or   Controlled   Account  has  been
         established  to,  enter  into  a  Lockbox   Agreement   and/or  Control
         Agreement,  as  applicable,  confirming  that the amounts on deposit in
         such Lockbox and/or Controlled Account, as applicable, are the property
         of and are under the  control  of the  Agent,  and that such  financial
         institution  has no right to setoff  against such Lockbox or Controlled
         Account or  against  any other  account  maintained  by such  financial
         institution  into which the  contents  of such  Controlled  Account are
         transferred,  and (B) to direct such financial institution to cause all
         funds held in such Lockbox and/or  Controlled  Account to be wired,  or


                                       87

<PAGE>

         otherwise  transferred  in  immediately  available  funds  in a  manner
         satisfactory  to the Agent,  no less  frequently than once each day to,
         and only to, a Controlled  Account with the Cash  Management  Bank, and
         (iv) to cause each of their  Subsidiaries and Affiliate,  and any other
         Person acting for or in concert with such Credit  Parties that receives
         any monies,  checks,  notes, drafts or other payments relating to or as
         proceeds of accounts receivable or any Collateral,  to receive and hold
         such items in trust for, and as the sole and exclusive property of, the
         Agent and,  immediately upon receipt  thereof,  shall remit the same or
         cause  the  same to be  remitted  in hand to the  Controlled  Accounts;
         PROVIDED that, for purposes of  administrative  convenience,  the Agent
         may in its reasonable discretion,  permit such Credit Parties from time
         to time to maintain  one or more  accounts  with one or more  financial
         institutions  other than the Cash Management Bank and with such maximum
         cash balances as the Agent deems appropriate, and for which such Credit
         Parties  may, at the  discretion  of the Agent,  be  permitted  to have
         direct access.  All funds received in the Controlled Account maintained
         at the Cash  Management Bank as contemplated by this Section 4.3(a) and
         for  which  the  Borrower  has  received  credit  shall be  applied  in
         accordance with such subsection 2.7(c).

                  (b) On or before the  Closing  Date,  each  Canadian  Borrower
         shall (i) direct all of their  account  debtors  and other  obligors to
         make all  payments on accounts  receivable  of such  Canadian  Borrower
         directly to the operating account (the "NS ACCOUNT")  maintained by the
         Canadian  Lender and/or such other  financial  institutions as shall be
         acceptable  to the  Agent;  (ii)  cause  each of its  Subsidiaries  and
         Affiliates,  and any other  Person  acting for or in concert  with such
         Canadian Borrower that receives any monies,  checks,  notes,  drafts or
         other  payments  relating to or as proceeds of accounts  receivable  of
         such  Canadian  Borrower,  to receive and hold such items in trust for,
         and as the sole and exclusive  property of, the Agent and,  immediately
         upon  receipt  thereof,  to  remit  the  same or  cause  the same to be
         remitted in hand to the NS Account. The Credit Parties acknowledge that
         upon  receipt by the Canadian  Lender of written  notice from the Agent
         that an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing,  the Canadian
         Lender  shall  have  the  right  and  obligation  to  comply  with  any
         instructions  originated by the Agent directing disposition of funds in
         such  accounts  without  further  consent  of any  Credit  Party.  Each
         Canadian Borrower agrees to enter into a Lockbox  Agreement,  a Control
         Agreement or a blocked  account  agreement with the Canadian Lender and
         the Agent, as the Agent may reasonably  request.  All funds received in
         the NS Account for which the  Borrower  has  received  credit  shall be
         applied in the manner specified in subsection 2.8(c).

                  (c) Each Credit Party  acknowledges  that the Cash  Management
         Bank is an affiliate of the Agent and that the Cash Management Bank and
         the Agent are parties to cash  management  agreements that confirm that
         the Agent has  dominion  and  control  over all  accounts of the Credit
         Parties or the Agent  maintained by the Cash  Management  Bank, and all
         funds from time to time held in such accounts.  The Borrower, the Agent
         and the Cash Management Bank hereby agree that the Cash Management Bank
         shall comply with any  instructions  originated by the Agent  directing


                                       88

<PAGE>

         disposition of funds in such accounts  without  further  consent of the
         Borrower.   Each  Credit  Party  agrees  to  enter  into  such  Lockbox
         Agreements and Control Agreements with the Cash Management Bank and the
         Agent as the Agent may reasonably request.

                  (d) The Credit Parties agree to pay all reasonable fees, costs
         and expenses which the Credit Parties incur in connection  with opening
         and  maintaining a Lockbox and  Controlled  Account.  All of such fees,
         costs and  expenses  which  remain  unpaid  pursuant  to any Lockbox or
         Control  Agreement  with the Credit  Parties,  to the extent same shall
         have  been  paid  by  the  Agent  hereunder,   shall  constitute  Loans
         hereunder,  shall be payable to the Agent by the  Credit  Parties  upon
         demand,  and, until paid,  shall bear interest at the highest rate then
         applicable to Loans  hereunder.  All checks,  drafts,  instruments  and
         other  items of payment or  proceeds  of  Collateral  delivered  to the
         Canadian Lender, the Agent or the Cash Management Bank in kind shall be
         endorsed by the Credit Parties,  to the Agent, and, if that endorsement
         of any such item shall not be made for any reason, the Canadian Lender,
         the  Agent and the Cash  Management  Bank are each  hereby  irrevocably
         authorized to endorse the same on behalf of the Credit Parties. For the
         purpose of this subsection 4.3(d), each Credit Party irrevocably hereby
         makes,  constitutes and appoints the Agent (and all Persons  designated
         by the Agent for that purpose, including,  without limitation, the Cash
         Management  Bank and the Canadian  Lender) as such Credit  Party's true
         and lawful attorney and  agent-in-fact  (i) to endorse the name of such
         Credit Party upon said items of payment  and/or  proceeds of Collateral
         of the Credit Parties and upon any chattel paper, document, instrument,
         invoice  or similar  document  or  agreement  relating  to any  account
         receivable of the Credit Parties or goods pertaining  thereto;  (ii) to
         take control in any manner of any item of payment or proceeds  thereof;
         (iii) to have  access to any  lockbox or postal box into which any mail
         of the Credit Parties is deposited;  and (iv) open and process all mail
         addressed to the Credit Parties and deposited therein.

                  (e) The Agent  (and all  Persons  designated  by the Agent for
         such purpose, including,  without limitation, the Cash Management Bank)
         may, at any time and from time to time after the  occurrence and during
         the  continuance  of an  Event  of  Default,  whether  before  or after
         notification  to any  account  debtor and  whether  before or after the
         maturity  of any of the  Obligations,  (i)  enforce  collection  of any
         accounts receivable or contract rights of the Credit Parties by suit or
         otherwise;  (ii)  exercise all of the rights and remedies of the Credit
         Parties  with  respect to  proceedings  brought to collect any accounts
         receivable; (iii) surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any
         accounts  receivable of the Credit Parties,  or compromise or extend or
         renew for any period  (whether or not longer than the original  period)
         any indebtedness thereunder; (iv) sell or assign any account receivable
         of the Credit Parties upon such terms, for such amount and at such time
         or times as the Agent deems advisable;  (v) prepare,  file and sign the
         names of the  Credit  Parties  on any proof of claim in  bankruptcy  or
         other  similar  document  against  any  account  debtor  indebted on an


                                       89

<PAGE>

         account  receivable of the Credit  Parties;  and (vi) do all other acts
         and things  which are  necessary,  in the Agent's sole  discretion,  to
         fulfill the  Obligations of the Credit Parties under this Agreement and
         to allow the Agent to collect the accounts  receivable.  In addition to
         any other provision  hereof or in any of the other Loan Documents,  the
         Agent  may at any  time on or  after  the  occurrence  of an  Event  of
         Default, at the sole expense of the Credit Parties,  notify any parties
         obligated on any of the accounts  receivable  of the Credit  Parties to
         make payment  directly to the Agent of any amounts due or to become due
         thereunder.

         4.4.  FIXTURES,  ETC. It is the  intention  of the parties  hereto that
(except for Collateral located on any Mortgaged Property) none of the Collateral
shall become fixtures and each Credit Party will take all such reasonable action
or actions as may be necessary to prevent any of the  Collateral  from  becoming
fixtures.  Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  each Credit Party
will, if requested by the Agent, use commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain
waivers of Liens, in form  satisfactory  to the Agent,  from each lessor of real
property  on which any of the  Collateral  is or is to be  located to the extent
requested by the Agent.

         4.5. RIGHT OF AGENT TO DISPOSE OF COLLATERAL,  ETC. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of any Event of Default, subject to the provisions of
the MA UCC or other  applicable  law,  the  Agent  shall  have the right to take
possession of the Collateral and, in addition  thereto,  the right to enter upon
any  premises on which the  Collateral  or any part  thereof may be situated and
remove the same therefrom.  The Agent may require the Credit Parties to make the
Collateral  (to the extent  the same is  moveable)  available  to the Agent at a
place to be designated by the Agent or transfer any  information  related to the
Collateral to the Agent by electronic  medium.  The Agent may in its  discretion
require any Credit Party to assemble all or any part of the  Collateral  at such
location  or  locations  within  the  jurisdiction(s)  of  such  Credit  Party's
principal  office(s)  or at such  other  locations  as the Agent may  reasonably
designate.  Unless the Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily
in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Agent will
give the Credit  Parties at least  seven (7) days' prior  written  notice of the
time and place of any public sale thereof or of the time after which any private
sale or any other  intended  disposition  thereof is to be made. Any such notice
shall be deemed to meet any  requirement  hereunder or under any  applicable law
(including  the MA UCC) that  reasonable  notification  be given of the time and
place of such sale or other disposition.  In addition,  each Credit Party waives
any and all  rights  that it may have to a  judicial  hearing  in advance of the
enforcement of any of the Agent's rights and remedies hereunder.

         4.6.  RIGHT OF  AGENT  TO USE AND  OPERATE  COLLATERAL,  ETC.  Upon the
occurrence and during the  continuance  of any Event of Default,  subject to the
provisions of the MA UCC or other applicable law, the Agent shall have the right
and power (a) to take  possession of all or any part of the  Collateral,  and to
exclude the Credit  Parties and all Persons  claiming  under the Credit  Parties
wholly or partly therefrom,  and thereafter to hold, store, and/or use, operate,
manage and control  the same,  and (b) to grant a license to use, or cause to be
granted a license to use, any or all of the Patents,  Trademarks  and Copyrights
(in the case of Trademarks,  along with the goodwill associated therewith),  but


                                       90

<PAGE>

subject to the terms of any licenses.  Upon any such taking of  possession,  the
Agent may,  from time to time,  at the expense of the Credit  Parties,  make all
such repairs,  replacements,  alterations,  additions and improvements to and of
the  Collateral  as the Agent may deem proper.  In any such case the Agent shall
have the right to manage and control the Collateral and to carry on the business
and to exercise all rights and powers of the Credit  Parties in respect  thereto
as the Agent shall deem  proper,  including  the right to enter into any and all
such  agreements  with respect to the  operation of the  Collateral  or any part
thereof as the Agent may see fit; and the Agent shall be entitled to collect and
receive all rents, issues,  profits, fees, revenues and other income of the same
and every part thereof.  Such rents, issues,  profits,  fees, revenues and other
income  shall be  applied  to pay the  expenses  of holding  and  operating  the
Collateral  and of  conducting  the business  thereof,  and of all  maintenance,
repairs, replacements,  alterations, additions and improvements, and to make all
payments  which the  Agent may be  required  or may elect to make,  if any,  for
taxes, assessments,  insurance and other charges upon the Collateral or any part
thereof, and all other payments which the Agent may be required or authorized to
make under any provision of this Agreement (including legal costs and reasonable
attorneys'  fees).  The Agent shall apply the  remainder of such rents,  issues,
profits, fees, revenues and other income as provided in Section 4.7.

         4.7.  PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL.  After deducting all reasonable costs and
expenses of collection, storage, custody, sale or other disposition and delivery
(including  reasonable  legal costs and  attorneys'  fees) and all other charges
against the Collateral, the Agent shall apply the residue of the proceeds of any
such sale or disposition to the  Obligations in accordance with the terms hereof
and any  surplus  shall be  returned  to the Credit  Parties or to any Person or
party lawfully entitled thereto. In the event the proceeds of any sale, lease or
other  disposition  of  the  Collateral  are  insufficient  to  pay  all  of the
Obligations  in full,  the Credit  Parties  will be liable  for the  deficiency,
together  with  interest  thereon  at the  Post-Default  Rate,  and the cost and
expenses of collection of such deficiency, including (to the extent permitted by
law),   without   limitation,   reasonable   attorneys'   fees,   expenses   and
disbursements.

         4.8. RELATION TO COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS. The provisions of this Agreement
supplement the  provisions of any real estate  mortgage or deed of trust granted
by any Credit Party to the Agent,  for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent,
and which secures the payment or performance of any of the Obligations.  Nothing
contained in any such real estate  mortgage or deed of trust shall derogate from
any of the rights or remedies of the Agent or any of the Lenders  hereunder.  In
addition,  to the provisions of this Agreement  being so read and construed with
any such mortgage or deed of trust,  the provisions of this  Agreement  shall be
read and construed with the Collateral Documents referred to below in the manner
so indicated.

                  (a) PLEDGE AGREEMENTS. Concurrently herewith each Credit Party
         is  executing  and  delivering  to the  Agent,  for the  benefit of the
         Lenders and the Agent, a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which such Credit
         Party is  pledging  to the Agent (a) 100% of the shares of the  Capital
         Stock  of its  Domestic  Subsidiary  or  Subsidiaries,  and/or  Audubon

         Europe,  as the case may be, (b) 65% of the shares of the Capital Stock
         of its Foreign  Subsidiary or Subsidiaries  (other than Audubon Europe)
         and (c) all  promissory  notes held by or payable to such Credit Party.
         Such pledge shall be governed by the terms of such pledge agreement and
         not  by  the  terms  of  this  Agreement.

                  (b) TRADEMARK  AND PATENT  AGREEMENTS.  Concurrently  herewith
         each Credit Party is executing  and  delivering  to the Agent,  for the
         benefit of the  Lenders  and the Agent,  a  Trademark  Agreement  and a
         Patent  Agreement  pursuant to which such Credit  Party is assigning to
         the Agent,  for the  benefit  of the  Lenders  and the  Agent,  certain
         Collateral  consisting of  trademarks,  service marks and trademark and
         service  mark  rights,  patent and  patent  rights,  together  with the
         goodwill appurtenant thereto. The provisions of the Trademark Agreement
         and the Patent  Agreement are  supplemental  to the  provisions of this
         Agreement,  and nothing  contained  in the  Trademark  Agreement or the
         Patent  Agreement  shall derogate from any of the rights or remedies of
         the Agent or any of the Lenders hereunder. Neither the delivery of, nor
         anything contained in, the Trademark  Agreement or the Patent Agreement
         shall be  deemed to  prevent  or  postpone  the time of  attachment  or
         perfection of any security interest in such Collateral created hereby.

                  (c)  COPYRIGHT  MORTGAGES,  ETC.  Concurrently  herewith  each
         Credit Party is also  executing and  delivering  to the Agent,  for the
         benefit of the  Lenders  and the  Agent,  for  recording  in the United
         States Copyright Office (the "COPYRIGHT  OFFICE") a Memorandum of Grant
         of Security  Interest in Copyrights.  Such Credit Party  represents and
         warrants  to the  Lenders  and the Agent that such  Copyright  Mortgage
         identifies all now existing material copyrights and other rights in and
         to all material  copyrightable works of such Credit Party,  identified,
         where applicable, by title, author and/or Copyright Office registration
         number and date.  Each  Credit  Party  represents  and  warrants to the
         Lenders and the Agent that it has  registered  all material  copyrights
         with the Copyright  Office,  as identified in such Copyright  Mortgage.
         Each Credit Party  covenants,  promptly  following  such Credit Party's
         acquisition  thereof,  to provide to the Agent like  identifications of
         all  material  copyrights  and  other  rights  in and  to all  material
         copyrightable  works  hereafter  acquired  by  such  Credit  Party,  to
         register such copyrights  with the Copyright  Office and to execute and
         deliver to the Agent,  for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent,  a
         supplemental Memorandum of Grant of Security Interest in Copyrights, in
         form and substance  satisfactory  to the Agent,  for the benefit of the
         Lenders and the Agent, modified to reflect such subsequent acquisitions
         and registrations.

         4.9. MARSHALLING. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be required to
marshal any present or future collateral  security (including but not limited to
the Collateral)  for, or other  assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any
of them or to resort to such collateral  security or other assurances of payment
in any particular  order, and all of the rights and remedies of the Agent or any
Lender  hereunder  and of the Agent or any Lender in respect of such  collateral
security and other  assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to


                                       92

<PAGE>

all other rights and remedies,  however existing or arising.  To the extent that
it lawfully may, each Credit Party hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law
relating to the  marshalling of collateral  which might cause delay in or impede
the enforcement of the Agent's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under
any other  instrument  creating or evidencing  any of the  Obligations  or under
which any of the  Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the  Obligations
is secured or payment thereof is otherwise  assured,  and, to the extent that it
lawfully  may, such Credit Party hereby  irrevocably  waives the benefits of all
such laws.

                                   ARTICLE 5.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Credit Party  represents and warrants to the Lenders,  the Issuing
Lender and the Agent, as to itself and each other Credit Party, that:

         5.1.  ORGANIZATION;  POWERS.  Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has been duly formed or organized  and is validly  existing and in good standing
under the laws of its  jurisdiction of  organization  or formation.  Each of the
Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  has all requisite  power to own its property and
authority  to  carry  on  its  business  as  now   conducted  and  as  presently
contemplated,  and is qualified  to do business in, and is in good  standing and
duly authorized to do business in, every  jurisdiction  where such qualification
is  required,  except where the failure to have such power or authority or to be

         5.2. AUTHORIZATION;  ENFORCEABILITY. The borrowing of the Loans and the
grant of security  interests pursuant to the Loan Documents are within the power
and authority of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries,  as applicable,  and

and each of its Subsidiaries,  as applicable.  This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents have been duly authorized,  executed and delivered by the Borrower and
each of its Subsidiaries,  as applicable and constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations  of the  Borrower  and  each  of its  Subsidiaries,  as  applicable,
enforceable in accordance  with their  respective  terms,  subject to applicable
bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  or other  laws  affecting
creditors'  rights  generally  and  subject  to  general  principles  of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

         5.3. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS;  NO CONFLICTS.  The borrowing of the Loans
and the grant of the security  interests  pursuant to the Loan  Documents (a) do
not require any consent or approval  of,  registration  or filing  with,  or any
other action by, any Governmental Authority which has not been obtained,  except
as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.3, (b) will not violate any applicable law, policy or
regulation  or  the  organizational  documents  of  the  Borrower  or any of its
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or
result in a default under any material term of any indenture, agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
assets,  or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by


                                       93

<PAGE>

the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) except for the Liens created by
the Loan Documents, will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

         5.4.  FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.

                  (a) The Credit Parties have heretofore  delivered to the Agent
         and the Lenders the following financial statements:

                           (i) the consolidated balance sheets and statements of
                  operations   and   cash   flows  of  the   Borrower   and  its
                  Subsidiaries,  as of and for the fiscal  years ended March 31,
                  2000,  March  31,  2001,  and  March  31,  2002,  audited  and
                  accompanied by an opinion of the Borrower's independent public
                  accountants;

                           (ii) the  unaudited  consolidated  balance  sheet and
                  statements  of  operations  and cash flows of the Borrower and
                  its Subsidiaries, as of and for the fiscal year-to-date period
                  ended September 30, 2002,  certified by a Designated Financial
                  Officer  that such  financial  statements  fairly  present the
                  financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at
                  such date and the results of the  operations  of the  Borrower
                  and its  Subsidiaries  for the  period  ended on such date and
                  that all such  financial  statements,  including  the  related
                  schedules and notes thereto have been prepared in all material
                  respects  in   accordance   with  GAAP  applied   consistently
                  throughout  the  periods  involved,  except  as  disclosed  on
                  SCHEDULE 5.4; and

                           (iii)  the  projected  consolidated  balance  sheets,
                  statements of operations and cash flows,  for the Borrower and
                  its  Subsidiaries  for the fiscal  years  ended March 31, 2003
                  through March 31, 2007.

                  Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.4, such financial statements
         (except for the projections)  present fairly, in all material respects,
         the  respective   consolidated   financial   position  and  results  of
         operations  and  cash  flows  of the  respective  entities  as of  such
         respective dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP,  subject
         to year-end audit  adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case
         of  such  unaudited  or pro  forma  statements.  The  projections  were
         prepared by the  Borrower  in good faith and were based on  assumptions
         that were reasonable when made.

                  (b) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.4,  since  September 30,
         2002,  there  has been no  material  adverse  change  in the  business,
         assets,  operations  or  condition,  financial  or  otherwise,  of  the
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries  from that set forth in the September 30,
         2002 financial  statements  referred to in clause (ii) of paragraph (a)
         above.

                  (c) Neither the  Borrower nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has on
         the Closing Date any  contingent  liabilities,  liabilities  for taxes,
         unusual  forward or long-term  commitments or unrealized or anticipated


                                       94

<PAGE>

         losses from any unfavorable commitments in each case that are material,
         except as referred to or  reflected  or provided  for in the  financial
         statements  described  in this  Section 5.4 or in SCHEDULE  5.4 annexed
         hereto, or as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (d) SCHEDULE  5.4(D) hereto contains the calculation of EBITDA
         and other financial  information,  including  restructuring charges for
         the fiscal  quarters ending March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September
         30, 2002.

         5.5.  PROPERTIES.

                  (a) Each of the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  has good and
         marketable  title to, or valid,  subsisting and  enforceable  leasehold
         interests  in, all of its  Properties  material  to its  business.  All
         machinery and equipment of each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is
         in good operating condition and repair, and all necessary  replacements
         of and repairs  thereto have be made so as to preserve and maintain the
         value and operating efficiency of such machinery and equipment.

                  (b) Set forth on SCHEDULE 5.5 hereto is a complete list of all
         Patents,  Trademarks and Copyrights.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries
         own, or are licensed to use, all Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights and
         other intellectual  property material to their business  (collectively,
         the "PROPRIETARY RIGHTS"), and to the knowledge of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries,   the  use  thereof  by  the   Borrower  or  any  of  its
         Subsidiaries  does not  infringe  upon the rights of any other  Person,
         except  for  any  such  infringements  that,  individually  or  in  the
         aggregate,  could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect.

                  (c) SCHEDULE 5.5 clearly  identifies  all Patents,  Trademarks
         and Copyrights that have been duly registered in, filed in or issued by
         the PTO or the United States Register of Copyrights (collectively,  the
         "REGISTERED  PROPRIETARY  Rights").  The Registered  Proprietary Rights
         have been  properly  maintained  and  renewed  in  accordance  with all
         applicable  provisions  of law and  administrative  regulations  in the
         United States,  as applicable.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries  have
         taken  commercially   reasonable  steps  to  protect  their  Registered
         Proprietary   Rights  and  to  maintain  the   confidentiality  of  all
         Proprietary Rights that are not generally in the public domain.

                  (d)  As of the  Closing  Date,  SCHEDULE  5.5  annexed  hereto
         contains a true,  accurate and complete  list of (i) all Real  Property
         Assets,  whether  owned or leased,  and (ii) all leases,  subleases  or
         assignments  of leases  (together with all  amendments,  modifications,
         supplements,  renewals or  extensions  of any thereof)  affecting  each
         Leasehold  Property,  regardless  of whether the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries  is the  landlord  or tenant  (whether  directly  or as an
         assignee  or  successor  in  interest)  under such  lease,  sublease or
         assignment.  Except as specified in SCHEDULE 5.5, each agreement listed
         in clause (ii) of the immediately  preceding  sentence is in full force


                                       95

<PAGE>

         and effect and neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
         knowledge  of  any  default   that  has  occurred  and  is   continuing
         thereunder,  and each such agreement  constitutes the legal,  valid and
         binding  obligation  of the Borrower and each of its  Subsidiaries,  as
         applicable,   enforceable   against  the   Borrower  and  each  of  its
         Subsidiaries,  as applicable,  in accordance with its terms,  except as
         enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,
         moratorium  or similar laws relating to or limiting  creditors'  rights
         generally or by equitable principles.

         5.6.  LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (a)  Except  as  set  forth  on  SCHEDULE  5.6,  there  are no
         Environmental  Actions  of any  kind by or  before  any  arbitrator  or
         Governmental  Authority  pending  against or, to the  knowledge  of the
         Borrower and its  Subsidiaries,  threatened  against or  affecting  the
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries  that (i) if adversely  determined,
         could have a Material  Adverse Effect or (ii) relates to this Agreement
         or any other Loan Document or any  transaction  contemplated  hereby or
         thereby.

                  (b) The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have taken all necessary
         steps to  investigate  the past and present  condition and usage of the
         Real Property  Assets and the operations  conducted  thereon and, based
         upon such diligent investigation,  have determined, except as set forth
         on SCHEDULE 5.6, that:

                           (i) none of the  Borrower,  its  Subsidiaries  or any
                  operator of the Real  Property  Assets  currently  or formerly
                  owned,  leased  or  operated  by  the  Borrower,  any  of  its
                  Subsidiaries or any  predecessor-in-interest or any operations
                  thereon are in violation or alleged violation, in any material
                  respect, of any Environmental Laws;

                           (ii) neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has become subject to any Environmental Liabilities and do not
                  know of any basis for any Environmental  Liabilities,  in each
                  case, which would have a Material Adverse Effect;

                           (iii)   neither   the   Borrower   nor   any  of  its
                  Subsidiaries   has  received   notice  from  any  third  party
                  including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority, (A)
                  that  any one of them has been  identified  by a  Governmental
                  Authority   as   a   potentially   responsible   party   under
                  Environmental Law; (B) that the Borrower,  its Subsidiaries or
                  any  predecessor-in-interest  has  generated,  transported  or
                  disposed  of any  Hazardous  Materials  at any site at which a
                  Governmental Authority has conducted or has ordered a party to
                  conduct a Remedial  Action,  removal or other response  action
                  pursuant to any Environmental Law; or (C) that the Borrower or
                  any of its  Subsidiaries  is or shall be a named  party to any
                  Environmental   Action   arising  out  of  any  third  party's
                  incurrence of costs,  expenses,  losses or damages of any kind
                  whatsoever  in  connection   with  the  Release  of  Hazardous
                  Materials;

enforcement  of  compliance   therewith,   the  collection  thereof  and/or  the
imposition of any penalty,  fine or Lien with respect thereto, and for which the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has set aside on its books adequate reserves

                  (c) SCHEDULE 5.14 hereto contains a complete and correct list,

         waivers and other modifications thereto. All such agreements are valid,
         subsisting,  in full force and effect,  are currently  binding and will
         continue to be binding upon the  Borrower and each of its  Subsidiaries
         that is a party thereto and, to the best  knowledge of the Borrower and


                                      100
<PAGE>

         its Subsidiaries,  binding upon the other parties thereto in accordance
         with their terms.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not in default

security arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents, will not violate or be
inconsistent with any of the provisions of Regulations T, U, or X of the Board.

initial Loans hereunder and the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated

         its  Subsidiaries  at  their  present  fair  saleable  value on a going
         concern  basis  (i.e.,  the  amount  that  may  be  realized  within  a
         reasonable  time,  considered  to be six  months  to one  year,  either
         through collection or sale at the regular market value,  conceiving the
         latter as the amount that could be obtained for such properties  within
         such period by a capable and diligent  businessman  from an  interested
         buyer who is willing to purchase  under ordinary  selling  conditions),
         exceed  the  amount  of  all  the  debts  and  liabilities   (including
         contingent,  subordinated,  unmatured and unliquidated  liabilities) of
         the Borrower and its Subsidiaries;

                  (b)  the  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries   will  not,  on  a
         consolidated  basis,  have an unreasonably  small capital with which to
         conduct their business operations as heretofore conducted; and

                  (c)  the  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  will  have,  on  a
         consolidated  basis,  sufficient  cash flow to enable them to pay their
         debts as they mature.

         5.17.  FORCE MAJEURE.  Since  September 30, 2002, none of the business,

armed  forces or act of God that has or could  reasonably  be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.18.  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  The Agent may rely, in determining  which
accounts receivable are Eligible Accounts, on all statements and representations
made by the Credit  Parties with  respect to such  accounts  receivable.  Unless
otherwise indicated to the Agent in writing:

                  (a) Each  account  receivable  is genuine and in all  respects
         what it purports to be, and it is not evidenced by a judgment;


                                      101
<PAGE>

                  (b) Each account  receivable  arises out of a completed,  bona
         fide sale and  delivery of goods or  rendition  of services by a Credit
         Party in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with the
         terms  and  conditions  of all  purchase  orders,  contracts  or  other
         documents  relating  thereto and forming a part of the contract between
         such Credit  Party and the account  debtor,  and, in the case of goods,
         title to the goods has  passed  from the  Credit  Party to the  account
         debtor;

                  (c)  Each  account  receivable  is  for  a  liquidated  amount
         maturing  as  stated in the  duplicate  invoice  covering  such sale or
         rendition  of  services,  a copy of  which  has  been  furnished  or is
         available to the Agent;

                  (d) Each account receivable, and the Agent's security interest
         therein,  is not,  and will not (by  voluntary  act or  omission of the
         Credit  Parties)  be in  the  future,  subject  to  any  offset,  Lien,
         deduction,   defense,  dispute,   counterclaim  or  any  other  adverse
         condition  except for disputes  resulting  in returned  goods where the
         amount in controversy is deemed by the Agent to be immaterial, and each
         such  account  receivable  is  absolutely  owing  to one of the  Credit
         Parties and is not contingent in any respect or for any reason;

                  (e) No Credit  Party has made any  agreement  with any account
         debtor for any extension, compromise, settlement or modification of any
         account  receivable or any  deduction  therefrom,  except  discounts or
         allowances  which are  granted  by the Credit  Parties in the  ordinary
         course of their  businesses  for prompt payment and which are reflected
         in the calculation of the net amount of each respective invoice related
         thereto  and are  reflected  in the  Borrowing  Base  Certificates  and
         Collateral Update Certificates furnished to the Agent hereunder;

                  (f) To the best knowledge of the Credit  Parties,  the account
         debtor  under each account  receivable  had the capacity to contract at
         the time any  contract  or other  document  giving  rise to an  account
         receivable was executed and such account debtor is not insolvent; and

                  (g) To the best knowledge of the Credit Parties,  there are no
         proceedings  or actions  which are  threatened  or pending  against any
         account  debtor which might result in any  material  adverse  change in
         such account debtor's financial  condition or the collectability of any
         account receivable.

         5.19.  LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

                  (a) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.19, (A) to the knowledge
         of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, no employee of the Borrower

         labor  union,  and  there  are no such  contracts  or other  agreements


                                      102
<PAGE>

         of any employee of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;  (B) to the
         knowledge  of the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  there are no

         Subsidiaries have at all times complied in all material  respects,  and

         employment.

<PAGE>

         with any other ERISA Events that have  occurred,  could  reasonably  be

penalty,  fine or Lien with respect thereto and (b) such Person has set aside on
its books adequate  reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, which

engaged  in the same or  similar  businesses  operating  in the same or  similar
locations,  including,  without  limitation,  business  interruption and product

Person  will  not be  deemed  a  co-insurer  under  applicable  insurance  laws,
regulations  and policies and otherwise  shall be in such amounts,  contain such
terms,  be in  such  forms  and  be  for  such  periods  as  may  be  reasonably

insurance,  in each case with such insurance  companies,  in such amounts,  with

satisfactory  in form and  substance to the Agent,  that names the Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders as the loss payee  thereunder.  All policies of insurance
shall  provide  for at least 30 days  prior  written  notice to the Agent of any
modifications or cancellation of such policy.

which fairly record such  transactions and activities.  The Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries shall permit any representatives designated by the Agent or any
Lender to visit and inspect its  properties,  to examine and make  extracts from
its  books  and  records,  to  conduct  audits,  physical  counts,   valuations,
appraisals or examinations  and  verifications  (whether by internal  commercial
finance  examiners or  independent  auditors) of all Collateral and the Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition
with its officers and  independent  accountants at any  reasonable  times and as
frequently as the Agent deems appropriate;  PROVIDED that, so long as no Default
has occurred and is continuing, (x) all such visits shall be on reasonable prior
notice,  at reasonable  times during  regular  business  hours and (y) the Agent
shall not conduct commercial finance  examinations more than once in any 180 day
period;   and  PROVIDED  further  that  after  the  occurrence  and  during  the
continuance  of any  Default,  the  Agent  and  the  Lenders  may  visit  at any
reasonable times. The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for all
examination and inspections costs, internal costs at the Agent's customary rates
in  effect  from  time to time,  plus all  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  in
connection  with  such  audits,  physical  counts,  valuations,   appraisals  or
examinations.   Each  of  the  Credit  Parties  authorizes  the  Agent  and,  if
accompanied by the Agent,  the Lenders to communicate  directly with such Credit
Party's independent certified public accountants and authorizes such accountants
to disclose to the Agent and the Lenders any and all  financial  statements  and
other  supporting  financial  documents  and schedules  including  copies of any
management letters with respect to the business,  financial  condition and other
affairs of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. At the request of the Agent,
each  Credit  Party  shall  deliver  a  letter  addressed  to  such  accountants
instructing  them to comply with the  provisions of this Section 7.6. The Credit
Parties,  in consultation  with the Agent, will arrange for a meeting to be held
at least once every year (and after the occurrence and during the continuance of
a Default,  more frequently,  if requested by the Agent or the Required Lenders)
with the Lenders and the Agent hereunder at which the business and operations of
the Credit  Parties are discussed.  The Credit  Parties will permit  independent
appraisers  and  environmental  consultants  selected  by the Agent to visit the
properties of the Credit Parties and perform  appraisals and examinations of the
machinery,  equipment  and Real  Property  Assets of the Credit  Parties at such
times and with such frequencies as the Agent shall reasonably request,  PROVIDED
that, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing,  the Agent shall not
request that the  equipment  or Real  Property  Assets of the Credit  Parties be
appraised or examined by  independent  appraisers or  environmental  consultants
more frequently than once every year, commencing on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date and  PROVIDED  further  that,  such  appraisals  shall only include
inventory if the  inclusion of the inventory of any Credit Party in the Domestic
Borrowing  Base or in the Canadian  Borrowing  Base, at any time in the one year


                                      115

period prior to such  appraisal,  was necessary in order than the Borrower would
be in compliance  with the borrowing  limitations  contained in Section 2.1. The
Borrower  shall  reimburse  the Agent and the  Lenders  for all fees,  costs and
expenses charged by such independent  appraisers and  environmental  consultants
for each such appraisal and examination.

         7.7. FISCAL YEAR. To enable the ready and consistent  determination  of
compliance with the covenants set forth in Section 8.10 hereof, the Borrower and
each of its  Subsidiaries  shall  maintain their current fiscal year and current
method of  determining  the last day of the first three fiscal  quarters in each
fiscal year.

         7.8.  COMPLIANCE  WITH LAWS. The Borrower and each of its  Subsidiaries
shall  comply  in all  material  respects  with (i) all  permits,  licenses  and
authorizations,  including, without limitation,  environmental permits, licenses
and authorizations,  issued by a Governmental  Authority,  (ii) all laws, rules,
regulations and orders including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, of any
Governmental  Authority  and (iii)  all  contractual  obligations,  in each case
applicable to it or its property.

         7.9. USE OF  PROCEEDS.  The proceeds of the Loans will be used only for
(i) the refinancing and repayment of Existing  Indebtedness  and of Indebtedness
in respect of the Senior  Note  Documents,  (ii) fees and  expenses  incurred in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) for
general corporate and working capital purposes of the Credit Parties. No part of
the proceeds of any Loan will be used,  whether directly or indirectly,  for any
purpose  that  entails  a  violation  of any of the  Regulations  of the  Board,
including Regulations T, U and X.

         7.10. CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS  RESPECTING  SUBSIDIARIES.  Each Credit Party
will, and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, take such action from time to
time as shall be  necessary  to ensure  that the  percentage  of the  issued and
outstanding shares of Capital Stock of any class or character owned by it in any
of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date is not at any time decreased, other than
by reason of transfers to another Credit Party.

         7.11. ERISA. The Credit Parties (a) will maintain, and cause each ERISA
Affiliate to maintain,  each Plan in material  compliance with the provisions of
such Plan and all applicable  requirements of ERISA and of the Code and with all
applicable  rulings and regulations  issued under the provisions of ERISA and of
the Code and (b) will not and, to the extent authorized,  will not permit any of
the ERISA  Affiliates to (i) engage in any transaction  with respect to any Plan
which would subject any Credit Party to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant
to Section  502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section  4975 of the Code,  (ii)
fail to make full payment when due of all amounts which, under the provisions of
any  Plan,  any  Credit  Party or any  ERISA  Affiliate  is  required  to pay as
contributions thereto, or permit to exist any accumulated funding deficiency (as
such term is  defined  in  Section  302 of ERISA and  Section  412 of the Code),
whether or not waived,  with  respect to any Pension  Plan or (iii) fail to make
any payments to any Multiemployer Plan that any Credit Party or any of the ERISA
Affiliates  may be  required  to  make  under  any  agreement  relating  to such
Multiemployer Plan or any law pertaining thereto.

         any Real Property  Asset prepared by a  hydrogeologist,  an independent
         engineer or other qualified  consultant or expert approved by the Agent
         to evaluate or confirm (a) whether any Hazardous  Materials are present
         in the soil, sediment, air or water at such Real Property Asset and (b)

         and  regulations  (in each case to the extent  required under such laws
         and regulations as determined by the Agent in its sole discretion).

         renew,  any  license or permit now held or  hereafter  acquired  by any

         any material portion of the property of such Person; or

                  (x) a "Default" or an "Event of Default"  shall have  occurred
         under the Senior Note Indenture;

then,  and in every such event  (other than an event  described in clause (g) or
(h) of this Section 9.1), and at any time  thereafter  during the continuance of
such event,  the Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by
notice to the Borrower, take any or all of the following actions, at the same or
different times:  (i) terminate the  Commitments,  and thereupon the Commitments
shall  terminate  immediately,  (ii) notify the  Borrower  that the  outstanding
principal  of the Loans  shall  bear  interest  at the  Post-Default  Rate,  and
thereupon  the  outstanding  principal  of the Loans shall bear  interest at the
Post-Default  Rate,  (iii)  declare  the Loans  then  outstanding  to be due and
payable in whole (or in part,  in which case any principal not so declared to be
due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon
the  principal  of the Loans so declared to be due and  payable,  together  with
accrued  interest thereon and all fees and other  Obligations,  shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind,  all of which are hereby  waived by the Credit  Parties,  (iv) require
that the Borrower  deposit with the Agent cash  collateral  for all  outstanding
Letters of Credit,  and (v) the Agent,  the Issuing Lender,  the Cash Management
Bank and the  Lenders  may  exercise  all of the  rights  as  secured  party and

                                      133
<PAGE>

protest  or other  notice of any kind,  all of which  are  hereby  waived by the
Credit Parties,  and the Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Cash Management Bank and
the Lenders  shall be  permitted  to exercise  such rights as secured  party and
mortgagee hereunder or under the other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

         9.2.  DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that, following
the occurrence or during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the
Agent or any Lender,  as the case may be, receives any monies in connection with
the  enforcement  of  any  Loan  Document,  or  otherwise  with  respect  to the
realization  upon any of the  Collateral,  such monies shall be distributed  for
application as follows:

                  (a)  First,  to the  payment  of,  or (as the case may be) the
         reimbursement  of the Agent for or in respect of all reasonable  costs,
         expenses,  disbursements  and losses which shall have been  incurred or
         sustained by the Agent in connection with the collection of such monies
         by the Agent, for the exercise,  protection or enforcement by the Agent
         of all or any of the rights,  remedies,  powers and  privileges  of the
         Agent under this  Agreement  or any of the other Loan  Documents  or in
         respect of the  Collateral  or in support of any  provision of adequate
         indemnity  to the Agent  against  any Taxes or liens which by law shall
         have,  or may  have,  priority  over the  rights  of the  Agent to such
         monies;

                  (b)  Second,  to  all  other  Obligations  in  such  order  or
         preference as the Required  Lenders may determine;  PROVIDED,  however,
         that (i)  distributions  shall be made (A) PARI PASSU among Obligations
         with respect to fees payable to the Agent,  the Issuing  Lender and all
         other Obligations and (B) with respect to each type of Obligation owing
         to the Lenders, such as interest,  principal,  fees and expenses, among
         the Lenders  PRO RATA,  and (ii) the Agent may in its  discretion  make
         proper  allowance to take into account any Obligations not then due and
         payable;

                  (c) Third,  upon  payment  and  satisfaction  in full or other
         provisions  for  payment in full  satisfactory  to the  Lenders and the
         Agent of all of the  Obligations,  to the  payment  of any  obligations
         required to be paid pursuant to ss.9-608(a)(1)(C) or 9-615(a)(3) of the
         Uniform  Commercial  Code of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts;  and
         (d)Fourth,  the excess, if any, shall be returned to the Borrower or to
         such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

         9.3. RECEIVERSHIP.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or
limiting  in any way the rights of the Agent or the Lenders  hereunder  or under
the other Loan Documents or otherwise  under  applicable  law, at any time after


                                      134
<PAGE>

(i) the entire  principal  balance of any Loan shall have become due and payable
(whether at maturity,  by  acceleration  or otherwise)  and (ii) the Agent shall
have provided to the Borrower not less than ten (10) days' prior written  notice
of its  intention to apply for a receiver,  the Agent shall be entitled to apply
for and have a  receiver  appointed  under  state or  federal  law by a court of
competent  jurisdiction in any action taken by the Agent to enforce the Lenders'
and the Agent's rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
in order to manage, protect,  preserve, sell and otherwise dispose of all or any
portion of the  Collateral  and  continue  the  operation of the business of the
Credit  Parties,  and to collect all revenues and profits  thereof and apply the
same to the  payment of all  expenses  and other  charges of such  receivership,
including the compensation of the receiver,  and to the payment of the Loans and
other fees and expenses due hereunder and under the Loan  Documents as aforesaid
until a sale or other  disposition of such Collateral  shall be finally made and
consummated. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY  CONSENTS TO AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO OBJECT TO OR OTHERWISE  CONTEST
THE  APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER AS PROVIDED  ABOVE.  EACH CREDIT PARTY (I) GRANTS
SUCH  WAIVER AND CONSENT  KNOWINGLY  AFTER  HAVING  DISCUSSED  THE  IMPLICATIONS
THEREOF WITH COUNSEL, (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) THE UNCONTESTED RIGHT TO HAVE A
RECEIVER APPOINTED FOR THE FOREGOING  PURPOSES IS CONSIDERED  ESSENTIAL BY AGENT
IN CONNECTION  WITH THE  ENFORCEMENT  OF THE LENDERS' AND THE AGENT'S RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES HEREUNDER AND UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS,  AND (B) THE AVAILABILITY
OF SUCH APPOINTMENT AS A REMEDY UNDER THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES WAS A MATERIAL
FACTOR IN  INDUCING  THE  LENDERS TO MAKE THE LOANS TO THE  BORROWER;  AND (III)
AGREES  TO  ENTER  INTO  ANY AND  ALL  STIPULATIONS  IN ANY  LEGAL  ACTIONS,  OR
AGREEMENTS  OR  OTHER  INSTRUMENTS  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THE  FOREGOING  AND TO
COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSUMPTION
AND  EXERCISE  OF  CONTROL  BY THE  RECEIVER  OVER  ALL OR  ANY  PORTION  OF THE
COLLATERAL.  THE LENDERS AND AGENT  ACKNOWLEDGE  AND AGREE THAT  NOTHING IN THIS
SECTION  9.2  SHALL BE  DEEMED  TO  CONSTITUTE  A WAIVER  OF THE RIGHT OF CREDIT
PARTIES TO FILE FOR  PROTECTION  UNDER TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE AT ANY
TIME.

                                   ARTICLE 10.

                                    THE AGENT

         10.1.  APPOINTMENT  AND  AUTHORIZATION.  Each  of the  Lenders  and the
Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Agent as its agent and authorizes
the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise  such powers as are
delegated  to the  Agent  by the  terms of this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  together with such actions and powers as are  reasonably  incidental
thereto.Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  each of the Lenders
and the  Issuing  Lender  hereby  (a)  authorizes  the  Agent to enter  into the
Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf and consents and agrees to be bound by the


                                      135
<PAGE>

terms therein,  (b) authorizes the Agent to release,  from time to time, certain
of the  Collateral in connection  with any sale or other  disposition  of assets
permitted  hereunder,  and (c)  authorizes the Agent to take such actions at any
time to  enforce  such  Lender's  rights  hereunder  and under  the  other  Loan
Documents.  The Agent shall be the  "representative" of the Lenders for purposes
of its designation as a secured party on all security filings.

         10.2.   AGENT'S  RIGHTS  AS  LENDER.  The  Lender  or  other  financial
institution  serving as the Agent or the Issuing Lender hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender hereunder as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent or the Issuing Lender,
and such  institution and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
and generally engage in any kind of business with any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries  or other  Affiliate  thereof  as if it were  not the  Agent or the
Issuing Lender hereunder.

         10.3.  DUTIES AS  EXPRESSLY  STATED.  Neither the Agent nor the Issuing
Lender shall have any duties or obligations  except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing,  (a) neither the Agent nor the Issuing Lender shall be subject to
any  fiduciary  or other  implied  duties,  regardless  of whether a Default has
occurred and is  continuing,  (b) neither the Agent nor the Issuing Lender shall
have any duty to take any  discretionary  action or exercise  any  discretionary
powers,  except discretionary  rights and powers expressly  contemplated by this
Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents  that the Agent or  Issuing  Lender is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as is required hereunder with respect to such action),
and (c) except as expressly  set forth  herein and in the other Loan  Documents,
neither the Agent nor the Issuing  Lender  shall have any duty to  disclose,  or
shall be liable for the failure to  disclose,  any  information  relating to any
Credit Party or any of their respective  Subsidiaries that is communicated to or
obtained by the financial institution serving as the Agent or the Issuing Lender
or any of its  Affiliates or Approved  Funds in any capacity.  Neither the Agent
nor the Issuing  Lender  shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or  percentage  of the Lenders as is  required  hereunder  with  respect to such
action) or all of the Lenders if  expressly  required,  or in the absence of its
own gross  negligence or willful  misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor the Issuing
Lender shall be deemed to have  knowledge of any Default other than a Default of
the types specified in Section 9.1(a) unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Agent or the Issuing  Lender by the  Borrower or a Lender,  and the
Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into
(i) any statement,  warranty or  representation  made in, or in connection with,
this  Agreement  or  the  other  Loan  Documents,   (ii)  the  contents  of  any
certificate,  report or other document  delivered  hereunder or under any of the
other  Loan  Documents  or  in  connection  herewith  of  therewith,  (iii)  the
performance or observance of any of the covenants,  agreements or other terms or
conditions  set forth herein or in any other Loan  Document,  (iv) the validity,
enforceability,  effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement,  the other Loan
Documents  or  any  other  agreement,   instrument  or  document,   or  (v)  the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 6 or elsewhere herein,  other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent


                                      136
<PAGE>

or the Issuing Lender. Neither the Agent nor the Issuing Lender shall, except to
the extent the Agent expressly  instructed by the Required  Lenders with respect
to collateral security hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, be required
to initiate or conduct any  litigation  or collection  proceedings  hereunder or
under any other Loan Document;  PROVIDED,  however,  that the Agent shall not be
required to take any action  which  exposes the Agent to personal  liability  or
which is contrary to the Loan Documents or applicable law.

         10.4.  RELIANCE  BY AGENT.  The Agent and the Issuing  Lender  shall be
entitled to rely upon,  and shall not incur any liability for relying upon,  any
notice, request, certificate,  consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing  believed  by it to be  genuine  and to have been  signed or sent by the
proper Person. The Agent and the Issuing Lender also may rely upon any statement
made to it orally or by  telephone  and  believed by it to be made by the proper
Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agent and the
Issuing Lender may consult with legal counsel, independent accountants and other
experts  selected  by it, and shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or not
taken by it in accordance  with the advice of any such counsel,  accountants  or
experts. The Agent and the Issuing Lender shall be fully justified in failing or
refusing  to take any action  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders
(or, if so specified by this Agreement,  all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or
it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all  liability  and  expense  which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing  to take any such  action (it being  understood  that this  provision
shall not  release  the Agent from  performing  any action  with  respect to the
Borrower  expressly required to be performed by it pursuant to the terms hereof)
under this  Agreement.  The Agent and the Issuing  Lender  shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting,  or in refraining  from acting,  under this Agreement
and the other  Loan  Documents  in  accordance  with a request  of the  Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement,  all Lenders),  and such request
and any action  taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto  shall be binding upon
all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

         10.5. ACTION THROUGH  SUB-AGENTS.  The Agent and the Issuing Lender may
perform any and all of its duties,  and  exercise  its rights and powers,  by or
through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent or the Issuing Lender.
The Agent and the Issuing  Lender and any such sub-agent may perform any and all
its duties and exercise its rights and powers through its Related  Parties.  The
exculpatory  provisions  of the  preceding  paragraphs  shall  apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and the Issuing Lender and any
such  sub-agent,  and  shall  apply to its  activities  in  connection  with the
syndication of the credit  facilities  provided for herein as well as activities
of the Agent or the Issuing Lender.

         10.6.  RESIGNATION OF AGENT AND APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR AGENT. Subject
to the  appointment  and  acceptance of a successor  Agent,  as provided in this
paragraph,  the  Agent may  resign at any time by  notifying  the  Lenders,  the
Issuing Lender and the Credit Parties.  Upon any such resignation,  the Required
Lenders  shall have the right,  in  consultation  with the  Credit  Parties,  to


                                      137
<PAGE>

appoint a successor  Agent.  If no successor  shall have been so  appointed  and
shall have accepted such  appointment  within 30 days after such retiring  Agent
gives notice of its resignation,  then such retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank
with an office in Boston,  Massachusetts  or New York, New York, or an Affiliate
of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder,  by
a successor,  such  successor  shall  succeed to and become  vested with all the
rights,  powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,  and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged  from its duties and  obligations  hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor  unless  otherwise  agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder,
the provisions of this Article and Section 11.3 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such retiring  Agent,  its  sub-agents and their  respective  Related
Parties in respect  of any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while it was acting as Agent.

         10.7. LENDERS' INDEPENDENT DECISIONS.  Each Lender acknowledges that it
has,  independently  and without  reliance upon the Agent, the Issuing Lender or
any other Lender and based on such  documents and  information  as it has deemed
appropriate,  made its own  credit  analysis  and  decision  to enter  into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance  upon the Agent,  the Issuing  Lender or any other  Lender and based on
such documents and  information as it shall from time to time deem  appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  any related  agreement or any
document  furnished  hereunder  or  thereunder.  Except as  explicitly  provided
herein, neither the Agent nor the Issuing Lender has any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit
or other  information  with  respect  to such  operations,  business,  property,
condition  or   creditworthiness,   whether  such  information  comes  into  its
possession  on or before the first  Event of Default or at any time  thereafter.
Neither  the Agent nor the  Issuing  Lender  shall be deemed a trustee  or other
fiduciary on behalf of any party.

         10.8.  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each  Lender  agrees  to  indemnify  and  hold
harmless the Agent and the Issuing  Lender (to the extent not  reimbursed  under
Section 11.3, but without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under Section
11.3),  ratably  in  accordance  with  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the
respective Commitments of and/or Loans and Total LC Exposure held by the Lenders
(or, if all of the Commitments shall have been terminated or expired, ratably in
accordance  with the  aggregate  outstanding  amount  of the  Loans and Total LC
Exposure held by the Lenders),  for any and all liabilities  (including pursuant
to any Environmental Law),  obligations,  losses, damages,  penalties,  actions,
judgments, deficiencies, suits, costs, expenses (including the fees and expenses
of  attorneys,  consultants,  appraisers,  examiners,  and  other  professionals
engaged by the Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the administration
of the credit facilities  contemplated  hereby) or disbursements of any kind and
nature  whatsoever that may be imposed on,  incurred by or asserted  against the
Agent or the  Issuing  Lender  (including  by any  Lender)  arising out of or by
reason of any  investigation  in or in any way relating to or arising out of any


                                      138
<PAGE>

Loan Document or any other documents  contemplated by or referred to therein for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent or the Issuing Lender under
or in  respect  of any of the Loan  Documents  or other  such  documents  or the
transactions  contemplated  thereby  (including  the costs and expenses that the
Borrower is obligated to pay under  Section 11.3) or the  enforcement  of any of
the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other  documents;  PROVIDED  HOWEVER,
that no Lender  shall be liable for any of the  foregoing to the extent they are
determined  by a court of competent  jurisdiction  in a final and  nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
party to be  indemnified.  The  agreements  set forth in this Section 10.8 shall
survive the payment of all Loans and other obligations hereunder and shall be in
addition to and not in lieu of any other indemnification agreements contained in
any other Loan Document.

         10.9. CONSENTS UNDER OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. Except as otherwise provided
in this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents,  the Agent may, with the prior
consent  of  the  Required   Lenders  (but  not   otherwise),   consent  to  any
modification, supplement or waiver under any of the other Loan Documents.

         10.10.  DELINQUENT  LENDERS.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,  any Lender that
fails  to make  available  to the  Agent  its pro  rata  share of any Loan or to
purchase  any  participation  in any Letter of Credit  as,  when and to the full
extent required by the provisions of this Agreement,  shall be deemed delinquent
(a "DELINQUENT  LENDER") and shall be deemed a Delinquent Lender until such time
as such  delinquency is satisfied.  A Delinquent  Lender shall be deemed to have
assigned  any and all  payments  due to it from the Credit  Parties,  whether on
account of outstanding Loans, unpaid Reimbursement  Obligations,  interest, fees
or otherwise,  to the remaining  nondelinquent  Lenders for  application to, and
reduction  of, their  respective  pro rata shares of all  outstanding  Loans and
unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligations.  The Delinquent Lender hereby authorizes the
Agent to distribute such payments to the nondelinquent  Lenders in proportion to
their   respective  pro  rata  shares  of  all  outstanding   Loans  and  unpaid
Reimbursement Obligations. A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied
in full a delinquency  when and if, as a result of  application  of the assigned
payments to all outstanding  Loans and unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligations of the
nondelinquent   Lenders,   the  Lenders'  respective  pro  rata  shares  of  all
outstanding Loans and unpaid Reimbursement Obligations have returned to those in
effect  immediately  prior to such  delinquency and without giving effect to the
nonpayment causing such delinquency.

         10.11. ELECTRONIC  COMMUNICATIONS.  The Credit Parties hereby authorize
and request the Agent,  the Cash  Management  Bank,  the  Canadian  Lender,  the
Issuing  Lender  or any of  their  Affiliates  to act on  instructions  given by
telephone, telegraph, telefax, cable, wireless, telex, telecopy, electronic mail
or other similar  electronic means of communication  (collectively,  "ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS")  from  an  authorized  representative  of  such  Credit  Party,
including  but  not  limited  to  instructions  relating  to  the  issuance  and
processing of letters of credit and  collection  transactions  and other similar
trade  finance  products,  the execution of foreign  exchange  contracts and the
directing the payment of moneys and transfers, deposits or withdrawals of funds,
coins,  precious  metals,  securities and other  valuable  assets from or to any


                                      139
<PAGE>

account  maintained by the Agent, the Cash Management Bank, the Canadian Lender,
the Issuing  Lender or such  Affiliate as  contemplated  under this Agreement on
behalf of such Credit Party.  Each Credit Party further  authorizes  and directs
the Agent, Cash Management Bank, Canadian Lender, Issuing Lender or any of their
Affiliates  to  respond  to any  inquiry  made  through  any  of the  Electronic
Communications  relating to the status of any account  maintained  by the Agent,
the Cash  Management  Bank,  the  Canadian  Lender,  the Issuing  Lender or such
Affiliate as  contemplated  under this  Agreement.  Each of the Agent,  the Cash
Management  Bank,  the  Canadian  Lender,  the  Issuing  Lender  or any of their
Affiliates, any branch or agency thereof and its respective directors,  officers
and employees shall not be liable for any error, delay,  damage,  claim or other
loss,  expense  or cost  arising  out of any  instruction  given  by  Electronic
Communications.   All  such  risks  are  assumed  by  the  Credit  Parties.  All
instructions  sent by telex shall contain the Credit  Parties'  answerback.  The
certifications, authorizations, directions and any restrictions contained herein
will continue until the Agent,  the Cash Management Bank, the Canadian Lender or
the Issuing Lender actually  receive written notice of any change or revocation.
The Agent,  the Cash Management Bank, the Canadian Lender and the Issuing Lender
shall have the right to refuse any instructions  through any of  above-mentioned
Electronic communications, in its/their discretion.

         11.2.  WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS.

                  (a) No failure or delay by the Agent, the Issuing Lender,  the
         Canadian Lender,  the Cash Management Bank or the Lenders in exercising
         any right or power  hereunder  shall operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor
         shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
         abandonment  or  discontinuance  of  steps to  enforce  such a right or
         power,  preclude any other or further  exercise thereof or the exercise
         of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Agent, the
         Issuing Lender,  the Cash Management Bank and the Lenders hereunder and
         under the other Loan  Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of
         any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any
         provision of this  Agreement or consent to any  departure by any Credit
         Party or Subsidiary  therefrom  shall in any event be effective  unless
         the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 11.2,  and
         then such waiver or consent  shall be  effective  only in the  specific
         instance  and for the purpose for which  given.  Without  limiting  the
         generality  of the  foregoing,  the making of a Loan or  issuance  of a
         Letter of Credit  shall not be  construed  as a waiver of any  Default,
         regardless of whether the Agent,  any Lender or the Issuing  Lender may
         have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
         provision  hereof or thereof may be waived,  amended or modified except
         pursuant to an agreement or agreements  in writing  entered into by the
         Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Agent with
         the written  consent of the  Required  Lenders and the Agent;  PROVIDED
         that no such agreement shall:.

                           (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
                  written consent of such Lender and the Agent;

                           (ii)  reduce  the  principal  amount  of any  Loan or
                  Reimbursement  Obligation  or  reduce  the  rate  of  interest
                  thereon (other than the decision not to charge, or to cease to
                  charge,  Post-Default  Interest),  or reduce any fees  payable
                  hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
                  thereby;

                           (iii)  postpone the scheduled  date of payment of the
                  principal  amount  of any  Loan  or  Reimbursement  Obligation


                                      141
<PAGE>

                  (which  excludes  mandatory  prepayments of the Loans required
                  under Section 2.8(b)),  or any interest  thereon,  or any fees
                  payable  hereunder,  or reduce the amount of,  waive or excuse
                  any such  payment,  change the maturity  date of any Loan,  or
                  postpone the scheduled  date of expiration of any  Commitment,
                  or extend the ultimate expiration date of any Letter of Credit
                  beyond the Maturity Date,  without the written consent of each
                  Lender affected thereby;

                           (iv) change  subsection 2.8(c) in a manner that would
                  alter the  application  of prepayments  thereunder,  or change
                  subsections  2.7(c),  (d) or (e) in a manner  that would alter
                  the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,  without in
                  each case the written consent of each Lender;

                           (v) alter the rights or  obligations  of the Borrower
                  to prepay Loans  (other than  mandatory  prepayments  of Loans
                  under  subsection  2.8(b)) without the written consent of each
                  Lender;

                           (vi)  change any of the  provisions  of this  Section
                  11.2 or the  definition  of  "Required  Lenders"  or any other
                  provision  hereof  specifying  the  number  or  percentage  of
                  Lenders  required  to  waive,   amend  or  modify  any  rights
                  hereunder  or  under  any  other  Loan  Document  or make  any
                  determination  or grant any consent  hereunder or  thereunder,
                  without the written consent of each Lender;

                           (vii)  release  all  or  substantially   all  of  the
                  Guarantors from their  obligations in respect of its Guarantee
                  under  Article 3 or release  all or  substantially  all of the
                  Collateral  (or  terminate  any Lien  with  respect  thereto),
                  except as expressly  permitted in this Agreement,  without the
                  written consent of each Lender;

                           (viii)   waive  any  of  the   conditions   precedent
                  specified  in Section 6.1 without the written  consent of each
                  Lender and the Agent;

                           (x) subordinate the Loans to any other Indebtedness;

                           (xi) increase the  percentage  of Eligible  Accounts,
                  Eligible  Inventory  or Appraised  Value of the Canadian  Real
                  Property (as  applicable)  in the  calculation of the Canadian
                  Borrowing  Base or the Domestic  Borrowing  Base,  without the
                  written consent of each Lender; or

                           (xii) amend the  definitions  of "Domestic  Borrowing
                  Base" or "Canadian Borrowing Base" or of any definition of any
                  component thereof, such that more credit would be available to
                  the  Borrower  or the  Canadian  Borrowers,  based on the same
                  assets,  as would have been  available  to the Borrower or the
                  Canadian  Borrowers  immediately  prior to such amendment,  it
                  being understood,  however,  that: the foregoing shall not (A)
                  limit  the  adjustment  by the  Agent  of any  reserve  in the


                                      142
<PAGE>

                  Agent's  administration of the Loans as otherwise permitted by
                  this Agreement or (B) prevent the Agent, in its administration
                  of  the  Loans,  from  restoring  any  component  of  Domestic
                  Borrowing  Base  or  Canadian  Borrowing  Base  or  Term  Loan
                  Borrowing Base which had been lowered by the Agent back to the
                  value of such component,  as stated in this Agreement or to an
                  intermediate value;

PROVIDED further that no such agreement shall amend,  modify or otherwise affect
the rights or duties of the Agent or the Issuing  Lender  hereunder  without the
prior written consent of the Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be.

         11.3.  EXPENSES; INDEMNITY: DAMAGE WAIVER.

         transfers,  checks  or  other  items,  (v)  any  action  taken  by such
         Indemnitee in accordance with instructions  given to such Indemnitee by
         Electronic  Communications,  whether arising out of any  investigation,

         behalf of such Credit Party,  by any third party or by any  successors,
         or assigns such Credit Party and  notwithstanding the fact that (A) the
         instructions  received by such Indemnitee might have been  unauthorized
         by such Credit Party or (B) such Indemnitee  might have  misinterpreted
         said instructions or made any other error, mistake or omission,  absent
         gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct,   or  (vi)  any  actual  or
         prospective claim  (including,  but not limited to, claims with respect
         to wrongful death, personal injury or damage to property),  litigation,
         investigation,  Environmental  Actions or proceeding relating to any of
         the foregoing,  whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and

         service  mark or similar  right of any Credit  Party  comprised  in the
         Collateral;   PROVIDED  that  such  indemnity  shall  not,  as  to  any
         Indemnitee,  be  available  to the  extent  that such  losses,  claims,
         damages,  liabilities or related  expenses are determined by a court of
         competent  jurisdiction  by final and  nonappealable  judgment  to have
         resulted  from the  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of such
         Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the  extent  that the  Credit  Parties  fail to pay any
         amount  required to be paid by them to the Agent under paragraph (a) or
         (b) of this Section 11.3,  each Lender  severally  agrees to pay to the
         Agent such Lender's  Applicable  Percentage  (determined as of the time
         that the  applicable  unreimbursed  expense  or  indemnity  payment  is
         sought) of such unpaid  amount.  To the extent that the Credit  Parties
         fail  to pay any  amount  required  to be  paid by them to the  Issuing
         Lender under  paragraph  (a) or (b) of this Section  11.3,  each Lender
         severally agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender such Lender's  Applicable
         Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable  unreimbursed
         expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount.

                  (d) TO THE EXTENT  PERMITTED BY  APPLICABLE  LAW,  NONE OF THE
         CREDIT PARTIES SHALL ASSERT,  AND EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY WAIVES,  ANY
         CLAIM AGAINST ANY INDEMNITEE,  ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, FOR SPECIAL,
         INDIRECT,  CONSEQUENTIAL  OR PUNITIVE  DAMAGES (AS OPPOSED TO DIRECT OR
         ACTUAL DAMAGES)  ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR AS A RESULT OF,
         THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT
         CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY,  THE TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
         ANY LOAN OR LETTER OF CREDIT OR THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS THEREOF.

         promptly after written demand therefor.

                  (f) In the  event  that any  investigation,  site  monitoring,
         containment, clean-up, removal, transportation,  disposal, restoration,
         reporting,  or sampling  with respect to  Hazardous  Materials or soil,
         water,  tanks,  drums or other  materials  which  contain or  contained
         Hazardous   Materials  (a  "REMEDIAL  WORK")  is  necessary  under  any
         applicable  local,  state or federal law or  regulation,  any  judicial
         order,  or by any  governmental  or  non-governmental  entity or Person
         because of, or in  connection  with,  the  current or future  presence,
         suspected  presence,  release or suspected release or threat of release
         of Hazardous Materials in or into the air, soil, ground water,  surface
         water or soil vapor at, on,  about,  under,  within,  near,  from or in
         connection with any Real Property Asset (or any portion  thereof),  the
         Credit Parties shall promptly commence,  or cause to be commenced,  and
         thereafter diligently prosecute to completion,  all such Remedial Work.
         All Remedial Work shall be performed by licensed contractors  qualified
         to perform such work under applicable federal, state and local law. All
         Environmental  Costs related to such Remedial Work shall be paid by the
         Credit Parties including, without limitation,  reasonable Environmental
         Costs incurred by any  Indemnitee in connection  with the monitoring or
         review of such Remedial Work by the Indemnitee or a third party engaged
         by  Indemnitee.  In the event the Credit Parties shall fail to promptly
         commence, or cause to be commenced,  or fail to diligently prosecute to
         completion,  such  Remedial  Work,  the  Agent  may,  but  shall not be
         required  to,  cause  such  Remedial  Work  to  be  performed  and  all
         Environmental Costs shall become an Environmental Liability hereunder.

         11.4.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
         inure  to the  benefit  of the  parties  hereto  and  their  respective
         successors and assigns  permitted  hereby,  except that no Credit Party
         may  assign or  otherwise  transfer  any of its  rights or  obligations
         hereunder  without  the prior  written  consent of each  Lender and the
         Agent (and any attempted  assignment  or transfer  without such consent
         shall  be null and  void).  Nothing  in this  Agreement,  expressed  or
         implied,  shall be construed to confer upon any Person  (other than the
         parties  hereto,  their  respective  successors  and assigns  permitted
         hereby and, to the extent expressly  contemplated  hereby,  the Related
         Parties of the Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Canadian Lender, the Cash
         Management Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable  right,  remedy
         or claim under or by reason of this  Agreement.

                  (b) Each  Lender may at any time and from time to time  assign
         to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations
         under  this  Agreement  (including  all or a portion  of the  Revolving
         Credit Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); PROVIDED that
         for any assignment:

                           (i) except in the case of an  assignment  to a Lender
                  prior to such  assignment  or an Affiliate of such a Lender or
                  an Approved  Fund (in which case,  the  assignee  and assignor
                  Lenders shall give notice of the assignment to the Agent), the


                                      146
<PAGE>

                  Borrower and the Agent (and,  in the case of an  assignment of
                  all or a portion of a Commitment  or any Lender's  obligations
                  in respect of its Total LC Exposure,  the Issuing Lender) each
                  must give its prior written consent to such assignment  (which
                  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,   delayed  or
                  conditioned),

                           (ii) except in the case of an  assignment to a Lender
                  or an Affiliate or Approved  Fund of a Lender or an assignment
                  of the  entire  remaining  amount  of the  assigning  Lender's
                  aggregate Commitments, the aggregate amount of the Commitments
                  of the  assigning  Lender  subject  to  each  such  assignment
                  (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance  with
                  respect to such  assignment  is  delivered to the Agent) shall
                  not be less than $5,000,000  unless the Borrower and the Agent
                  otherwise consent,

                           (iii) each Lender shall assign its  Revolving  Credit
                  Commitment,  Revolving  Loans,  and  Term  Loan  in  the  same
                  proportions, such that after giving effect to such assignment,
                  the Assignor's  Applicable  Percentage of the Revolving Credit
                  Commitments  and  Revolving  Loans  shall  be the  same as the
                  Assignor's Applicable Percentage of the outstanding Term Loan,
                  and the  Assignee's  Applicable  Percentage  of the  Revolving
                  Credit  Commitments  and Revolving  Loans shall be the same as
                  the Assignee's  Applicable  Percentage of the outstanding Term
                  Loan,

                           (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
                  deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, and, unless
                  such  assignment  is to a Lender or its  Affiliate or Approved
                  Fund,  shall pay a processing and  recordation  fee of $3,500,
                  and

                           (v) the assignee,  if it shall not be a Lender, shall
                  deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;

                  PROVIDED  further that any consent of the  Borrower  otherwise
         required  under this  paragraph  shall not be  required  if an Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing or in the event of an assignment
         to an existing Lender.

                  (c) Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (e) of
         this Section 11.4,  from and after the effective date specified in each
         Assignment and  Acceptance,  the assignee  thereunder  shall be a party
         hereto and, to the extent of the interest  assigned by such  Assignment
         and Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
         Agreement,  and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
         the interest  assigned by such Assignment and  Acceptance,  be released
         from its  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the case of an
         Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations  under this Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a
         party  hereto but shall  continue  to be  entitled  to the  benefits of


                                      147
<PAGE>

         Sections 2.10,  2.11 and 11.3 and subsection  2.3(e)).  Notwithstanding
         anything therein to the contrary, no Approved Fund shall be entitled to
         receive any  greater  amount  pursuant  to  Sections  2.10 and 2.11 and
         subsection  2.3(e) than the transferor  Lender would have been entitled
         to receive in respect of the  assignment  effected  by such  transferor
         Lender had no  assignment  occurred.  Any  assignment  or transfer by a
         Lender of rights or  obligations  under  this  Agreement  that does not
         comply with  paragraph  (b) of this  Section  11.4 shall be treated for
         purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a  participation
         in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (f) of this
         Section.

                  (d) The  Agent,  acting  for this  purpose  as an agent of the
         Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Boston, Massachusetts
         a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register
         for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,  and the
         Commitment of, and principal  amount of the Loans and LC  Disbursements
         owing to,  each Lender  pursuant to the terms  hereof from time to time
         (the "REGISTER").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and
         the Borrower,  the Agent,  the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may treat
         each  Person  whose name is recorded  in the  Register  pursuant to the
         terms hereof as a Lender  hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
         for  inspection by the Borrower,  the Issuing  Lender and any Lender or
         the Agent, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
         prior notice.

                  (e)  Upon  its  receipt  of a duly  completed  Assignment  and
         Acceptance  executed by an assigning  Lender and an assignee,  together
         with each Note subject to such  assignment,  the  assignee's  completed
         Administrative  Questionnaire  (unless the assignee  shall already be a
         Lender  hereunder),  the processing and  recordation fee referred to in
         paragraph  (b) of this  Section  11.4 and any  written  consent to such
         assignment  required by paragraph (b) of this Section  11.4,  the Agent
         shall accept such  Assignment and  Acceptance,  record the  information
         contained therein in the Register and give prompt notice thereof to the
         Borrower  and  the  Lenders  (other  than  the  assigning  Lender).  No
         assignment  shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it
         has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. Within
         five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice,  the Borrower,  at
         its own expense,  shall  execute and deliver to the Agent,  in exchange
         for each surrendered  Note, a new Note to the order of such assignee in
         an amount equal to the amount assumed by such assignee pursuant to such
         Assignment  and  Acceptance  and, if the assigning  Lender has retained
         some portion of its obligations  hereunder,  a new Note to the order of
         the  assigning  Lender in an amount equal to the amount  retained by it
         hereunder.  Such new Notes shall provide that they are replacements for
         the surrendered Notes, shall be in an aggregate  principal amount equal
         to the aggregate  principal amount of the surrendered  Notes,  shall be
         dated the effective  date of such  Assignment  and Acceptance and shall
         otherwise be in substantially the form of the assigned Notes.

                  (f) Any Lender  may,  without  the consent of or notice to the
         Borrower,  the Agent or the Issuing Lender,  sell participations to one
         or more banks or other entities (a  "PARTICIPANT")  in all or a portion
         of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
         all or a  portion  of its  Commitments  and  the  Loans  owing  to it);
         PROVIDED that (i) such Lender's  obligations under this Agreement shall
         remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely  responsible to
         the other parties hereto for the  performance of such  obligations  and
         (iii) the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders
         shall  continue  to deal  solely  and  directly  with  such  Lender  in
         connection  with  such  Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this
         Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
         such a  participation  shall  provide that such Lender shall retain the
         sole right to enforce  this  Agreement  and to approve  any  amendment,
         modification  or waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement;  PROVIDED
         that such  agreement  or  instrument  may provide that such Lender will
         not,  without the consent of the  Participant,  agree to any amendment,
         modification  or waiver  described  in the  first  proviso  to  Section
         11.2(b), or in Section 11.2(c), that affects such Participant.  Subject
         to paragraph  (g) of this Section 11.4,  the Borrower  agrees that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.11
         and subsection 2.3(e) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
         acquired its interest by  assignment  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
         Section 11.4.

                  (g) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
         payment  under  Section 2.10 or 2.11 than the  applicable  Lender would
         have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
         such  Participant,  unless  the  sale  of  the  participation  to  such
         Participant  is made  with the  Borrower's  prior  written  consent.  A
         Participant  that would be a Foreign  Lender if it were a Lender  shall
         not be entitled to the  benefits of Section 2.11 unless the Borrower is
         notified  of the  participation  sold  to  such  Participant  and  such
         Participant  agrees,  for the benefit of the  Borrower,  to comply with
         subsection 2.11(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (h) Any  Lender  may at any time  pledge or assign a  security
         interest in all or any portion of its rights  under this  Agreement  to
         secure  obligations  of such  Lender,  including  any  such  pledge  or
         assignment to a Federal  Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply
         to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;  PROVIDED that
         no such pledge or  assignment  of a security  interest  shall release a
         Lender from any of its  obligations  hereunder or  substitute  any such
         assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (i)   Anything   in  this   Section   11.4  to  the   contrary
         notwithstanding,  no Lender may assign or  participate  any interest in
         any  Loan  held  by it  hereunder  to any  Credit  Party  or any of its
         Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender and
         the Agent.

                  (j) A Lender may furnish any information concerning any Credit
         Party or any of its  Subsidiaries in the possession of such Lender from
         time to time  to  assignees  and  participants  (including  prospective
         assignees and  participants) subject,   however,  to and so long as the


                                      149
<PAGE>

         recipient  agrees in writing to be bound by, the  provisions of Section
         11.13. In addition,  the Agent may furnish any  information  concerning
         any Credit  Party,  any of its  Subsidiaries,  or any  Affiliate in the
         Agent's possession to any Affiliate of the Agent, subject,  however, to
         the  provisions of Section  11.13.  The Credit Parties shall assist any
         Lender in effectuating any assignment or participation pursuant to this
         Section 11.4  (including  during  syndication)  in whatever manner such
         Lender reasonably deems necessary,  including participation in meetings
         with prospective transferees.

                  (k) If any  assignee  Lender  is an  Affiliate  of the  Credit
         Parties, then any such assignee Lender shall have no right to vote as a
         Lender  hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for purposes
         of  granting  consents  or  waivers  or for  purposes  of  agreeing  to
         amendments or other  modifications  to any of the Loan Documents or for
         purposes of making  requests to the Agent  pursuant to Section 9.1, and
         the  determination  of the Required  Lenders  shall for all purposes of
         this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents be made without regard to
         such assignee  Lender's  interest in any of the Loans or  Reimbursement
         Obligations. If any Lender sells a participating interest in any of the
         Loans  or  Reimbursement   Obligations  to  a  Participant,   and  such
         Participant  is any Credit Party or an Affiliate of such Credit  Party,
         then such transferor Lender shall promptly notify the Agent of the sale
         of such participation.  A transferor Lender shall have no right to vote
         as a Lender  hereunder  or under any of the other  Loan  Documents  for
         purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of agreeing to
         amendments  or  modifications  to  any  of the  Loan  Documents  or for
         purposes of making requests to the Agent pursuant to Section 9.1 to the
         extent  that such  participation  is  beneficially  owned by any Credit
         Party or any Affiliate of such Credit Party,  and the  determination of
         the Required  Lenders shall for all purposes of this  Agreement and the
         other Loan  Documents  be made  without  regard to the interest of such
         transferor  Lender in the  Loans or  Reimbursement  Obligations  to the
         extent of such participation.

                  (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
         subsection  11.4,  any  Lender  (a  "GRANTING  LENDER")  may grant to a
         special  purpose  funding  vehicle (an "SPC") of such Granting  Lender,
         identified  as such in  writing  from  time  to time  delivered  by the
         Granting  Lender to the Agent and the  Credit  Parties,  the  option to
         provide  to such  Credit  Party  all or any part of any Loan  that such
         Granting  Lender  would  otherwise  be obligated to make to such Credit
         Party  pursuant to this  Agreement,  PROVIDED  that (i) nothing  herein
         shall  constitute  a commitment  to make any Loan by any SPC,  (ii) the
         Granting   Bank's   obligations   under  this  Agreement  shall  remain
         unchanged,  (iii) the Granting  Lender  should retain the sole right to
         enforce this  Agreement and to approve any amendment,  modification  or
         waiver of any provision of this Agreement and (iv) if an SPC elects not
         to exercise  such option or otherwise  fails to provide all or any part
         of such Loan, the Granting  Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
         pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder
         shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent,


                                      150
<PAGE>

         and as if,  such Loan  were made by the  Granting  Lender.  Each  party
         hereto  hereby  agrees  that no SPC  shall be  liable  for any  expense
         reimbursement,  indemnity  or  similar  payment  obligation  under this
         Agreement  (all  liability  for which shall  remain  with the  Granting
         Lender).  In  furtherance  of the  foregoing,  each party hereto hereby
         agrees  (which   agreement   shall  survive  the  termination  of  this
         Agreement)  that,  prior to the date that is one year and one day after
         the  later  of (i)  the  payment  in  full  of all  outstanding  senior
         indebtedness  of any  SPC and  (ii)  the  Maturity  Date,  it will  not
         institute  against,  or join any other Person in  instituting  against,
         such SPC any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,  insolvency or
         liquidation  proceedings or similar  proceedings  under the laws of the
         United   States  of  America  or  any  State   thereof.   In  addition,
         notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in this subsection
         11.4(l),  any SPC may (i) with  notice  to, but  (except  as  specified
         below)  without the prior  written  consent of, any Credit Party or the
         Agent and without paying any  processing fee therefor,  assign all or a
         portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting  Lender or to any
         financial  institutions  (consented  to by the Agent and, so long as no
         Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Credit
         Party,  which consents shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed)
         providing  liquidity and/or credit  facilities to or for the account of
         such  SPC to  fund  the  Loans  made  by  such  SPC or to  support  the
         securities  (if any)  issued  by such SPC to fund  such  Loans and (ii)
         disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to
         its Loans (other than financial  statements referred to in Sections 5.4
         or 7.1) to any rating agency,  commercial paper dealer or provider of a
         surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. In no
         event  shall any Credit  Party be  obligated  to pay to an SPC that has
         made a Loan any greater  amount than such Credit  Party would have been
         obligated to pay under this  Agreement if the Granting  Lender had made
         such Loan. An amendment to this subsection  11.4(l) without the written
         consent of an SPC shall be ineffective  insofar as it alters the rights
         and obligations of such SPC.

         11.5.  SURVIVAL.   All  covenants,   agreements,   representations  and
warranties made by the Credit Parties and  Subsidiaries  herein and in the other
Loan  Documents,  and in the  certificates  or other  instruments  delivered  in
connection  with or pursuant  to this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents,
shall be  considered  to have been relied upon by the other  parties  hereto and
shall survive the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement and the other Loan
Documents  and the making of any Loans and  issuance  of any  Letters of Credit,
regardless  of any  investigation  made by any such other party or on its behalf
and  notwithstanding  that the Agent,  the Issuing Lender or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect  representation  or warranty
at the time any credit is extended  hereunder,  and shall continue in full force
and effect so long as the  principal  of or any accrued  interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other  Obligation  payable under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is outstanding  and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding  and
so long as the  Commitments  have not expired or  terminated.  The provisions of
Sections 2.10,  2.11,  10.3,  and 11.4 and  subsection  2.3(e) shall survive and
remain  in  full  force  and  effect  regardless  of  the  consummation  of  the
transactions  contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or


                                      151
<PAGE>

termination of the Letters of Credit and the  Commitments or the  termination of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.

         11.6.    COUNTERPARTS;    INTEGRATION;    REFERENCES    TO   AGREEMENT;
EFFECTIVENESS.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties  hereto on different  counterparts),  each of which shall  constitute an
original,  but all of  which  when  taken  together  shall  constitute  a single
contract.  This  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents  and any separate  letter
agreements  with respect to fees payable to the Agent or its counsel  constitute
the entire contract among the parties  relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and  understandings,  oral or written,
relating to the subject matter hereof. Whenever there is a reference in any Loan
Document  or UCC  Financing  Statement  to the "CREDIT  AGREEMENT"  to which the
Agent,  the Lenders and the Credit Parties are parties,  such reference shall be
deemed to be made to this Agreement among the parties hereto. Except as provided
in Section 6.1, this  Agreement  shall become  effective when it shall have been
executed by the Agent and when the Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
which,  when taken  together,  bear the  signatures of each of the other parties
hereto,  and  thereafter  shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties  hereto and their  respective  successors  and  assigns.  Delivery of an
executed  counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         11.7. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,  be
ineffective  to the extent of such  invalidity,  illegality or  unenforceability
without  affecting the validity,  legality and  enforceability  of the remaining
provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular  provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         11.8.  RIGHT OF SETOFF.  Each Credit Party hereby  grants to the Agent,
the Cash  Management  Bank and each Lender that from time to time  maintains any
deposit  accounts,  holds or controls  any funds,  collateral  or  property,  or
otherwise  becomes  indebted  to the Credit  Parties a security  interest in all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and funds at
any time held and other  indebtedness  at any time owing by the Agent,  the Cash
Management  Bank or any Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Credit
Party as security for the Obligations,  and the Credit Parties hereby agree that
if an Event of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing,  the Agent,  the
Cash Management Bank and each Lender are hereby  authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final) or
other funds, securities or other property of the Credit Parties at any time held
and other  indebtedness at any time owing by the Agent, the Cash Management Bank
or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Credit  Party  against
any and all of the Obligations,  irrespective of whether or not the Agent or the
Lenders shall have made any demand under this  Agreement and although any of the
Obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of the Agent, the Canadian Lender, the
Cash  Management Bank and each Lender under this Section 11.8 are in addition to
any other  rights and  remedies  (including  other  rights of setoff)  which the


                                      152
<PAGE>

Agent,  the Cash Management Bank or any such Lender may have. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO REQUIRE  THE CASH  MANAGEMENT  BANK OR ANY LENDER TO  EXERCISE  ITS RIGHTS OR
REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER  COLLATERAL  WHICH  SECURES THE  OBLIGATIONS,
PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH  DEPOSITS,  CREDITS
OR OTHER  PROPERTY OF ANY CREDIT  PARTY ARE HEREBY  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY  AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVED. Each of the Lenders agree with each other Lender that (a) if
an amount to be set off is to be applied to  Indebtedness of any Credit Party to
such Lender, other than Indebtedness  evidenced by the Notes held by such Lender
or constituting Reimbursement Obligations owed to such Lender, such amount shall
be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness  evidenced
by all such Notes held by such Lender or constituting  Reimbursement Obligations
owed to such Lender, and (b) if such Lender shall receive from any Credit Party,
whether by  voluntary  payment,  exercise of the right of setoff,  counterclaim,
cross  action,  enforcement  of the claim  evidenced  by the  Notes  held by, or
constituting  Reimbursement  Obligations  owed to,  such  Lender by  proceedings
against such Credit Party at law or in equity or by proof thereof in bankruptcy,
reorganization,  liquidation, receivership or similar proceedings, or otherwise,
and shall  retain  and  apply to the  payment  of the Note or Notes  held by, or
Reimbursement  Obligations  owed to,  such  Lender  any  amount in excess of its
ratable  portion of the payments  received by all of the Lenders with respect to
the Notes held by, and  Reimbursement  Obligations  owed to, all of the Lenders,
such Lender will make such disposition and  arrangements  with the other Lenders
with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, PRO TANTO assignment
of claims,  subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender receiving in
respect  of the  Notes  held by it or  Reimbursement  Obligations  owed it,  its
proportionate payment as contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED that if all or
any part of such excess payment is thereafter  recovered from such Lender,  such
disposition and  arrangements  shall be rescinded and the amount restored to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest.

         11.9.  SUBORDINATION BY CREDIT PARTIES. The Credit Parties hereby agree
that all present and future  Indebtedness  of any Credit Party to another Credit
Party ("INTERCOMPANY  INDEBTEDNESS") shall be subordinate and junior in right of
payment and  priority to the  Obligations,  and each Credit  Party agrees not to
make, demand,  accept or receive any payment in respect of any present or future
Intercompany Indebtedness,  including,  without limitation, any payment received
through the exercise of any right of setoff, counterclaim or cross claim, or any
collateral  therefor,  unless and until such time as the Obligations  shall have
been indefeasibly paid in full;  PROVIDED that, so long as no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing  and no Default shall be caused  thereby,  the Credit
Parties may make and receive such payments as shall be customary in the ordinary
course of the  Credit  Parties'  business.  If,  notwithstanding  the  foregoing
sentence,  any Credit  Party  shall  collect,  enforce or receive any amounts in
respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still  outstanding,  such
amounts  shall be  collected,  enforced  and  received by such  Credit  Party as
trustee  for the  Lenders  and the Agent and be paid over to the Agent,  for the
benefit of the Lenders  and the Agent,  on account of the  Obligations,  without
affecting  in any manner the  liability  of such  Credit  Party  under the other


                                      153
<PAGE>

provisions of this Agreement.  Without in any way limiting the foregoing, in the
event  of  any  insolvency  or  bankruptcy  proceedings,  or  any  receivership,
liquidation,  reorganization,  dissolution or other similar proceedings relative
to any Credit  Party or to its  businesses,  properties  or assets,  the Lenders
shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all of the  Obligations,  before
any Credit  Party  shall be  entitled  to receive  any payment in respect of any
present or future Intercompany Indebtedness.

         11.10.  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

                  (a) This Agreement  shall be construed in accordance  with and
         governed by the law of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

                  (b) Each party hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally
         submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive  jurisdiction
         of the courts of The  Commonwealth of  Massachusetts  and of the United
         States  District  Court  for the  District  of  Massachusetts,  and any
         appellate court from any thereof,  in any action or proceeding  arising
         out of or relating to this  Agreement or the other Loan  Documents,  or
         for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
         hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
         respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
         such  Massachusetts  court (or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
         Federal court). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
         in any  such  action  or  proceeding  shall  be  conclusive  and may be
         enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
         manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this  Agreement  shall  affect any
         right that the Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Canadian Lender. the Cash
         Management Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
         proceeding  relating to this Agreement  against any Credit Party or any
         of  its   Subsidiaries   or  its   properties  in  the  courts  of  any
         jurisdiction.

                  (c) Each party hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally
         waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
         objection  which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
         any suit,  action or  proceeding  arising  out of or  relating  to this
         Agreement  or the other  Loan  Documents  in any court  referred  to in
         paragraph (b) of this Section 11.10.  Each of the parties hereto hereby
         irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
         of  an  inconvenient  forum  to  the  maintenance  of  such  action  or
         proceeding in any such court.

                  (d)  Each  party to this  Agreement  irrevocably  consents  to
         service of process in the manner  provided for notices in Section 11.1.
         Nothing in this  Agreement  will  affect the right of any party to this
         Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         11.11.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,  TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING


                                      154
<PAGE>

TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED  HEREBY  (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT,  TORT OR ANY OTHER  THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES  THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,  SEEK
TO  ENFORCE  THE  FOREGOING  WAIVER AND (B)  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES  HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS  AGREEMENT  BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.11.

         11.12.  HEADINGS  AND  DRAFTING.  Article and Section  headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for  convenience  of reference  only,  are not
part of this  Agreement  and shall not affect the  construction  of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting,  this Agreement.  Each of the parties hereto
agrees that no party hereto shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement.

         11.13.  CONFIDENTIALITY.   Each  Lender  agrees  to  keep  confidential
information  obtained  by it  pursuant  hereto  and  the  other  Loan  Documents
confidential in accordance with Lender's customary  practices and agrees that it
will only use such information in connection with the transactions  contemplated
by this  Agreement  and not disclose any of such  information  other than (a) to
such  Lender's  employees,  representatives,   directors,  attorneys,  auditors,
agents,  professional  advisors,  trustees or Affiliates  who are advised of the
confidential nature of such information or to any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty's  professional
advisor (so long as such  contractual  counterparty or  professional  advisor to
such  contractual  counterparty  agrees  to be bound by the  provisions  of this
Section  11.13),  (b) to the extent such  information  presently is or hereafter
becomes available to such Lender on a non-confidential  basis from any source of
such information that is in the public domain at the time of disclosure,  (c) to
the extent disclosure is required by law (including  applicable securities law),
regulation,  subpoena or judicial order or process (PROVIDED that notice of such
requirement  or order shall be promptly  furnished to the  Borrower  unless such
notice is legally  prohibited)  or  requested  or required by bank,  securities,
insurance or investment  company  regulators  or auditors or any  administrative
body or commission to whose jurisdiction such Lender may be subject,  (d) to any
rating  agency  to the  extent  required  in  connection  with any  rating to be
assigned  to such  Lender,  (e) to  assignees  or  participants  or  prospective
assignees  or  participants  who  agree to be bound  by the  provisions  of this
Section  11.13,  (f) to the extent  required in connection  with any  litigation
between  any  Credit  Party and any  Lender  with  respect  to the Loans or this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or (g) with the Borrower's  prior written
consent.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,  the  Administrative
Agent and each Lender (and any of their respective employees, representatives or
other  agents) may disclose to any and all persons,  without  limitation  of any
kind, any information with respect to U.S. federal income tax treatment and U.S.
federal  income tax structure of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and all
materials  of any kind  (including  opinions  or other  tax  analyses)  that are
provided  to the  Administrative  Agent  or such  Lender  relating  to such  tax
treatment and tax structure.

                  (a) As of the Second Amendment and Restatement Effective Date,

         (iv) that such  representations  and warranties  relate expressly to an
