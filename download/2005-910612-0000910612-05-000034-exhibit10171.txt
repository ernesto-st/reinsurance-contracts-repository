principal amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of that
amount (except that any borrowing of Revolving Advances may be in the aggregate
amount of the unused Commitments). Within the foregoing limits and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and
reborrow Revolving Advances.

quoted rate to the Borrower on the date of such request or as soon as possible

of such Revolving Advance to be provided by such Lender.

Stated Amount, (ii) the beneficiary, and (iii) expiration date. The Borrower

payment.

subsection (j) of this Section shall apply.

the Agent of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall have
expired or been terminated, the Commitment of each Lender shall be deemed to be
utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in an amount equal to the product of
(i) such Lender's Commitment Percentage and (ii) the sum of (A) the Stated
Amount of such Letter of Credit plus (B) any related Reimbursement Obligations
then outstanding.

         (g) Agent's Duties Regarding Letters of Credit; Unconditional Nature of
Reimbursement Obligations. In examining documents presented in connection with
drawings under Letters of Credit and making payments under such Letters of
Credit against such documents, the Agent shall only be required to use the same
standard of care as it uses in connection with examining documents presented in
connection with drawings under letters of credit in which it has not sold
participations and making payments under such letters of credit. The Borrower
assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of
Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any of
the Lenders shall be responsible for (i) the form, validity, sufficiency,
accuracy, genuineness or legal effects of any document submitted by any party in
connection with the application for and issuance of or any drawing honored under
any Letter of Credit even if such document should in fact prove to be in any or
all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit, or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any
Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon
such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telex, telecopy or
otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of
technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit, or of
the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter
of Credit, or of the proceeds of any drawing under any Letter of Credit; or
(viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Agent or
the Lenders. None of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of
any of the Agent's rights or powers hereunder. Any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Agent under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not
create against the Agent any liability to the Borrower or any Lender. In this
connection, the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Agent for any
drawing made under any Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or any other applicable Letter of Credit Document under all
circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation, the following
circumstances: (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit Document or any term or provisions therein; (B) any amendment or waiver
of or any consent to departure from all or any of the Letter of Credit
Documents; (C) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
the Borrower may have at any time against the Agent, any Lender, any beneficiary
of a Letter of Credit or any other Person, whether in connection with this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in the Letter of Credit
Documents or any unrelated transaction; (D) any breach of contract or dispute
between the Borrower, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person; (E) any demand,
statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
therein or made in connection therewith being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect whatsoever; (F) any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary
of a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of
Credit; (G) payment by the Agent under the Letter of Credit against presentation
of a draft or certificate which does not strictly comply, but which does
substantially comply, with the terms of the Letter of Credit; and (H) any other
act, omission to act, delay or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the
provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable defense to or
discharge of the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations.

         (h) Amendments, Etc. The issuance by the Agent of any amendment,
supplement or other modification to any Letter of Credit shall be subject to the
same conditions applicable under this Agreement to the issuance of new Letters
of Credit (including, without limitation, that the request therefor be made
through the Agent), and no such amendment, supplement or other modification
shall be issued unless either (i) the respective Letter of Credit affected
thereby would have complied with such conditions had it originally been issued
hereunder in such amended, supplemented or modified form or (ii) the Agent and
Requisite Lenders shall have consented thereto. In connection with any such
amendment, supplement or other modification, the Borrower shall pay the fees, if
any, payable under the last sentence of Section 3.5.(c).

         (i) Lenders' Participation in Letters of Credit. Immediately upon the
issuance by the Agent of any Letter of Credit each Lender shall be deemed to
have absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the
Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to
the extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the liability of the Agent
with respect to such Letter of Credit and each Lender thereby shall absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety,
and shall be unconditionally obligated to the Agent to pay and discharge when
due, such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Agent's liability under such
Letter of Credit. In addition, upon the making of each payment by a Lender to
the Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit pursuant to the immediately
following subsection (j), such Lender shall, automatically and without any
further action on the part of the Agent or such Lender, acquire (i) a
participation in an amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation
owing to the Agent by the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit and (ii)
a participation in a percentage equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage in
any interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower in respect of such
Reimbursement Obligation (other than the Fees payable to the Agent pursuant to
the last sentence of Section 3.5.(c)).

         (j) Payment Obligation of Lenders. Each Lender severally agrees to pay
to the Agent on demand in immediately available funds in Dollars the amount of
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of each drawing paid by the Agent under each
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that in respect of any drawing under any
Letter of Credit, the maximum amount that any Lender shall be required to fund,
whether as a Revolving Advance or as a participation, shall not exceed such
Lender's Commitment Percentage of such drawing. The amount a Lender pays to the
Agent under this subsection shall be deemed to be an Advance by such Lender if,
at the time of such payment, the Borrower is not prohibited from obtaining
Advances under this Agreement. Further, any such Advance shall be a LIBOR
Advance having an Interest Period of one month unless otherwise prohibited by
this Agreement, including without limitation, the terms of Section 2.9., in
which case each such Advance shall be deemed to be a Base Rate Advance. Each
Lender's obligation to make such payments to the Agent under this subsection,
and the Agent's right to receive the same, shall be absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional and shall not be affected in any way by any circumstance
whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) the failure of any other Lender to
make its payment under this subsection, (ii) the financial condition of the
Borrower, any other Loan Party or the Parent, (iii) the existence of any Default
or Event of Default, including any Event of Default described in Sections
11.1.(e) or (f) or (iv) the termination of the Commitments. Each such payment to
the Agent shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or deduction
whatsoever.

         (k) Information to Lenders. Promptly following any change in Letters of
Credit outstanding, the Agent shall deliver to each Lender and the Borrower a
notice describing the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at
such time. Upon the request of any Lender from time to time, the Agent shall
deliver any other information reasonably requested by such Lender with respect
to each Letter of Credit then outstanding. Other than as set forth in this
subsection, the Agent shall have no duty to notify the Lenders regarding the
issuance or other matters regarding Letters of Credit issued hereunder. The
failure of the Agent to perform its requirements under this subsection shall not
relieve any Lender from its obligations under the immediately preceding
subsection (j).

Section 2.3.  Swingline Loans.

         (a) Swingline Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
including without limitation Section 2.15., the Swingline Lender agrees to make
Swingline Loans to the Borrower, during the period from the Effective Date to
but excluding the Swingline Termination Date, in an aggregate principal amount
at any one time outstanding up to, but not exceeding, $50,000,000, as such
amount may be reduced from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof. If
at any time the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans outstanding at
such time exceeds the Swingline Commitment in effect at such time, the Borrower
shall no later than 2 days following the Agent's demand pay the Agent for the
account of the Swingline Lender the amount of such excess. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
Swingline Loans hereunder.

         (b) Procedure for Borrowing Swingline Loans. The Borrower shall give
the Agent and the Swingline Lender notice of a borrowing of a Swingline Loan
pursuant to a Notice of Swingline Borrowing delivered no later than 9:00 a.m.
San Francisco time on the proposed date of such borrowing. If the Borrower
intends to repay all or any portion of such Swingline Loan with the proceeds of
Revolving Advances, then the Borrower shall also deliver to the Agent together
with such Notice of Swingline Borrowing a Notice of Borrowing for such Revolving
Advances. Not later than 10:00 a.m. San Francisco time on the date of the
requested Swingline Loan and subject to satisfaction of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article 6.2. for such borrowing, the Swingline Lender
will make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower in
Dollars, in immediately available funds, at the account specified by the
Borrower in the Notice of Swingline Borrowing.

         (c) Interest. Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate
equal to LIBOR (as such rate is referenced on the date such Swingline Loan is
made) with an Interest Period of 7 Business Days (as designated by the Borrower
in the Notice of Swingline Borrowing) plus one percent (1.0%), or at such other
rate or rates as the Borrower and the Swingline Lender may agree from time to
time in writing. All accrued and unpaid interest on Swingline Loans shall be
payable on the dates and in the manner provided in Section 2.4.

         (d) Swingline Loan Amounts, Etc. Each Swingline Loan shall be in the
minimum amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof,
or such other minimum amounts agreed to by the Swingline Lender and the
Borrower. Any voluntary prepayment of a Swingline Loan must be in integral
multiples of $1,000 or the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Swingline Loans (or such other minimum amounts upon which the Swingline Lender
and the Borrower may agree) and in connection with any such prepayment, the
Borrower must give the Swingline Lender prior notice thereof no later than 10:00
a.m. San Francisco time on the day prior to the date of such prepayment. The
Swingline Loans shall, in addition to this Agreement, be evidenced by the
Swingline Note.

         (e) Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans. The Borrower
agrees to repay each Swingline Loan within 2 Business Days of demand therefor by
the Swingline Lender and, in any event, within 7 Business Days after the date
such Swingline Loan was made; provided, however, that if such Swingline Loan is
made for the sole purpose of compensating for a deficiency in a requested
Revolving Advance created by a Defaulting Lender, or a Lender shall fail to
purchase an interest in a portion of a Swingline Loan required to be acquired by
such Lender hereunder, then such Swingline Loan (or portion thereof) must be
repaid within 60 Business Days after the date such Swingline Loan was made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding
principal amount of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Swingline Loans
on the Swingline Termination Date (or such earlier date as the Swingline Lender
and the Borrower may agree in writing). In lieu of demanding repayment of any
outstanding Swingline Loan from the Borrower, the Swingline Lender may, on
behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to
act on its behalf), request a borrowing of LIBOR Advances from the Lenders in an
amount equal to the principal balance of such Swingline Loan and having an
initial Interest Period of one month; provided, however, if at such time the
Borrower is not permitted to borrow LIBOR Advances, then such borrowing shall be
Base Rate Advances. The amount limitations contained in the second sentence of
Section 2.1. shall not apply to any borrowing of Revolving Advances made
pursuant to this subsection. The Swingline Lender shall give notice to the Agent
of any such borrowing of Revolving Advances not later than 10:00 a.m. San
Francisco time at least one Business Day prior to the proposed date of such
borrowing. Each Lender will make available to the Agent at the Principal Office
for the account of the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the
proceeds of the Revolving Advance to be made by such Lender. The Agent shall pay
the proceeds of such Revolving Advances to the Swingline Lender, which shall
apply such proceeds to repay such Swingline Loan. If the Lenders are prohibited
from making Advances required to be made under this subsection for any reason
whatsoever, including without limitation, the occurrence of any of the Defaults
or Events of Default described in Sections 11.1.(e) or (f), each Lender shall
purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
interest and participation to the extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage
of such Swingline Loan, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline
Loan in such amount and paying the proceeds thereof to the Agent for the account
of the Swingline Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds. A
Lender's obligation to purchase such a participation in a Swingline Loan shall
be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) any claim of setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other Person may
have or claim against the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Person
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default
(including without limitation, any of the Defaults or Events of Default
described in Sections 11.1.(e) or (f)), or the termination of any Lender's
Commitment, (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of an event or condition
which has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of any
Loan Document by the Agent, any Lender or the Borrower or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing. If such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline
Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such
amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for
each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lender's demand
therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the required payment, the
Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans
in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the
Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other Lenders to
purchase a participation therein). Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have
assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Advances,
and any other amounts due it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund
Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such
Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section until such amount has been
purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise).

Section 2.4.  Rates and Payment of Interest on Advances.

         (a) Rates. The Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the account of
each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Advance
made by such Lender for the period from and including the date of the making of
such Revolving Advance to but excluding the date such Revolving Advance shall be
paid in full, at the following per annum rates:

                  (i) during such periods as such Revolving Advance is a Base
         Rate Advance, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time); and

                  (ii) during such periods as such Revolving Advance is a LIBOR
         Advance, at LIBOR for such Revolving Advance for the Interest Period
         therefor, plus 1.0%.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, while any Event of Default shall exist, the
Borrower shall, upon and after the Agent's demand, pay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender interest at the Default Rate on the outstanding principal
amount of any Advance made by such Lender, on all Reimbursement Obligations and
on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by
such Lender to or for the account of such Lender (including without limitation,
accrued but unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Applicable Law).

         (b) Payment of Interest. All accrued and unpaid interest on the
outstanding principal amount of each Advance shall be payable (i) monthly in
arrears on the first day of each month, commencing with the first full calendar
month occurring after the Effective Date and (ii) on any date on which the
principal balance of such Advance is due and payable in full (whether at
maturity, due to acceleration or otherwise). Interest payable at the Default
Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand. All determinations by the
Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the
Lenders and the Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error.

Section 2.5.  Number of Interest Periods.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
there may be no more than 8 different Interest Periods outstanding at the same
time.

Section 2.6.  Repayment of Advances.

         The Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding principal amount of,
and all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Revolving Advances on the
Termination Date.

Section 2.7.  Prepayments.

         (a) Optional. Subject to Section 5.4., the Borrower may prepay any
Advance at any time without premium or penalty. The Borrower shall give the
Agent at least 3 Business Days prior notice of the prepayment of any Advance.
Each voluntary prepayment of Revolving Advances shall be in an aggregate minimum
amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

         (b) Mandatory.

                  (i) Commitment Overadvance. If at any time the aggregate
         principal amount of all outstanding Advances, together with the
         aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, exceeds the
         aggregate amount of the Commitments, the Borrower shall no later than 2
         days following the Agent's demand, pay to the Agent for the account of
         the Lenders, the amount of such excess.

                  (ii) Borrowing Base Overadvance. If at any time the aggregate
         principal amount of all outstanding Advances, together with the
         aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, exceeds the
         Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, within 30 days of the earlier of
         (A) receipt by the Borrower of notice from the Agent stating that such
         excess exists or (B) the date the Borrower delivers (or was required to
         deliver) a Borrowing Base Certificate indicating the existence of such
         excess, deliver to the Agent for prompt distribution to each Lender a
         written plan acceptable to all of the Lenders to eliminate such excess.
         If such excess is not eliminated within 90 days of the earlier of
         receipt by the Borrower of such notice or the date the Borrower
         delivers (or was required to deliver) such Borrowing Base Certificate,
         an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred hereunder.

All payments under this subsection (b) shall be applied to pay all amounts of
excess principal outstanding on the applicable Advances and any applicable
Reimbursement Obligations in accordance with Section 3.2., and the remainder, if
any, shall be paid to the Borrower or whomever else may be legally entitled to
such remainder.

Section 2.8.  Late Charges.

         So long as the Default Rate is not payable with respect to the
Obligations as provided in Section 2.4., if any payment required under this
Agreement is not paid within 15 days after it becomes due and payable, the
Borrower shall pay a late charge for late payment to compensate the Lenders for
the loss of use of funds and for the expenses of handling the delinquent
payment, in an amount equal to three percent (3.0%) of such delinquent payment.
Such late charge shall be paid in any event not later than the due date of the
next subsequent installment of principal and/or interest. In the event the
maturity of the Obligations hereunder occurs or is accelerated pursuant to
Section 11.2., this Section shall apply only to payments overdue prior to the
time of such acceleration. This Section shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
the Lenders' right to accelerate payment of any of the Obligations as permitted
under the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.9. Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Advances; Limitation on Base Rate
Advances.

         (a) Continuation of LIBOR Advances. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the immediately
following subsection (c), the Borrower may on any Business Day, with respect to
any LIBOR Advance, elect to maintain such LIBOR Advance or any portion thereof
as a LIBOR Advance by selecting a new Interest Period for such LIBOR Advance.
Each new Interest Period selected under this Section shall commence on the last
day of the immediately preceding Interest Period. Each selection of a new
Interest Period shall be made by the Borrower giving to the Agent a Notice of
Continuation not later than 10:00 a.m. San Francisco time on the third Business
Day prior to the date of any such Continuation. Such notice by the Borrower of a
Continuation shall be in the form of a Notice of Continuation, specifying (i)
the proposed date of such Continuation, (ii) the LIBOR Advance and portion
thereof subject to such Continuation and (iii) the duration of the selected
Interest Period, all of which shall be specified in such manner as is necessary
to comply with all limitations on Advances outstanding hereunder. Each
Continuation of LIBOR Advances shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
$100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Promptly after
receipt of a Notice of Continuation, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the
proposed Continuation. If the Borrower shall fail to select in a timely manner a
new Interest Period for any LIBOR Advance in accordance with this Section, such
Advance will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period
therefor, Continue as a LIBOR Advance having an Interest Period of one month.

         (b) Conversion of LIBOR Advances. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the immediately
following subsection (c), the Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the
Borrower's giving of a Notice of Conversion to the Agent, Convert all or a
portion of an Advance of one Type into an Advance of another Type. Any
Conversion of a LIBOR Advance into a Base Rate Advance shall be made on, and
only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Advance. Each such
Notice of Conversion shall be given not later than 10:00 a.m. San Francisco time
one Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into Base Rate
Advances and three Business Days prior to the date of any proposed Conversion
into LIBOR Advances. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Agent
shall notify each Lender of the proposed Conversion. Subject to the restrictions
specified above, each Notice of Conversion shall be in the form of a Notice of
Conversion specifying (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b) the Type of
Advance to be Converted, (c) the portion of such Type of Advance to be
Converted, (d) the Type of Advance such Advance is to be Converted into and (e)
if such Conversion is into a LIBOR Advance, the requested duration of the
Interest Period of such Advance. Each Conversion of Base Rate Advances into
LIBOR Advances shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $100,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

         (c) Conditions to Conversion and Continuation. The effectiveness of (i)
the Continuation of a LIBOR Advance and (ii) the conversion of a Base Rate
Advance into a LIBOR Advance, is subject to the condition that:

                  (x) none of the following exists as of the date of such
         Continuation or Conversion and none would exist immediately after
         giving effect thereto: (A) any Default under subsection (a), (b)(i),
         (e) or (f) of Section 11.1., (B) any other Default as to which the
         Agent has given the Borrower notice and (C) an Event of Default; and

                  (y) such Continuation or Conversion is not otherwise
prohibited under this Agreement.

         (d) Limitation on Interest Period Duration During Default.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no LIBOR
Advance that may otherwise be made hereunder shall have an Interest Period
longer than one month if any Default exists.

         (e) Limitation on Base Rate Advances. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may only request Base Rate
Advances, or Convert LIBOR Advances into Base Rate Advances, under the following
circumstances:

                  (i) if the Borrower has requested a borrowing of LIBOR
         Advances having an Interest Period of at least 7, but not more than 30,
         days and at least one Lender did not consent to such Interest Period,
         then the Borrower may request that such borrowing of Advances be Base
         Rate Advances; provided, however, that the Borrower shall repay such
         Base Rate Advances in full no later than 7 calendar days after such
         Advances have been made; and

                  (ii) if the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Advances or
         to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Advances into, LIBOR Advances
         shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.2. or Section 5.3., then
         Borrower may borrow Base Rate Advances as provided in Section 5.5.

Section 2.10.  Notes.

         The Revolving Advances made by each Lender shall, in addition to this
Agreement, also be evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrower substantially
in the form of Exhibit I (each a "Revolving Note"), payable to the order of such
Lender in a principal amount equal to the amount of its Commitment as originally
in effect and otherwise duly completed.

Section 2.11.  Increase in Commitments.
         The Borrower shall have the right to request increases in the aggregate
amount of the Commitments by providing notice to the Agent; provided, however,
that after giving effect to any such increases the aggregate amount of the
Commitments shall not exceed $350,000,000. Each such increase in the Commitments
must be an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any
such request. No Lender shall be obligated in any way whatsoever to increase its
Commitment. If a new Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, or if any
existing Lender agrees to increase its Commitment, such Lender shall on the date
it becomes a Lender hereunder (or in the case of an existing Lender, increases
its Commitment) (and as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Lenders its
Commitment Percentage (determined with respect to the Lenders' relative
Commitments and after giving effect to the increase of Commitments) of any
outstanding Loans, by making available to the Agent for the account of such
other Lenders, in same day funds, an amount equal to the sum of (A) the portion
of the outstanding principal amount of such Loans to be purchased by such Lender
plus (B) interest accrued and unpaid to and as of such date on such portion of
the outstanding principal amount of such Loans. The Borrower shall pay to the
Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Lenders under Section 5.4. as a result
of the prepayment of any such Loans. No increase of the Commitments may be
effected under this Section (x) unless no Default or Event of Default is in
existence on the effective date of such increase, (y) unless the Borrower can
demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent that, after giving
effect to such increase, the Borrower will be in compliance with Section 10.1.
and (z) if any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower,
any other Loan Party or the Parent, in any Loan Document to which such Person is
a party is not (or would not be) materially true or correct on the effective
date of such increase except to the extent that such representations and
warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such
representations and warranties shall have been true and accurate on and as of
such earlier date) and except for changes in factual circumstances specifically
and expressly permitted hereunder. In connection with any increase in the
aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section (a) any Lender
becoming a party hereto shall execute such documents and agreements as the Agent
may reasonably request, (b) the Agent shall make appropriate arrangements so
that the Borrower executes and delivers (which the Borrower agrees to do) a new
or replacement Note, as appropriate, in favor of each new Lender, and any
existing Lender increasing its Commitment, in the amount of such Lender's
Commitment at the time of the effectiveness of the applicable increase in the
aggregate amount of Commitments and (c) the Borrower shall, and shall cause each
Subsidiary that owns any Collateral Property, to execute such documents,
instruments and agreements as the Agent may reasonably deem necessary or
appropriate to preserve, protect, or maintain the priority of, any Lien
purported to be granted under any of the Collateral Documents.

Section 2.12.  Voluntary Reductions of the Commitment.

         The Borrower may terminate or reduce the unused amount of the
Commitments (for which purpose use of the Commitments shall be deemed to include
the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities and Swingline Loans) at any
time and from time to time without penalty or premium upon not less than 5
Business Days prior notice to the Agent of each such reduction or termination,
which notice shall specify the effective date thereof and, in the case of a
reduction, the amount of such reduction (which shall not be less than $5,000,000
and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount in the aggregate)
and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Agent. Promptly after receipt of
any such notice the Agent shall notify each Lender of the proposed termination
or Commitment reduction. The Commitments, once reduced or terminated pursuant to
this Section, may not be increased or reinstated. The Borrower shall pay all
interest and fees, on the Advances accrued to the date of such reduction or
termination of the Commitments to the Agent for the account of the Lenders,
including but not limited to any applicable compensation due to each Lender in
accordance with Section 5.4. of this Agreement.

Section 2.13.  Extension of Termination Date.

         The Borrower may request that the Agent and the Lenders extend the
current Termination Date by one year by executing and delivering to the Agent at
least 90 days but not more than 180 days prior to the current Termination Date,
a written request for such extension. The Agent shall forward to each Lender a
copy of such request delivered to the Agent promptly upon receipt thereof.
Subject to satisfaction of the following conditions, the Termination Date shall
be extended for one year: (a) immediately prior to such extension and
immediately after giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall or
would exist and (b) the Borrower shall have paid the Fees payable under Section
3.5.(d). The Termination Date may be extended only one time pursuant to this
subsection.

Section 2.14. Expiration or Maturity Date of Letters of Credit Past Termination
Date.

         If on the date the Commitments are terminated (whether voluntarily, by
reason of the occurrence of an Event of Default or otherwise), there are any
Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder, the Borrower shall, on such date,
either (a) pay to the Agent an amount of money equal to the Stated Amount of
such Letter(s) of Credit to be held by the Agent in an interest bearing account
as cash collateral for the Letter of Credit Liabilities relating to such
Letter(s) of Credit or (b) deliver to the Agent one or more letters of credit,
each to be in form and substance, and issued by financial institutions,
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, having an aggregate stated amount at least
equal to the Stated Amount of all such Letters of Credit less any amounts paid
to the Agent to be held as cash collateral under the immediately preceding
clause (a). If a drawing pursuant to any such Letter of Credit occurs on or
prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Borrower authorizes
the Agent to use the monies paid to the Agent as cash collateral to make payment
to the beneficiary with respect to such drawing or the payee with respect to
such presentment. If no drawing occurs on or prior to the expiration date of
such Letter of Credit, the Agent shall pay to the Borrower (or to whomever else
may be legally entitled thereto) the monies paid to the Agent to be held as cash
collateral with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit, together with all
interest accrued thereon, on or before the date 5 days after the expiration date
of such Letter of Credit.

Section 2.15.  Amount Limitations.

         Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, no Lender shall be required to make any Advance, and the Agent shall
not be required to issue a Letter of Credit, if immediately after the making of
such Advance or issuance of such Letter of Credit the aggregate principal amount
of all outstanding Advances together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of
Credit Liabilities would exceed either (a) the aggregate amount of the
Commitments or (b) the Borrowing Base.

            ARTICLE III. PAYMENTS, FEES AND OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 3.1.  Payments.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, in
immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, to the
Agent at the Principal Office, not later than 11:00 a.m. San Francisco time on
the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made after
such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
Business Day). Subject to Section 11.7., the Borrower shall, at the time of
making each payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, specify to
the Agent the amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is
to be applied. Each payment received by the Agent for the account of a Lender
under this Agreement or any Note shall be paid to such Lender by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions
provided by such Lender to the Agent from time to time, for the account of such
Lender at the applicable Lending Office of such Lender. In the event the Agent
fails to pay such amounts to such Lender within one Business Day of receipt of
such amounts, the Agent shall pay interest on such amount at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If the due date of
any payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall
on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and interest shall continue to accrue at the rate, if
any, applicable to such payment for the period of such extension.

Section 3.2.  Pro Rata Treatment.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing from
Lenders under Section 2.1. shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of the
fees under Sections 3.5.(a), (b) and (d) and the first sentence of Section
3.5.(c) shall be made for the account of the Lenders, and each termination or
reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.12. shall be applied
to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts
of their respective Commitments; (b) each payment or prepayment of principal of
Revolving Advances by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders
pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the
Revolving Advances held by them, provided that if immediately prior to giving
effect to any such payment in respect of any Revolving Advances the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Advances shall not be held by the Lenders pro
rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such
Advances were made, then such payment shall be applied to the Revolving Advances
in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Advances being held by the Lenders pro rata in
accordance with their respective Commitments; (c) each payment of interest on
Revolving Advances by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders
pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Advances then due
and payable to the respective Lenders; and (d) the Conversion and Continuation
of Revolving Advances of a particular Type (other than Conversions provided for
by Section 5.5.) shall be made pro rata among the Lenders according to the
amounts of their respective Revolving Advances and the then current Interest
Period for each Lender's portion of each Revolving Advance of such Type shall be
coterminous; and (e) the Lenders' participation in, and payment obligations in
respect of, Swingline Loans under Section 2.3., shall be in accordance with
their respective Commitment Percentages; and (f) the Lenders' participation in,
and payment obligations in respect of, Letters of Credit under Section 2.2.,
shall be pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages.
All payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts in respect of the
Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender only (except to
the extent any Lender shall have acquired a participating interest in any such
Swingline Loan pursuant to Section 2.3.(e)).

Section 3.3.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.

         If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on,
any Advance under this Agreement or shall obtain payment on any other Obligation
owing by the Borrower or any other Loan Party through the exercise of any right
of banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise or through
voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender or other payments made by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Lender not in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and such payment should be distributed to the Lenders in
accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 11.7., such Lender shall promptly
purchase from such other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent
specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Advances made by the other
Lenders or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts, and
make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end
that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any
reasonable expenses which may actually be incurred by such Lender in obtaining
or preserving such benefit) in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2.
or Section 11.7., as applicable. To such end, all the Lenders shall make
appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold
or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The
Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct
interest) in the Advances or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders may,
subject to the limitations of Section 13.3., exercise all rights of set-off,
banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with the respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Advances in the
amount of such participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender
to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise
and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other
indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.

Section 3.4.  Several Obligations.

         No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
make an Advance or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by
such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make an Advance or
to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall
not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Advance or to perform
any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.

Section 3.5.  Fees.

         (a) Closing Fees. On the Effective Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to
the Agent and each Lender all loan fees as have been agreed to in writing by the
Borrower and the Agent or each Lender, as applicable.

         (b) Annual Unused Fee. During the period from the Effective Date to but
excluding the Termination Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of the Lenders an unused facility fee equal to the sum of the average
daily amount by which the aggregate amount of the Commitments (as they may be
reduced from time to time pursuant to Section 2.12. or increased from time to
time in accordance with this Agreement) exceeds the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of Revolving Advances and Letter of Credit Liabilities set
forth in the table below multiplied by the corresponding per annum rate
applicable to the entire excess:

--------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
  Amount by Which Commitments Exceeds Revolving Advances and         Unused Fee
                 Letter of Credit Liabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
$0 to and including an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate             .125%
amount of Commitments
--------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
--------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
Greater than an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate amount             .250%
of Commitments
--------------------------------------------------------------- --------------

Such fee shall be computed on a daily basis for each calendar quarter during the
term of this Agreement. Such fee shall be payable in arrears on the first day of
each December, March, June or September, as applicable, immediately following
each such calendar quarter. Any such accrued and unpaid fee shall also be
payable on the Termination Date or any earlier date of termination of the
Commitments or reduction of the Commitments to zero.

         (c) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for
the account of each Lender a letter of credit fee at a rate per annum equal to
one percent (1.0%) of the daily average Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit
for the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit
(x) to and including the date such Letter of Credit expires or is terminated or
(y) to but excluding the date such Letter of Credit is drawn in full; provided,
however, in no event shall the aggregate amount of such fee in respect of any
Letter of Credit be less than $1,000. Such fee shall be nonrefundable and
payable in arrears (i) quarterly on the first day of January, April, July and
October, (ii) on the Termination Date, (iii) on the date the Commitments are
terminated or reduced to zero and (iv) thereafter from time to time on demand of
the Agent. The Borrower shall pay directly to the Agent from time to time on
demand all commissions, charges, costs and expenses in the amounts customarily
charged by the Agent from time to time in like circumstances with respect to the
issuance of each Letter of Credit, drawings, amendments and other transactions
relating thereto.

         (d) Extension Fee. If, pursuant to Section 2.13., the Borrower
exercises its right to extend the Termination Date, the Borrower agrees to pay
to the Agent for the account of each Lender an extension fee equal to 0.15% of
the amount of such Lender's Commitment at such time. Such fee shall be paid to
the Agent prior to, and as a condition to, such extension.

         (e) Administrative and Other Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the
administrative and other fees of the Agent as may be agreed to in writing from
time to time.

Section 3.6.  Computations.

         Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on
any Advance, any Fees or other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed; provided,
however, fees in respect of Letters of Credit shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days
elapsed.

Section 3.7.  Usury.

         In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Advances
or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable
Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or received by any Lender,
then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the
Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower elects
to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith. It is the express intent of
the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive,
directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that
which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law. The parties
hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower
for the use of money in connection with this Agreement is and shall be the
interest specifically described in Section 2.4.(a)(i) and (ii) and with respect
to Swingline Loans, in Section 2.3.(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication
fees, facility fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees, default charges,
late charges, funding or "breakage" charges, increased cost charges, attorneys'
fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Agent or any Lender to
third parties or for damages incurred by the Agent or any Lender, are charges
made to compensate the Agent or any such Lender for underwriting or
administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be
performed or incurred, by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with this
Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use
of money. All charges other than charges for the use of money shall be fully
earned and nonrefundable when due.

Section 3.8.  Defaulting Lenders.

         If for any reason any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") shall fail or
refuse to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document to which it is a party within the time period specified for performance
of such obligation or, if no time period is specified, if such failure or
refusal continues for a period of 5 Business Days after notice from the Agent,
then, in addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to the Agent
or the Borrower under this Agreement or Applicable Law, such Defaulting Lender's
right to participate in the administration of the Advances, this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, including without limitation, any right to vote in
respect of, to consent to or to direct any action or inaction of the Agent or to
be taken into account in the calculation of Requisite Lenders, shall be
suspended during the pendency of such failure or refusal. If for any reason a
Lender fails to make timely payment to the Agent of any amount required to be
paid to the Agent hereunder (without giving effect to any notice or cure
periods), in addition to other rights and remedies which the Agent or the
Borrower may have under the immediately preceding provisions or otherwise, the
Agent shall be entitled (i) to collect interest from such Defaulting Lender on
such delinquent payment for the period from the date on which the payment was
due until the date on which the payment is made at the Federal Funds Rate, (ii)
to withhold or setoff and to apply in satisfaction of the defaulted payment and
any related interest, any amounts otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (iii) to bring an action or
suit against such Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to
recover the defaulted amount and any related interest. The Agent shall give the
Borrower prompt notice of the failure of any Lender to make available to the
Agent the proceeds of any Advance required to be made available by such Lender.
Any amounts received by the Agent in respect of a Defaulting Lender's Advances
shall not be paid to such Defaulting Lender and shall be held by the Agent and
paid to such Defaulting Lender upon the Defaulting Lender's curing of its
default.

Section 3.9.  Taxes.

         (a) Taxes Generally. All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and
interest on, the Advances and all other Obligations shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any present or future excise, stamp or other taxes,
fees, duties, levies, imposts, charges, deductions, withholdings or other
charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding
(i) franchise taxes, (ii) any taxes (other than withholding taxes) that would
not be imposed but for a connection between the Agent or a Lender and the
jurisdiction imposing such taxes (other than a connection arising solely by
virtue of the activities of the Agent or such Lender pursuant to or in respect
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document), (iii) any taxes imposed on or
measured by any Lender's assets, net income, receipts or branch profits and (iv)
any taxes arising after the Agreement Date solely as a result of or attributable
to a Lender changing its designated Lending Office after the date such Lender
becomes a party hereto (such non-excluded items being collectively called
"Taxes"). If any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the
Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any
Applicable Law, then the Borrower will:

                  (i) pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority the
         full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;

                  (ii) promptly forward to the Agent an official receipt or
         other documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment
         to such Governmental Authority; and

                  (iii) pay to the Agent for its account or the account of the
         applicable Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or
         amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received
         by the Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that the Agent
         or such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction
         been required.

         (b) Tax Indemnification. If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when
due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the Agent,
for its account or the account of the respective Lender, as the case may be, the
required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall
indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any
such failure. For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the
Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a
payment by the Borrower.

         (c) Tax Forms. Prior to the date that any Lender or Participant
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America
becomes a party hereto, such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent
such certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Internal
Revenue Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including Internal
Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor
forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender
or Participant establishing that payments to it hereunder and under the Notes
are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax and (ii) not
subject to United States Federal withholding tax under the Code. Each such
Lender or Participant shall (x) deliver further copies of such forms or other
appropriate certifications on or before the date that any such forms expire or
become obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent form delivered to the Borrower and (y) obtain such extensions of the
time for filing, and renew such forms and certifications thereof, as may be
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent. The Borrower shall not be
required to pay any amount pursuant to last sentence of subsection (a) above to
any Lender or Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside of the United States of America or the Agent, if it is organized under
the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America, if such
Lender, Participant or the Agent, as applicable, fails to comply with the
requirements of this subsection. If any such Lender or Participant fails to
deliver the above forms or other documentation, then the Agent may withhold from
such payment to such Lender such amounts as are required by the Code. If any
Governmental Authority asserts that the Agent did not properly withhold or
backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made
to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Agent
therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent under this Section, and costs
and expenses (including all fees and disbursements of any law firm or other
external counsel and the allocated cost of internal legal services and all
disbursements of internal counsel) of the Agent. The obligation of the Lenders
under this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments, repayment
of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

                        ARTICLE IV. COLLATERAL PROPERTIES

Section 4.1.  Eligibility of Properties.

         (a) Initial Collateral Properties. As of the date hereof, the Lenders
have approved for inclusion in calculations of the Borrowing Base, the
Properties identified on Schedule 4.1. Upon satisfaction on or after the
Effective Date of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3. with respect to such
Properties, such Properties shall be deemed to be Collateral Properties.

         (b) Additional Collateral Properties. If after the Effective Date the
Borrower desires that the Lenders include any additional Property as a
Collateral Property in calculations of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall so
notify the Agent in writing. No Property will be evaluated by the Lenders unless
and until the Borrower delivers to the Agent the following, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent:

                  (i) An executive summary of the Property including, at a
         minimum, the following information relating to such Property: (A) a
         description of such Property, such description to include the age,
         location, site plan and current occupancy rate of such Property; (B) if
         such Property is being acquired, the purchase price paid or to be paid
         for such Property; and (C) the current projected capital plans and, if
         applicable, current renovation plans for such Property;

                  (ii) Historical operating statements for such Property to the
         extent reasonably available to the Borrower, and such projections and
         other information concerning the anticipated operation of such Property
         as the Agent may reasonably request; and

                  (iii) A current rent roll for such Property, and a three-year
         occupancy history of such Property to the extent reasonably available
         to the Borrower.

Upon receipt of the foregoing documents and information, the Agent shall
promptly forward a copy thereof to each Lender. Within 10 Business Days from the
date on which a Lender receives all such documents and information from the
Agent, such Lender shall notify the Agent whether or not such Lender
conditionally approves of such Property as a Collateral Property subject only to
such Lender's approval of the applicable Appraisal and other items as provided
in the immediately following subsection. If a Lender fails to give such notice
prior to the expiration of such 10-day period, such Lender shall be deemed to
have conditionally approved such Property as a Collateral Property. If the
Requisite Lenders (which for purposes of this subsection (b) must include the
Lender then acting as Agent) have not conditionally approved such Property as an
Collateral Property, the approval process shall terminate.

         (c) Appraisal; Final Approval. Upon the earlier of (i) written request
by the Borrower or (ii) the Requisite Lenders' conditional approval of a
Property as a Collateral Property pursuant to the immediately preceding
subsection (b), the Agent shall commission, at the Borrower's expense, an
Appraisal of such Property, to be in form and substance satisfactory to the
Agent. Within 7 Business Days of receipt of such Appraisal, the Agent shall
review such Appraisal and shall determine the Appraised Value of such Property.
If after such review and determination the Agent is unwilling to recommend
acceptance of such Property as a Collateral Property, the Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Lenders and the consideration by the Agent and the
Lenders of such Property shall cease. If after such review and determination the
Agent remains prepared to recommend acceptance of such Property as a Collateral
Property, the Agent shall promptly forward a copy of such Appraisal to the
Lenders together with notice of such Appraised Value. Each Lender which
previously conditionally approved such Property as a Collateral Property shall
notify the Agent in writing whether or not such Lender accepts such Appraisal
and Appraised Value within 7 Business Days from the date of receipt by such
Lender of such Appraisal and Appraised Value. If a Lender fails to give such
notice prior to the expiration of such 7-Business Day period, such Lender shall
be deemed to have accepted and approved such Appraisal and Appraised Value. Such
Property shall become a Collateral Property upon approval of the Requisite
Lenders (which for purposes of this subsection (c) must include the Lender then
acting as Agent) and upon execution and delivery to the Agent of the documents
and items described in Section 6.3., and such other items or documents as may be
appropriate under the circumstances, and satisfaction of all other closing
requirements reasonably imposed by the Agent.

Section 4.2.  Release of Properties.

         The Borrower may request, upon not less than 10 Business Days prior
notice to the Agent, that any Collateral Property, or portion thereof, be
released from the Liens created by the Collateral Documents applicable thereto,
which release (the "Property Release") shall be effected by the Agent if the
Agent determines all of the following conditions are satisfied as of the date of
such Property Release:

         (a) subject to the terms of Section 11.4., no Default or Event of
Default exists or will exist immediately after giving effect to such Property
Release and the reduction in the Borrowing Base by reason of the release of such
Property;

         (b) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Agent a Borrowing Base
Certificate and the Agent shall have determined to its satisfaction (which
determination may be based on Appraisals ordered pursuant to Section
4.3.(b)(iii)), that the outstanding principal balance of the Advances, together
with the Letter of Credit Liabilities, will not exceed the Borrowing Base after
giving effect to such request and any prepayment to be made and/or the
acceptance of any Property as an additional or replacement Collateral Property
to be given concurrently with such request;

         (c) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Agent all documents and
instruments reasonably requested by the Agent in connection with such Property
Release including, without limitation, the following:

                  (i) in the case of the release of a portion of a Collateral
Property, a survey of such portion;

                  (ii) the quitclaim deed, release, partial release or other
         instrument to be used to effect such Property Release; and

                  (iii) an appropriate endorsement to the mortgagee title
         insurance policy in effect with respect to the affected Collateral
         Property;

         (d) after giving effect to such Property Release, each of Post Oak
Mall, Georgia Square Mall, Madison Square Mall, and Richland Mall (or any
regional mall which is a Collateral Property and is determined by the Requisite
Lenders to be of equivalent financial strength to any of the foregoing malls),
will remain as a Collateral Property in the Borrowing Base; provided, however,
if at the time of such Property Release, the Collateral Properties consist only
of the malls referred to above, then the provisions of this clause (d) shall not
apply; and

         (e) the Agent shall have reasonably determined that the market values
of the remaining Collateral Properties have not materially deteriorated since
the respective dates of acceptance as Collateral Properties.

In connection with any Property Release of an entire Collateral Property owned
by a Subsidiary, the Agent shall release such Subsidiary from the Guaranty to
which it is a party so long as no Default or Event of Default shall then be in
existence or would occur as a result of such release. Except as set forth in
this Section 4.2., no Collateral Property shall be released from the Liens
created by the Collateral Documents applicable thereto.

Section 4.3.  Frequency of Appraisals.

         The Appraised Value of a Collateral Property shall be determined or
redetermined, as applicable, under each of the following circumstances:

         (a) In connection with the acceptance of a Property as a Collateral
Property, the Agent will determine the Appraised Value thereof as provided in
Section 4.1.; or

         (b) From time to time upon at least 5 Business Days notice to the
Borrower and at the Borrower's expense (except as provided below), the Agent may
(and shall at the direction of the Requisite Lenders) redetermine the Appraised
Value of a Collateral Property (based on a new Appraisal obtained by the Agent)
in any of the following circumstances:

                  (i) if a material adverse change occurs with respect to such
         Collateral Property, including, without limitation, a material
         deterioration in the Net Operating Income of such Property, a major
         casualty at such Property that is not fully covered by insurance, a
         material condemnation of any part of such Property or a material
         decrease in the leasing level of such Property; or

                  (ii) at the Lenders' expense, if necessary in order to comply
         with FIRREA or other Applicable Law relating to the Agent or the
         Lenders; or

                  (iii) at the Lenders' expense, if the Agent determines an
         Appraisal of such Property is necessary in connection with its
         determination under Section 4.2.(b) regarding the release of a
         Collateral Property; or

         (c) At any time and from time to time but no more than once prior to
the initial Termination Date, the Agent may (and shall at the written direction
of the Requisite Lenders) redetermine the Appraised Value of each Collateral
Property (based on a new Appraisal obtained by the Agent), all at the Borrower's
expense; or

         (d) At any time and from time to time but no more than once during any
one-year period, the Agent may (and shall at the written direction of the
Requisite Lenders) redetermine the Appraised Value of each Collateral Property
(based on a new Appraisal obtained by the Agent), all at the Lenders' expense.

Section 4.4.  Frequency of Calculations of Borrowing Base.

         Initially, the Borrowing Base shall be the amount set forth as such in
the Borrowing Base Certificate delivered under Section 6.1. Thereafter, the
Borrowing Base shall be the amount set forth as such in the Borrowing Base
Certificate most recently delivered under Section 9.4.(b) or 4.2.(b). Subject to
Section 9.4.(b), any increase in the Borrowing Base shall become effective as of
the next determination of the Borrowing Base as provided in this Section,
provided that prior to such date of determination (a) if such increase is the
result of an increase in (i) the Appraised Value of a Collateral Property, the
Requisite Lenders shall have given their written approval of such increase or
(ii) the Permanent Loan Estimate of a Collateral Property, the applicable
Borrowing Base Certificate substantiates such increase and (b) the Borrower
delivers to the Agent the following: (i) if such increase is the result of an
increase in the Appraised Value of any Collateral Property that is not located
in a Tie-In Jurisdiction, an endorsement to the title insurance policy in favor
of the Agent with respect to each such Collateral Property increasing the
coverage amount thereof as related to such Collateral Property to not less than
100% of the Appraised Value for such Collateral Property and (ii) if any such
Collateral Property is located in a Tie-In Jurisdiction, an endorsement to the
title insurance policy in favor of the Agent with respect to each such
Collateral Property increasing the coverage amount thereof as related to such
Collateral Property to not less than the portion of the Borrowing Base
attributable to such Collateral Property, as well as endorsements to all other
existing title insurance policies issued to the Agent with respect to all other
Collateral Properties located in Tie-In Jurisdictions reflecting an increase in
the aggregate insured amount under the "tie-in" endorsements to an amount equal
to the Borrowing Base (including each Collateral Property to which the increase
in the Borrowing Base is attributable) but in no event in an amount in excess of
the aggregate amount of the Commitments.

                        ARTICLE V. YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.

Section 5.1.  Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy.

         (a) Additional Costs. The Borrower shall promptly pay to the Agent for
the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may
reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs
incurred by such Lender that it reasonably determines are attributable to its
making or maintaining of any LIBOR Advances or its obligation to make any LIBOR
Advances hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such
LIBOR Advances or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital
in respect of its LIBOR Advances or its Commitment (such increases in costs and
reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"),
resulting from any Regulatory Change that: (i) changes the basis of taxation of
any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents in respect of any of such LIBOR Advances or its Commitment (other than
taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net income of such Lender or of its
Lending Office for any of such LIBOR Advances by the jurisdiction in which such
Lender has its principal office or such Lending Office), or (ii) imposes or
modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (including without
limitation, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
or other similar reserve requirement applicable to any other category of
liabilities or category of extensions of credit or other assets by reference to
which the interest rate on LIBOR Advances is determined) relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other
liabilities of, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds
by such Lender (or its parent corporation), or any commitment of such Lender
(including, without limitation, the Commitment of such Lender hereunder) or
(iii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of
such Lender to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for
such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with
respect to capital adequacy).

         (b) Lender's Suspension of LIBOR Advances. Without limiting the effect
of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsection (a), if by reason of
any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or
measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of
deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference
to which the interest rate on LIBOR Advances is determined as provided in this
Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender
that includes LIBOR Advances or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the
amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if
such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), the
obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Advances
into, LIBOR Advances hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provision of Section 5.5. shall
apply).

         (c) Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. Without limiting
the obligations of the Borrower under the preceding subsections of this Section
(but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change or any
risk-based capital guideline or other requirement heretofore or hereafter issued
by any Governmental Authority there shall be imposed, modified or deemed
applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar
requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of
Credit and the result shall be to increase the cost to the Agent of issuing (or
any Lender of purchasing participations in) or maintaining its obligation
hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of Credit or
reduce any amount receivable by the Agent or any Lender hereunder in respect of
any Letter of Credit, then, upon demand by the Agent or such Lender, the
Borrower shall pay immediately to the Agent for its account or the account of
such Lender, as applicable, from time to time as specified by the Agent or a
Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Agent
or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.

         (d) Notification and Determination of Additional Costs. Each of the
Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower of any
event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Agent or such Lender to
compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly
as practicable; provided, however, that if the Agent or a Lender shall fail to
give such notice within 45 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such event,
then the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall only be entitled to
compensation under any of the preceding subsections for compensable amounts
attributable to such event arising following the date the Agent or such Lender,
as the case may be, obtains actual knowledge of such event. The Agent and each
Lender, as the case may be, agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case
of a Lender to the Agent as well) a certificate setting forth the basis and
amount of each request for compensation under this Section. Determinations by
the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of the effect of any Regulatory
Change shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a
reasonable basis and in good faith.

Section 5.2.  Suspension of LIBOR Advances.

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the
determination of LIBOR for any Interest Period:

                  (a) the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall
         be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant
         deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR are not being provided
         in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
         determining rates of interest for LIBOR Advances as provided herein or
         is otherwise unable to determine LIBOR, or

                  (b) the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall
         be conclusive) that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the
         definition of LIBOR upon the basis of which the rate of interest for
         LIBOR Advances for such Interest Period is to be determined are not
         likely to adequately cover the cost to any Lender of making or
         maintaining LIBOR Advances for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof
and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no
obligation to, and shall not, make additional LIBOR Advances, Continue LIBOR
Advances or Convert Advances into LIBOR Advances and the Borrower shall, on the
last day of each current Interest Period for each outstanding LIBOR Advance,
either prepay such Advance or Convert such Advance into a Base Rate Advance.

Section 5.3.  Illegality.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender
shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding) that it is
unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR
Advances hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof
(with a copy of such notice to the Agent) and such Lender's obligation to make
or Continue, or to Convert Revolving Advances of any other Type into, LIBOR
Advances shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and
maintain LIBOR Advances (in which case the provisions of Section 5.5. shall be
applicable).

Section 5.4.  Compensation.

         The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for account of each Lender, upon
the request of such Lender through the Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be
sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss, cost or expense that such
Lender reasonably determines is attributable to:

                  (a) any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional)
         of a LIBOR Advance or Conversion of a LIBOR Advance, made by such
         Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on
         a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance;
         or

                  (b) any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including,
         without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions
         precedent specified in Article 6.2. to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR
         Advance from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert
         a Base Rate Advance into a LIBOR Advance or Continue a LIBOR Advance on
         the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.

Not in limitation of the foregoing, such compensation shall include, without
limitation; in the case of a LIBOR Advance, an amount equal to the then present
value of (A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on such LIBOR
Advance for the remainder of the Interest Period at the rate applicable to such
LIBOR Advance, less (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same
LIBOR Advance for the same period if LIBOR were set on the date on which such
LIBOR Advance was repaid, prepaid or Converted or the date on which the Borrower
failed to borrow, Convert or Continue such LIBOR Advance, as applicable,
calculating present value by using as a discount rate LIBOR quoted on such date.
Upon Borrower's request (made through the Agent), any Lender seeking
compensation under this Section shall provide the Borrower with a statement
setting forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for
determining the amount thereof. Any such statement shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

Section 5.5.  Treatment of Affected Advances.

         If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Advances or to Continue,
or to Convert Base Rate Advances into, LIBOR Advances shall be suspended
pursuant to Section 5.2. or Section 5.3. then such Lender's LIBOR Advances shall
be automatically Converted into Base Rate Advances on the last day(s) of the
then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Advances (or, in the case of a
Conversion required by Section 5.2. on such earlier date as such Lender may
specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such
Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 5.1., Section 5.2. or 5.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer
exist:

                  (a) to the extent that such Lender's LIBOR Advances have been
         so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would
         otherwise be applied to such Lender's LIBOR Advances shall be applied
         instead to its Base Rate Advances; and

                  (b) all Revolving Advances that would otherwise be made or
         Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Advances shall be made or Continued
         instead as Base Rate Advances, and all Base Rate Advances of such
         Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Advances shall
         remain as Base Rate Advances.

          If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent)
that the circumstances specified in Section 5.1. or 5.3. that gave rise to the
Conversion of such Lender's LIBOR Advances pursuant to this Section no longer
exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing
to exist) at a time when LIBOR Advances made by other Lenders are outstanding,
then such Lender's Base Rate Advances shall be automatically Converted, on the
first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
LIBOR Advances, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Advances held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Advances and by such Lender are
held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

Section 5.6.  Affected Lenders.

         If (a) a Lender (other than the Lender then acting as the Agent)
requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.9. or 5.1., and the Requisite
Lenders are not also doing the same, or (b) the obligation of any Lender (other
than the Lender then acting as the Agent) to make LIBOR Advances that are
Revolving Advances or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Advances into, LIBOR
Advances that are Revolving Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section
5.1.(b) or 5.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been
suspended under such Sections, then, so long as there does not then exist any
Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may demand that such Lender (the
"Affected Lender"), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly,
assign its Commitments to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with
the provisions of Section 13.5.(c) for a purchase price equal to the aggregate
principal balance of Advances then owing to the Affected Lender plus any accrued
but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected
Lender. Each of the Agent and the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in
effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section, but at
no time shall the Agent, such Affected Lender nor any other Lender be obligated
in any way whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding
an Eligible Assignee. The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this
Section shall be at the Borrower's sole cost and expenses and at no cost or
expense to the Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders; provided,
however, the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse or otherwise pay an
Affected Lender's administrative or legal costs incurred as a result of the
Borrower's exercise of its rights under this Section. The terms of this Section
shall not in any way limit the Borrower's obligation to pay to any Affected
Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 3.9. or
5.1. with respect to any matters or events existing on or prior to the date an
Affected Lender ceases to be a party to this Agreement.

Section 5.7.  Change of Lending Office.

         Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate an
alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Advances affected by the
matters or circumstances described in Sections 3.9., 5.1. or 5.3. to reduce the
liability of the Borrower or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as
such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such
Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation
to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America.

Section 5.8.  Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Advances.

         Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article V.
shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Advances through
the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate
applicable to such LIBOR Advances in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR
Advances and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period;
provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Advances in any
manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for
calculation of amounts payable under this Article V.

         enjoin, impose materially burdensome conditions on, or otherwise
         materially and adversely affect the ability of the Borrower, or any

Section 6.2.  Conditions Precedent to All Advances and Letters of Credit.

         The obligations of (i) Lenders to make any Advances and (ii) the Agent
to issue Letters of Credit, are each subject to the further conditions precedent
that:

         (a) in the case of the making of an Advance, (x) no Default under
subsections (a), (b)(i), (e) or (f) of Section 11.1., (y) no other Default as to
which the Agent has given the Borrower notice and (z) no Event of Default, shall
exist as of the date of the making of such Advance or would exist immediately
after giving effect thereto;

         (b) in the case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no Default or
Event of Default shall exist as of the date of the issuance of such Letter of
Credit or would exist immediately after giving effect thereto

         (c) none of the conditions described in Section 2.15. would exist after
giving effect to the making of such Advance or Swingline Loan or the issuance of
such Letter of Credit;

         (d) the representations and warranties made or deemed made by the
Parent, the Borrower and each other Loan Party in the Loan Documents to which
any of them is a party, shall be true and correct on and as of the date of the
making of such Advance or date of issuance of such Letter of Credit with the
same force and effect as if made on and as of such date except to the extent
that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier
date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and
accurate on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual
circumstances specifically and expressly permitted hereunder; and

         (e) in the case of the borrowing of Revolving Advances, the Agent shall
have received a timely Notice of Borrowing, or in the case of a Swingline Loan,
the Swingline Lender shall have received a timely Notice of Swingline Borrowing.

The occurrence of each Credit Event shall constitute a certification by the
Borrower to the effect set forth in the immediately preceding subsections (a)
through (d) (both as of the date of the giving of notice relating to such Credit
Event and, unless the Borrower otherwise notifies the Agent prior to the date of
such Credit Event, as of the date of the occurrence of such Credit Event). In
addition, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented to the Agent and the
Lenders at the time such Advance or Swingline Loan is made or such Letter of
Credit is issued that to the best of the Borrower's knowledge all conditions to
the making of such Advance or Swingline Loan or issuing of such Letter of Credit
contained in this Article VI. have been satisfied.

Section 6.3. Conditions Precedent to a Property Becoming a Collateral Property.

         No Property shall become a Collateral Property until the Borrower shall
have (or shall have caused to be) executed and delivered to the Agent all
documents and instruments required under Section 4.1., the Requisite Lenders

Section 7.1.  Representations and Warranties.

         In order to induce the Agent and each Lender to enter into this
Agreement and to make Advances and, in the case of the Agent, to issue Letters
of Credit, and, in the case of the Lenders, to acquire participations in Letters
of Credit and Swingline Loans, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Agent
and each Lender as follows:

         (a) Organization; Power; Qualification. Each of the Parent and the Loan
Parties is a corporation, partnership or other legal entity, duly organized or
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation, has the power and authority to own or lease its
respective properties and to carry on its respective business as now being and
hereafter proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified and is in good standing
as a domestic or foreign corporation, partnership or other legal entity, and
authorized to do business, in each jurisdiction in which the character of its
properties or the nature of its business requires such qualification or
authorization and where the failure to be so qualified or authorized could
reasonably be expected to have, in each instance, a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Ownership of Loan Parties. Schedule 7.1.(b) is, as of the Agreement
Date, a complete and correct list of each Loan Party and each Subsidiary of the
Parent, directly or indirectly, holding an Equity Interest in any Loan Party,
setting forth for each such Person, (i) the jurisdiction of organization of such
Person, (ii) each Person holding any Equity Interest in such Person, (iii) the
nature of the Equity Interests held by each such Person and (iv) the percentage
of ownership of such Person represented by such Equity Interests. Except as
disclosed in such Schedule (A) each of the Parent, the Borrower and its
applicable Subsidiaries owns, free and clear of all Liens, and has the
unencumbered right to vote, all outstanding Equity Interests in each Person
shown to be held by it on such Schedule, (B) all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of each such Person organized as a corporation is validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and (C) there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, commitments, preemptive rights or agreements of any kind
(including, without limitation, any stockholders' or voting trust agreements)
for the issuance, sale, registration or voting of, or outstanding securities
convertible into, any additional shares of capital stock of any class, or
partnership or other ownership interests of any type in, any such Person.
Exhibit 21 to the Parent's Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001
is an accurate list of the Subsidiaries of the Parent as of such date (excluding
those Subsidiaries that need not be disclosed on such Exhibit pursuant to
Regulation S-K of the Securities Act).

         (c) Authorization of Agreement, Notes, Loan Documents and Borrowings.
The Borrower has the right and power, and has taken all necessary action to
authorize it, to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. The Borrower, each other
Loan Party and the Parent has the right and power, and has taken all necessary
action to authorize it, to execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party in accordance with their respective terms and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Loan
Documents to which the Borrower, any other Loan Party or the Parent is a party
have been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officers of such
Person and each is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person
enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective terms, except
as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, and other similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies for the enforcement of certain obligations contained herein or therein
may be limited by equitable principles generally.

         (d) Compliance of Agreement, Etc. with Laws. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which any Loan
Party or the Parent is a party in accordance with their respective terms and the
borrowings and other extensions of credit hereunder do not and will not, by the
passage of time, the giving of notice, or both: (i) require any Governmental
Approval or violate any Applicable Law (including all Environmental Laws)
relating to any Loan Party or the Parent;(ii) conflict with, result in a breach
of or constitute a default under the organizational documents of the Borrower,
any other Loan Party or the Parent, or any indenture, agreement or other
instrument to which any Loan Party or the Parent is a party or by which it or
any of its respective properties may be bound; or (iii) result in or require the
creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property now
owned or hereafter acquired by any Loan Party or the Parent other than in favor
of the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders.

         (e) Compliance with Law; Governmental Approvals. To the best of the
knowledge of the Parent and the Borrower after due inquiry, the Parent, each
Loan Party and each other Subsidiary is in compliance with each Governmental
Approval and all other Applicable Laws relating to it except for noncompliances
which, and Governmental Approvals the failure to possess which, could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to cause a Default or
Event of Default or have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (f) Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.1.(f), there are no
actions, suits or proceedings pending (nor, to the knowledge of any Loan Party
or the Parent, are there any actions, suits or proceedings threatened, nor is
there any basis therefor) against or in any other way relating adversely to or
affecting, or the Parent, any Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or any of their
respective property which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (g) Taxes. All federal, state and other tax returns of the Borrower and
the Parent required by Applicable Law to be filed have been duly filed (other
than any return the filing date of which has been extended in accordance with
Applicable Law), and all federal, state and other taxes, assessments and other
governmental charges or levies upon, the Borrower and the Parent and each of
their respective properties, income, profits and assets which are due and
payable have been paid, except any such nonpayment or non-filing which is at the
time permitted under Section 8.5. As of the Agreement Date, none of the United
States income tax returns of either the Borrower or the Parent is under audit.
All charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and the Parent
in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are in accordance with
GAAP.

         (h) Financial Statements. The Borrower has furnished to each Lender
copies of (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and
December 31, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates,
with the opinion thereon of Arthur Andersen LLP, and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows of the Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the three fiscal quarter period ended on such date. Such
balance sheets and statements (including in each case related schedules and
notes) are complete and correct in all material respects and present fairly, in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved, the
consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of their respective dates and the results of operations and the
cash flow for such periods (subject, as to interim statements, to changes
resulting from normal year-end audit adjustments). Neither the Parent, the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary owning a Collateral Property has on the Agreement
Date any material contingent liabilities, liabilities, liabilities for taxes,
unusual or long-term commitments or unrealized or forward anticipated losses
from any unfavorable commitments, except as referred to or reflected or provided
for in said financial statements.

         (i) No Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 2002, there has
been no material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition, results
of operations, business or prospects of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, or
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in each case, taken as a whole. Each of the
Parent, the Borrower, the other Loan Parties and the other Subsidiaries is
Solvent.

         (j) ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor any other member of the ERISA Group
(excluding the Management Company and ERMC, LP) (i) has ever maintained,
adopted, sponsored in whole or in part, or contributed to any pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, employee stock
ownership, severance pay, vacation, bonus, or other incentive plan, any other
written employee program, arrangement, or agreement, any medical, vision,
dental, or any other health plan, any life insurance plan, nor any other
employee benefit plan or fringe benefit plan, including, but not limited to, an
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) or a "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code); (ii)
has ever withdrawn from a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA; (iii) has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect
to any ongoing, frozen, or terminated single-employer plan; or (iv) has any
employees. Neither the Management Company nor ERMC, LP (x) has ever maintained,
adopted, sponsored in whole or in part, or contributed to any Plan; (y) has ever
withdrawn from a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA; or (z) has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to
any ongoing, frozen, or terminated single-employer plan. For purposes of the
prior sentence the term "Plan" means an employee pension benefit plan (including
any multiemployer plan) covered by Title IV of ERISA or subject to the minimum
funding standards under Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code and either (A)

any member of the ERISA Group or (B) at any time within the preceding five years

member of the ERISA Group for employees of any Person which was at such time a
member of the ERISA Group.

         (k) Absence of Defaults. None of the Parent, the Loan Parties or the
other Subsidiaries is in default under its articles of incorporation, bylaws,
partnership agreement or other similar organizational documents, and no event
has occurred, which has not been remedied, cured or waived: (i) which
constitutes a Default or an Event of Default; or (ii) which constitutes, or
which with the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, would constitute,
a default or event of default by, the Parent, any Loan Party or any other
Subsidiary under any agreement (other than this Agreement) or judgment, decree
or order to which any such Person is a party or by which any such Person or any
of its respective properties may be bound where such default or event of default
could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (l) Environmental Laws. To the best of the knowledge of the Parent and
the Borrower after due inquiry, each of the Loan Parties and the other
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and has
obtained all Governmental Approvals which are required under Environmental Laws
and is in compliance with all terms and conditions of such Governmental
Approvals, where with respect to each of the foregoing the failure to obtain or
to comply with could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except for any of the following matters that could not be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, to the best of the knowledge of the Parent and
the Borrower after due inquiry, neither the Parent nor any Loan Party is aware
of, nor has it received notice of, any past or present events, conditions,
circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, actions, or plans which, with
respect to any Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, may unreasonably interfere
with or prevent compliance or continued compliance with Environmental Laws, or
may give rise to any common-law or legal liability, based on or related to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport, or handling or the emission, discharge, release or threatened release
into the environment, of any Hazardous Substance; and there is no civil,
criminal, or administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, notice, or
demand letter, notice of violation, investigation, or proceeding pending or
threatened, against any Loan Party or any other Subsidiary relating in any way
to Environmental Laws which, if determined adversely to such Loan Party or such
other Subsidiary, could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (m) Legal Restrictions on Ability to Borrow. Neither the Parent nor any
Loan Party is subject to any Applicable Law which purports to regulate or
restrict its ability to borrow money or obtain other extensions of credit or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its
obligations under any Loan Document to which it is a party.

         (n) Margin Stock. Neither the Parent nor any Loan Party is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or
carrying "margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

         (o) Broker's Fees. No broker's or finder's fee, commission or similar
compensation will be payable with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No other similar fees or commissions will be payable by the Parent or
any Loan Party for any other services rendered to the Parent or any Loan Party
ancillary to the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (p) Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written information,
reports and other papers and data furnished to the Agent or any Lender by, on
behalf of, or at the direction of, the Parent or any Loan Party were, at the
time the same were so furnished, complete and correct in all material respects,
to the extent necessary to give the recipient a true and accurate knowledge of
the subject matter, or, in the case of financial statements, present fairly, in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved, the
financial position of the Persons involved as at the date thereof and the
results of operations for such periods. No fact is known to the Parent or any
Loan Party which has had a Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth
in the financial statements referred to in Section 7.1.(h) or in such
information, reports or other papers or data or otherwise disclosed in writing
to the Agent and the Lenders prior to the Effective Date. No document furnished
or written statement made to the Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation, preparation or execution, or pursuant to, of this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a fact material to
the creditworthiness of any Loan Party or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

         (q) Not Plan Assets; No Prohibited Transactions. None of the assets of
the Parent or any Loan Party constitutes "plan assets" within the meaning of
ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code and the respective regulations promulgated
thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by the
Loan Parties and the Parent, and the borrowing, obtaining of other credit
extensions and repayment of amounts thereunder, do not and will not constitute
"prohibited transactions" under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.

         (r) Collateral. Each Property included in calculations of the Borrowing
Base satisfies all requirements under the Loan Documents for being a Collateral
Property, including those applicable to an Eligible Property.

         (s) Single Asset Entities. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.1.(s),
each Subsidiary that owns a Collateral Property (i) owns no other assets
(including any Equity Interest in any Person) other than such Collateral
Property and other assets incidental to such Subsidiary's ownership of the
Collateral Property and (ii) is engaged only in the business of owning,
operating and developing such one Collateral Property.

Section 7.2.  Survival of Representations and Warranties, Etc.

         All statements contained in any certificate, financial statement or
other instrument delivered by or on behalf of any Loan Party or the Parent to

accurate on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual
circumstances specifically permitted hereunder. All such representations and
warranties shall survive the effectiveness of this Agreement, the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of the Advances and the issuance
of the Letters of Credit but shall terminate upon the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with, but subject to, the provisions of Section 13.10.

         The Parent and the Borrower shall, and shall cause each other Loan
Party and each other Subsidiary to, comply with all Applicable Law, including

claim which is (x) being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
which operate to suspend the collection thereof and for which adequate reserves
have been established on the books of such Person, or (y) bonded or otherwise
insured against to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent.

the Borrower will cause each Subsidiary that owns a Collateral Property to,
permit representatives of the Agent or any Lender (with reasonable prior notice
so long as no Event of Default then exists) to visit and inspect any of their
respective properties, including without limitation, inspections of any
Collateral Property, for the purpose of determining the existence, location,

carry, any margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or to extend credit to others for the

         For so long as this Agreement is in effect, unless the Requisite
Lenders (or, if required pursuant to Section 13.6., all of the Lenders) shall
otherwise consent in the manner set forth in Section 13.6., the Borrower or the
Parent, as the case may be, shall comply with the following covenants:

Section 10.1.  Financial Covenants.

         (a) Minimum Tangible Net Worth. The Parent shall not permit Tangible

or make cash distributions to its shareholders during any fiscal year in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the minimum amount necessary for the Parent to

Subsidiaries, in each case (x) in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount

under the immediately preceding clause (i) and (y) on a pro rata basis, such
that the aggregate amount distributed to the Parent does not exceed the amount

preceding clause (i). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default or Event of
Default specified in Section 11.1.(a) resulting from the Borrower's failure to
pay when due the principal of, or interest on, any of the Advances or any Fees,
Section 11.1.(e) or (f) shall have occurred and be continuing, or if as a result
of the occurrence of any other Event of Default the Obligations have been
accelerated pursuant to Section 11.2.(a), the Parent and the Borrower shall not,
and shall not permit any other Subsidiary to, make any Restricted Payments
whatsoever.

         (f) Permitted Investments. The Parent shall not, and shall not permit
the Borrower or other Subsidiary to, make an Investment in or otherwise own the

         or a Subsidiary is the lessor and a Person not an Affiliate is the
         lessee; (x) Properties under development; (y) land subject to a binding
         contract of sale under which the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries is
         the seller and the buyer is not an Affiliate of Borrower and (z)

         completed or where development has commenced);

                  (ii) developed real estate used primarily for non-retail
         purposes (other than the real estate located at CBL Center, 2030
         Hamilton Place Boulevard, Chattanooga, Tennessee), such that the
         aggregate book value of such real estate exceeds 10% of Gross Asset
         Value;

                  (iii) Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates of the Borrower
         or the Parent, such that the value of such Investments, determined in
         accordance with GAAP, exceeds 20% of Gross Asset Value;

                  (iv) Investments in Persons that are neither Subsidiaries nor
         Unconsolidated Affiliates of the Borrower or the Parent, such that the
         book value of such Investments, determined in accordance with GAAP,
         exceeds 10% of Gross Asset Value; provided, however, this clause (iv)
         shall not apply to Investments in any Person whose Equity Interests are
         publicly traded and in which the Parent or the Borrower is attempting
         to acquire a controlling interest but only to the extent the aggregate
         value of such Investments under this clause (iv), determined on the
         basis of lower of cost or market value, does not exceed 10% of Gross
         Asset Value (the aggregate amount of such excess to be subject to this
         subsection (f)); or

                  (v) Mortgages in favor of the Borrower or any other Loan Party
         (other than (A) Mortgages securing Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or
         any Subsidiary on September 30,2002 and (B) Mortgages on assets owned
         by the Parent, the Borrower or any Subsidiary), such that the aggregate
         book value of Indebtedness secured by such Mortgages exceeds 10% of
         Gross Asset Value.

In addition to the foregoing limitations, the aggregate value of the Investments
subject to the limitations in the preceding clauses (i) through (v) shall not
exceed 35% of Gross Asset Value.

         (g) Value of Borrower Owned by Parent. The Parent shall not permit (i)
more than 5.0% of the book value of its assets to be attributable to assets not
owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or (ii) more than 10.0%
of the gross revenues of the Parent to be attributable to gross revenues of any
Person other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower.

Section 10.2.  Negative Pledge.

create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any Collateral Property or any of
the other Collateral, now owned or hereafter acquired, except for Permitted

Section 10.3.  Restrictions on Intercompany Transfers.

         The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
(other than CMBS Subsidiaries) to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the
ability of any Subsidiary to: (i) pay dividends or make any other distribution
on any of such Subsidiary's Equity Interests owned by the Borrower or any other
Subsidiary; (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or any other
Subsidiary; (iii) make loans or advances to the Borrower or any other
Subsidiary; or (iv) transfer any of its property or assets to the Borrower or
any other Subsidiary. As used in this Section, the term "CMBS Subsidiary" means
any Subsidiary (a) formed for the specific purpose of holding title to assets
which are collateral for any Extension of Credit to such Subsidiary; (b) which
is prohibited from Guarantying Extension of Credit to any other Person pursuant
to (i) any document, instrument or agreement evidencing such Extension of Credit
or (ii) a provision of such Person's organizational documents which provision
was included in such Person's organizational documents as a condition to the
making of such Extension of Credit; and (c) for which none of the Parent, the
Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary (other than another CMBS
Subsidiary) has Guaranteed any Extensions of Credit to such Subsidiary or has
any direct obligation to maintain or preserve such Subsidiary's financial
condition or to cause such Subsidiary to achieve any specified levels of
operating results, except for customary exceptions for fraud, misapplication of
funds, environmental indemnities, and other similar exceptions to recourse
liability.

Section 10.4. Merger, Consolidation, Sales of Assets and Other Arrangements.

         Without the prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders, such

into any transaction of merger or consolidation; (b) liquidate, windup or
dissolve itself (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution); or (c) convey, sell,
lease, sublease, transfer or otherwise dispose of, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, all or any substantial part of its business or assets,
or the capital stock of or other Equity Interests in any of its Subsidiaries,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired; provided, however, that:

                  (i) any Subsidiary may merge with a Loan Party so long as such
         Loan Party is the survivor;

                  (ii) any Subsidiary may sell, transfer or dispose of its
         assets to a Loan Party;

                  (iii) the Borrower or the Parent may merge with another Person
         so long as (x) the Borrower or the Parent, as the case may be, is the
         survivor of such merger and (x) immediately prior to any such merger
         and immediately thereafter and after giving effect thereto, no Event of
         Default is or would be in existence;

                  (iv) any Subsidiary that is not (and is not required to be) a
         Loan Party may enter into any transaction described in the introductory
         paragraph of this Section, provided that immediately prior to any such
         transaction and immediately thereafter and after giving effect thereto,
         no Event of Default is or would be in existence;

                  (v) the Loan Parties and the other Subsidiaries may lease and
         sublease their respective assets, as lessor or sublessor (as the case
         may be), in the ordinary course of their business.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, without the prior written consent of all of the
Lenders (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), neither the Borrower nor
the Parent may merge with another Person if such other Person is to be the
survivor of such merger.

of or all or substantially all of the assets or stock of any Person, or any
division of any Person, whether through Investment, purchase of assets, merger
or otherwise, in each case involving consideration, or valued, in excess of
$500,000,000 unless (a) no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist
immediately following the consummation of such acquisition and (b) the Borrower
has delivered to the Agent, at least 30 days prior to the date such acquisition
is consummated, (i) all information related to such acquisition as the Agent may

         The Parent and the Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any Loan
Party or other Subsidiary to, amend, supplement, restate or otherwise modify its
articles or certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or
other similar organizational document which modification could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect without the prior written consent of
the Requisite Lenders unless such amendment, supplement, restatement or other
modification is (a) required under or as a result of the Internal Revenue Code
or other Applicable Law or (b) required to maintain the Parent's status as a
REIT.

Section 10.9.  Major Construction.

         The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary owning a
Collateral Property to, commit to undertake any plan of renovation of any
Collateral Property when (a) the estimated cost of such renovation is in excess
of $10,000,000 and (b) such renovation will result in structural changes to such
Collateral Property, without first obtaining the prior written consent of the
Requisite Lenders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
Borrower delivers to the Agent any plans, specifications, information or other
materials relating to its request to renovate a Collateral Property, the Agent
will forward such materials to the Lenders within 15 Business Days from the date
the Agent receives such materials. Unless a Lender has given written notice to
the Agent that such Lender will not consent to such renovation within 15
Business Days of receipt of all plans, specification, information and other
materials relating to the Borrower's request, such Lender shall be deemed to
have consented to such renovation.

the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Borrower, except
transactions in the ordinary course of, and pursuant to the reasonable
requirements of, the business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and
upon fair and reasonable terms which are no less favorable to the Borrower or
such Subsidiary than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction
with a Person that is not an Affiliate.

                               ARTICLE XI. DEFAULT

Section 11.1.  Events of Default.

         Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default, whatever
the reason for such event and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be
effected by operation of Applicable Law or pursuant to any judgment or order of
any Governmental Authority:

         (a) Default in Payment. The Borrower shall fail to pay when due under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document (whether upon demand, at maturity, by
reason of acceleration or otherwise) the principal of, or any accrued interest
on, any of the Advances, or shall fail to pay any of the other payment
Obligations owing by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or any other Loan Party shall fail to pay when due any payment
obligation owing by such Loan Party under any Loan Document to which it is a
party, and in any such case, such failure continues for a period of 10 days
after the date the Agent gives the Borrower notice of such failure.

         (b) Default in Performance.

                  (i) Any Loan Party or the Parent shall fail to perform or
         observe any term, covenant, condition or agreement on its part to be
         performed or observed and contained in Section 10.1. and such failure
         continues for 90 calendar days after the earlier of (x) the date any
         Senior Officer of the Borrower has actual knowledge of such failure or
         (y) the date notice of such failure has been given to the Borrower by
         the Agent; or

                  (ii) any Loan Party or the Parent shall fail to perform or
         observe any term, covenant, condition or agreement contained in this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party and not
         otherwise mentioned in this Section and such failure shall continue for
         a period of 30 calendar days after the earlier of (x) the date any
         Senior Officer of the Borrower has actual knowledge of such failure or
         (y) the date notice of such failure has been given to the Borrower by
         the Agent; provided, however, that if such default is curable but
         requires work to be performed, acts to be done or conditions to be
         remedied which, by their nature, cannot be performed, done or remedied,
         as the case may be, within such 30-day period, no Event of Default
         shall be deemed to have occurred if such Loan Party or the Parent, as
         the case may be, commences the same within such 30-day period and
         thereafter diligently and continuously prosecutes the same to
         completion, and the same is in fact completed, no later than the date
         90 days following the earlier of the date such Senior Officer has
         actual knowledge of such failure or the date the Agent gave notice of
         such failure to the Borrower.

         (c) Misrepresentations. Any written statement, representation or
warranty made or deemed made by or on behalf of any Loan Party or the Parent
under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document, or in any other writing
or statement at any time furnished by, or at the direction of, any Loan Party or
the Parent to the Agent or any Lender under or in connection with this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, shall at any time prove to have been incorrect or
misleading in any material respect when furnished or made or deemed made.

         (d) Material Extension of Credit Cross-Default.

                  (i) Extensions of Credit Owed to Lender. Any of the following

labor dispute, embargo, condemnation, act of God or public enemy, or other
casualty which causes, for more than 30 consecutive days beyond the coverage
period of any applicable business interruption insurance, the cessation or
substantial curtailment of revenue producing activities of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole but only if any such event or circumstance could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Collateral
Properties taken as a whole.

         (a) Acceleration; Termination of Facilities.

         Credit outstanding as of the date of the occurrence of such Event of
         Default and (C) all of the other Obligations of the Borrower,
         including, but not limited to, the other amounts owed to the Lenders
         and the Agent under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan
         Documents shall become immediately and automatically due and payable by
         the Borrower without presentment, demand, protest, or other notice of
         any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the Borrower, and (2)
         the Commitments and the Swingline Commitment, the obligation of the
         Lenders to make Advances hereunder, and the obligation of the Agent to
         issue Letters of Credit hereunder, shall all immediately and
         automatically terminate.

                  (ii) Optional. If any other Event of Default shall exist, the
         Agent may, and at the direction of the Requisite Lenders shall: (1)
         declare (A) the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Advances and
         the Notes at the time outstanding, (B) an amount equal to the Stated
         Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the date of the

         the Lenders and the Agent under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the

         interest on, the Swingline Loans and the Swingline Notes at the time
         outstanding, and all of the other Obligations owing to the Swingline

         or other notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the
         Borrower and (y) terminate the Swingline Commitment and the obligation
         of the Swingline Lender to make Swingline Loans.

         (b) Loan Documents. The Requisite Lenders may direct the Agent to, and

the Agent if so directed shall, exercise all other rights and remedies it may
have under any Applicable Law.

         (d) Appointment of Receiver. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver for
the Collateral Properties, without notice of any kind whatsoever and without
regard to the adequacy of any security for the Obligations or the solvency of
any party bound for its payment, to take possession of all or any portion of the
Collateral Properties and/or the business operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries related thereto and to exercise such power as the court shall
confer upon such receiver.

         Upon the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 11.1.(f), the

Section 11.4.  Curing Defaults Under Collateral Documents.

         The Lenders agree that the Borrower may cure a Default occurring under
Section 11.1.(b)(ii) relating to any Collateral Document by causing the
Collateral Property to which such Collateral Document relates to be released
from the Liens of the applicable Collateral Document in accordance with the
terms of Section 4.2.; provided, however, the provisions of this Section shall
not apply (a) to a Default the circumstances giving rise to which constitute a
Default or Event of Default under any other provision of Section 11.1. or (b)
if, after giving effect to such release, the aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Advances together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
Liabilities would exceed the Borrowing Base.

Section 11.5.  Permitted Deficiency.

         (a) Generally. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, none of the following events shall constitute a Default or Event of
Default, so long as the conditions of the immediately following subsection (b)
are satisfied:

                  (i) failure of the Borrower or any other Person owning a
Collateral Property to:

                           (A) keep such Collateral Property or any portion
                  thereof in the condition required under Section 4.6 of the
                  Security Deed applicable thereto;

                           (B) to pay any Lien or other encumbrances on any

                           (C) to comply with requirements of Applicable Law
                  applicable to any portion of such Collateral Property as
                  required under Section 3.9 of the Security Deed applicable
                  thereto;

                           (D) to prevent alterations to such Collateral
                  Property as required under Section 10.9 of this Agreement;

                           (E) to replace "Fixtures" or "Personalty" required
                  under, and as such terms are defined in, Section 5.3 of the
                  Security Deed applicable thereto; or

                           (F) to deposit with the Agent any "Casualty
                  Completion Deposit" or "Escrowed Sums" required under, and as
                  such terms are defined in, the Security Deed applicable
                  thereto; or

                  (ii) the existence of any non-consensual Lien on any of the
         Collateral not permitted by Section 8.5. of this Agreement or by the
         applicable terms of the Collateral Documents.

If the section numbering of a Security Deed differs from the section numbering
of the form of Security Deed attached hereto as Exhibit J, the references above
to specific sections of a Security Deed shall be deemed to refer to the section
in such Security Deed which most closely corresponds to the text of the
referenced section of the form of Security Deed attached hereto.

         (b) The effectiveness of the immediately preceding subsection is
subject to satisfaction of all of the following conditions:

                  (i) the sum of the following amounts (such amounts being the
         "Permitted Deficiency") does not exceed $10,000,000:

                           (A) the cost of correcting all failures described in
                  the immediately preceding subsection (a)(i), as determined by
                  Agent in its reasonable discretion;

                           (B) the amount secured by Liens described in
                  immediately preceding subsection (a)(ii); and

                           (C) the aggregate amount of unpaid "Casualty
                  Completion Deposit" and "Escrowed Sums" required under, and as
                  such terms are defined in, the Security Deeds applicable
                  thereto.

                  (ii) None of the circumstances giving rise to the Permitted
         Deficiency would otherwise constitute a Default or Event of Default but
         for the application of this Section; and

                  (iii) The Borrower is taking steps to eliminate the
         circumstances giving rise to the Permitted Deficiency in a diligent
         manner, and in all events eliminates (or bonds off to the reasonable
         satisfaction of the Agent) each such circumstances prior to the earlier
         of (A) 60 days after receipt of notice of the existence of such
         circumstances from the Agent, or (B) the date which is 5 days prior to
         the date on which any effected Collateral Property to which any such
         circumstance relates could be sold for nonpayment.

Section 11.6.  Marshaling; Payments Set Aside.

         Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to
marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other party or against or
in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any Loan Party
makes a payment or payments to the Agent and/or any Lender, or the Agent and/or
any Lender enforce their security interests or exercise their rights of setoff,
and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or
any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then to the extent of such recovery, the Obligations or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies
therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

Section 11.7.  Allocation of Proceeds.

         If an Event of Default exists and maturity of any of the Obligations
has been accelerated, all payments received by the Agent under any of the Loan
Documents, in respect of any principal of or interest on the Obligations or any
other amounts payable by the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or
thereunder, shall be applied in the following order and priority:

                  (a) amounts due to the Agent and the Lenders in respect of
         Fees and expenses due under Section 13.2.;

                  (b) amounts due to the Agent and the Lenders in respect of
         Protective Advances;

                  (c) payments of interest on Swingline Loans;

                  (d) payments of interest on principal of all other Advances,
         to be applied for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, in such order as
         the Lenders may determine in their sole discretion;

                  (e) payment of principal on Swingline Loans;

                  (f) payments of principal of all other Advances, to be applied
         for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, in such order as the Lenders
         may determine in their sole discretion;

                  (g) amounts to be paid to the Agent to be held as cash
         collateral in respect of Letters of Credit then outstanding;

                  (h) amounts due to the Agent and the Lenders pursuant to
         Sections 12.7. and 13.9.;

                  (i) payments of all other amounts due under any of the Loan
         Documents, if any, to be applied for the ratable benefit of the
         Lenders; and

                  (j) any amount remaining after application as provided above,
         shall be paid to the Borrower or whomever else may be legally entitled
         thereto.

Section 11.8.  Performance by Agent.

         If the Borrower shall fail to perform any covenant, duty or agreement
contained in any of the Loan Documents, the Agent may, but shall not be
obligated to, perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on
behalf of the Borrower after the expiration of any cure or grace periods set
forth herein. In such event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the Agent,
promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the Agent in such performance or
attempted performance to the Agent, together with interest thereon at the
applicable Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any
liability or responsibility whatsoever for the performance of any obligation of
the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Section 11.9.  Rights Cumulative.

         The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under this
Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under
Applicable Law. In exercising their respective rights and remedies the Agent and
the Lenders may be selective and no failure or delay by the Agent or any of the
Lenders in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further
exercise or the exercise of any other power or right.

                             ARTICLE XII. THE AGENT

Section 12.1.  Authorization and Action.

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to
take such action as contractual representative on such Lender's behalf and to
exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are
specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the Loan
Documents for the benefit of the Lenders. Each Lender hereby agrees that, except
as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the
exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be
authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders. Nothing herein shall be
construed to deem the Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose
on the Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms
"Agent", "agent" and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the
Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead, use of
such terms is merely a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting
parties. The Agent shall deliver to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof
by the Agent, copies of each of the financial statements, certificates, notices
and other documents delivered to the Agent pursuant to Article IX. The Agent
will also furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy (or,
where appropriate, an original) of any document, instrument, agreement,
certificate or notice furnished to the Agent by the Borrower, the Parent, any
Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document not already delivered to such Lender pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all
of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this
Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all
holders of any of the Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent shall not be required to
take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is
contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law. Not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Agent shall not exercise any right or remedy it
may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default if the Requisite Lenders have directed the Agent not to do so. Without
limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever
against the Agent as a result of the Agent acting or refraining from acting
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the
instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.

Section 12.2.  Agent's Reliance, Etc.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other
Loan Documents, neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents,
employees or counsel shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except
for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its duties expressly set forth herein or therein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Agent: may consult with legal counsel
(including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower, any other Loan Party or
the Parent), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.
Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, employees or
counsel: (a) makes any warranty or representation to any Lender or any other
Person and shall be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any
statement, warranty or representation made or deemed made by the Borrower, any
other Loan Party, the Parent or any other Person in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of
any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part
of the Borrower or other Persons or inspect the property, books or records of
the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall be responsible to any Lender for the
due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto or any Collateral covered thereby or the
perfection or priority of any Lien in favor of the Agent on behalf of the
Lenders in any such Collateral; (d) shall have any liability in respect of any
recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in
any of the Loan Documents or any other document, instrument, agreement,
certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; and (e) shall incur
any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing
(which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be
genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties. The Agent may
execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 12.3.  Notice of Defaults.

         The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has received notice
from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with
reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default." If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is
also serving as the Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it
shall promptly send to the Agent such a "notice of default". Further, if the
Agent receives such a "notice of default," the Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders.

Section 12.4.  Wells Fargo as Lender.

         Wells Fargo, as a Lender, shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement and any other Loan Document as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wells Fargo in each case in
its individual capacity. Wells Fargo and its affiliates may each accept deposits
from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as
trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party, the Parent or
any other affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to
account therefor to the other Lenders. Further, the Agent and any affiliate may
accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection
with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the
other Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Wells
Fargo or its affiliates may receive information regarding the Parent, the
Borrower, other Loan Parties, other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Person) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide
such information to them.

Section 12.5.  Approvals of Lenders.

         All communications from the Agent to any Lender requesting such
Lender's determination, consent, approval or disapproval (a) shall be given in
the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a
description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, approval,
consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where
information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall
otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved, (c) shall include, if
reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to
such Lender, written materials provided to the Agent by the Borrower in respect
of the matter or issue to be resolved, and (d) shall include the Agent's
recommended course of action or determination in respect thereof. Unless a
Lender shall give written notice to the Agent that it specifically objects to
the recommendation or determination of the Agent (together with a reasonable
written explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within 10 Business
Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the
express terms of the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication, such
Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved of or consented to such
recommendation or determination.

Section 12.6.  Lender Credit Decision, Etc.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel,
attorneys-in-fact or other affiliates has made any representations or warranties
to such Lender and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Parent, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any
other Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any such
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender
or counsel to the Agent, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents or counsel, and based on the financial statements of the
Parent, the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other
Affiliates, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the
business and affairs of the Parent, the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the
other Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the
legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own
counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or
counsel to the Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking
or not taking action under the Loan Documents. The Agent shall not be required
to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Parent, the
Borrower or any other Loan Party of the Loan Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of, or
make any other investigation of, the Parent, the Borrower, any other Loan Party
or any other Subsidiary. Except for notices, reports and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall have no duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of the Parent, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other
Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or other Affiliates.
Each Lender acknowledges that the Agent's legal counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the
Agent and is not acting as counsel to such Lender.

Section 12.7.  Indemnification of Agent.

         Regardless of whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are consummated, each Lender agrees to indemnify
the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lender's
respective Commitment Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time
be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (in its capacity as
Agent but not as a "Lender") in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, "Indemnifiable
Amounts"); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of
such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all
of the Lenders if expressly required hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute
gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to
the Agent) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect
to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any
suit or action brought by the Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents
and/or collect any Obligations, any "lender liability" suit or claim brought
against the Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the
Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws. Such expenses
(including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the
Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Agent is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Agent that the
Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the Agent is not so entitled to
indemnification. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Advances and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents and the termination of this Agreement. If the Borrower shall reimburse
the Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the
Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the
Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making
any such payment.

Section 12.8.  Collateral Matters; Protective Advances.

         (a) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent, without the necessity of
any notice to or further consent from any Lender, while no Event of Default
exists, to take any action with respect to any Collateral or Loan Documents
which may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the
Collateral granted pursuant to any of the Loan Documents.

         (b) The Lenders hereby authorize the Agent, at its option and in its
discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any
Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments and indefeasible payment and
satisfaction in full of all of the Obligations; and (ii) as expressly permitted
by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document,
including without limitation, pursuant to Section 4.2. Upon request by the Agent
at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's authority to
release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section.

         (c) Upon any sale and transfer of Collateral which is expressly
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and upon at least 5 Business
Days' prior written request by the Borrower, the Agent shall (and is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be
necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders herein or pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was
sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i) the Agent shall not be required
to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's opinion, would
expose the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence
other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty and (ii) such
release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or
any Liens upon (or obligations of the Parent, the Borrower or any other Loan
Party in respect of) all interests retained by the Parent, the Borrower or any
other Loan Party, including (without limitation) the proceeds of such sale or
transfer, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. In
the event of any sale or transfer of Collateral, or any foreclosure with respect
to any of the Collateral, the Agent shall be authorized to deduct all of the
expenses reasonably incurred by the Agent from the proceeds of any such sale,
transfer or foreclosure.

         (d) The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Lenders or to
any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the
Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary or is cared for,
protected or insured or that the Liens granted to the Agent herein or pursuant
hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected,
protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise
or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care,
disclosure or fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or
available to the Agent in this Section or in any of the Loan Documents, it being
understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or
event related thereto, the Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate,
in its sole discretion, given the Agent's own interest in the Collateral as one
of the Lenders and that the Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to
the Lenders, except to the extent resulting from its gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

         (e) The Agent may make, and shall be reimbursed by the Lenders (in
accordance with their Commitment Percentages) to the extent not reimbursed by
the Borrower for, Protective Advances during any one calendar year with respect
to each Property that is Collateral up to the sum of (i) amounts expended to pay
real estate taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon
such Property; (ii) amounts expended to pay insurance premiums for policies of
insurance related to such Property; and (iii) $500,000. Protective Advances in
excess of said sum during any calendar year for any Property that is Collateral
shall require the consent of the Requisite Lenders. The Borrower agrees to pay
on demand all Protective Advances.

Section 12.9.  Post-Foreclosure Plans.

         If all or any portion of the Collateral is acquired by the Agent or a
nominee or Subsidiary of the Agent or affiliate of the Agent as a result of a
foreclosure or the acceptance of a deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, or
is retained in satisfaction of all or any part of the Obligations, the title to
any such Collateral, or any portion thereof, shall be held in the name of the
Agent or a nominee or Subsidiary of the Agent or affiliate of the Agent, as
agent, for the ratable benefit of all Lenders. The Agent shall prepare a
recommended course of action for such Collateral (a "Post-Foreclosure Plan"),
which shall be subject to the approval of the Requisite Lenders. In accordance
with the approved Post-Foreclosure Plan, the Agent shall manage, operate,
repair, administer, complete, construct, restore or otherwise deal with the
Collateral acquired, and shall administer all transactions relating thereto,
including, without limitation, employing a management agent, leasing agent and
other agents, contractors and employees, including agents for the sale of such
Collateral, and the collecting of rents and other sums from such Collateral and
paying the expenses of such Collateral. Actions taken by the Agent with respect
to the Collateral, which are not specifically provided for in the approved
Post-Foreclosure Plan or reasonably incidental thereto, shall require the
written consent of the Requisite Lenders by way of supplement to such
Post-Foreclosure Plan. Upon demand therefor from time to time, each Lender will
contribute its share (based on its Commitment Percentage) of all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent pursuant to the approved
Post-Foreclosure Plan in connection with the construction, operation,
management, maintenance, leasing and sale of such Collateral. In addition, the
Agent shall render or cause to be rendered to each Lender, on a monthly basis,
an income and expense statement for such Collateral, and each Lender shall
promptly contribute its Commitment Percentage of any operating loss for such
Collateral, and such other expenses and operating reserves as the Agent shall
deem reasonably necessary pursuant to and in accordance with the approved
Post-Foreclosure Plan. To the extent there is net operating income from such
Collateral, the Agent shall, in accordance with the approved Post-Foreclosure
Plan, determine the amount and timing of distributions to the Lenders. All such
distributions shall be made to the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages. The Lenders acknowledge and agree that if title to any
Collateral is obtained by the Agent or its nominee, such Collateral will not be
held as a permanent investment but will be liquidated as soon as practicable.
The Agent shall undertake to sell such Collateral, at such price and upon such
terms and conditions as the Requisite Lenders reasonably shall determine to be
most advantageous to the Lenders. Any purchase money mortgage or deed of trust
taken in connection with the disposition of such Collateral in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence shall name the Agent, as agent for the
Lenders, as the beneficiary or mortgagee. In such case, the Agent and the
Lenders shall enter into an agreement with respect to such purchase money
mortgage or deed of trust defining the rights of the Lenders in the same
Commitment Percentages as provided hereunder, which agreement shall be in all
material respects similar to this Article insofar as the same is appropriate or
applicable.

Section 12.10.  Successor Agent.

         The Agent may resign at any time as Agent under the Loan Documents by
giving notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. In the event of a
material breach of its duties hereunder, the Agent may be removed as Agent under
the Loan Documents at any time by all of the Lenders (other than the Lender then
acting as Agent) and the Borrower upon 30-day's prior notice. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders (which, in the case of the removal
of the Agent as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, shall be
determined without regard to the Commitment of the Lender then acting as Agent)
shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent which appointment shall,
provided no Default or Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrower's
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days
after the current Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Lender's
removal of the current Agent, then the current Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall
be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the current Agent, and the current
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan
Documents. After any Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Article XII. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Agent
may assign its rights and duties under the Loan Documents to any of its
affiliates by giving the Borrower and each Lender prior notice.

Section 12.11.  Titled Agents.

         Each of the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents (each a
"Titled Agent") in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or
obligation hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement
or collection of any of the Advances, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for
the Lenders. The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and
imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Agent,
any Lender, the Parent, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such
titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater
than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other
than those to which any other Lender is entitled.

it has with respect to any deposit account of the Borrower or any other Loan
Party maintained with such Lender or any other account or property of the
Borrower or any other Loan Party held by such Lender other than the Collateral;
provided however, that this waiver is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
waive any right of set-off (a) any Lender has with respect to any account
required to be maintained pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or (b) arising other than pursuant to this Agreement, the Collateral Documents
or the other Loan Documents.

APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE LENDERS, THE AGENT, THE BORROWER AND THE PARENT
HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY
KIND OR NATURE IN ANY COURT OR TRIBUNAL IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE COMMENCED BY

NATURE.

         (b)______EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE PARENT, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY AGREES THAT THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF
GEORGIA OR, AT THE OPTION OF THE AGENT, ANY STATE COURT LOCATED IN FULTON

JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY
FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF

         (c)______THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY EACH
PARTY WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL
CONSEQUENCES THEREOF, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE PAYMENT OF THE ADVANCES AND ALL
OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE
TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF ALL LETTERS OF CREDIT AND THE TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

Section 13.5.  Successors and Assigns.

         (a)______Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of is rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of all the Lenders (and any such assignment or transfer to which all of the
Lenders have not consented shall be void).

         (b)______Participations. Any Lender may at any time grant to an
affiliate of such Lender, or one or more banks or other financial institutions
(each a "Participant" ) participating interests in its Commitment or the
Obligations owing to such Lender. Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.3.,
no Participant shall have any rights or benefits under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document. In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a
participating interest to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible
for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement
pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall
provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to
enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation,
the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement; provided however, such Lender may agree with the Participant
that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase
such Lender's Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of
principal on the Advances or portions thereof owing to such Lender, or (iii)
reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon. An assignment or other
transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given
effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating
interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

         (c)______Assignments. Any Lender may with the prior written consent of
the Agent and the Borrower (which consent in each case, shall not be
unreasonably withheld) at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees
(each an "Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the Notes; provided, however, (i) no such consent by the Borrower
shall be required (x) if a Default or Event of Default shall exist or (y) in the
case of an assignment to another Lender or an affiliate of another Lender; (ii)
any partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and
after giving effect to such assignment the assigning Lender retains a
Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, holds Notes having an
aggregate outstanding principal balance, of at least $10,000,000, (iii) each
such assignment shall be effected by means of an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement; and (iv) so long as the Commitments remain in effect, after giving
effect to any such assignment by the Lender then acting as the Agent, the Lender
then acting as Agent shall retain a Commitment greater than or equal to the
Commitment of each other Lender as of the Effective Date unless the Requisite
Lenders consent otherwise (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such
Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price
agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be
deemed to be a Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and
obligations of a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Lender, the Agent and the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangement so the new Notes are issued to the
Assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate. In connection with any such
assignment, the transferor Lender shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee
for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. Anything in this Section
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any
interest in any Advance held by it hereunder to the Borrower, or any of its
respective affiliates or Subsidiaries.

         (d)______Federal Reserve Bank Assignments. In addition to the
assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this
Section, and without the need to comply with any of the formal or procedural
requirements of this Section, any Lender may at any time and from time to time,
pledge and assign all or any portion of its rights under all or any of the Loan
Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge of assignment
shall release such Lender from its obligation thereunder. To facilitate any such
pledge or assignment, Agent shall, at the request of such Lender, enter into a
letter agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank in, or substantially in, the form
of the exhibit to Appendix C to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Operating
Circular No 10, as amended from time to time. No such pledge or assignment shall
release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

         (e)______Information to Assignee, Etc. A Lender may furnish any
information concerning the Parent, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other
Loan Party in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Assignees and
Participants (including prospective Assignees and Participants).

Section 13.6.  Amendments and Waivers.

         (a)______Generally. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, (i) any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement

direction of the Requisite Lenders), and, in the case of an amendment to any
Loan Document, the written consent of each Loan Party which is party thereto.

Lenders (or the Agent at the written direction of the Lenders), do any of the
following:

                  (i) increase the Commitments of the Lenders (excluding any
         increase as a result of an assignment of Commitments permitted under
         Section 13.5. or any increase of a Lender's Commitment effected in

         additional obligations;

                  (ii) reduce the principal of, or interest rates that have

         provided in Section 2.8., up to a maximum of 2 times per calendar year;

                  (iv) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of,

                  (vi) amend this Section or amend the definitions of the terms
         used in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents insofar as such
         definitions affect the substance of this Section;

                  (vii) modify the definition of the term "Requisite Lenders" or

         required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to

         (c)______Amendment of Duties of Agent or Swingline Lender. No
amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Agent, in

Documents. Any amendment, waiver or consent relating to Section 2.3. or the
obligations of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such
action, require the written consent of the Swingline Lender.

         (d)______Amendments and Waivers Generally. No waiver shall extend to or
affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent
thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein. No course of
dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be
prejudicial thereto. Any Event of Default occurring hereunder shall continue to
exist until such time as such Event of Default is waived in writing in
accordance with the terms of this Section, notwithstanding any attempted cure or
other action by the Parent, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other
Person subsequent to the occurrence of such Event of Default. Except as
otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no
notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

Section 13.7.  Nonliability of Agent and Lenders.

         The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders
and the Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender.
Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to
the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties hereto,
shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Agent or any Lender to
any Lender, the Parent, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party.
Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower
or the Parent to review or inform the Borrower or the Parent of any matter in
connection with any phase of the business or operations of the Borrower, the
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

Section 13.8.  Confidentiality.

         Except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law, the Agent and each
Lender shall utilize all non-public information obtained pursuant to the
requirements of this Agreement which has been identified as confidential or
proprietary by the Borrower or the Parent in accordance with its customary
procedure for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance
with safe and sound banking practices but in any event may make disclosure: (a)
to any of their respective affiliates (provided any such affiliate shall agree
to keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of this
Section); (b) as reasonably requested by any bona fide Assignee, Participant or
other transferee in connection with the contemplated transfer of any Commitment,
Advance or participations therein as permitted hereunder (provided they shall
agree to keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of this
Section); (c) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or
representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or in connection with any
legal proceedings; (d) to the Agent's or such Lender's independent auditors and
other professional advisors (provided they shall be notified of the confidential
nature of the information); (e) if an Event of Default exists, to any other
Person, in connection with the exercise by the Agent or the Lenders of rights
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents; and (f) to the extent such
information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (y) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or any Affiliate.

Section 13.9.  Indemnification.

         (a)______The Borrower shall and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Agent, any affiliate of the Agent and each of the Lenders and
their respective directors, officers, agents, employees and counsel (each

of every kind and nature (including, without limitation, amounts paid in

way related to: (i) this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including without

contemplated thereby; (ii) the making of any Advances or issuance of Letters of
Credit hereunder; (iii) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the

are alleged to influence directly or indirectly the business decisions or
affairs of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries or their financial condition;
(viii) the exercise of any right or remedy the Agent or the Lenders may have
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents including, but not limited to,

obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party as set forth above for any acts or
omissions of such Indemnified Party in connection with matters described in this
clause (viii) that constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (ix)
any violation or non-compliance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any
Applicable Law (including any Environmental Law) including, but not limited to,
any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by (A) the Internal Revenue Service or state

Environmental Laws.

         (b)______The Borrower's indemnification obligations under this Section
shall apply to all Indemnity Proceedings arising out of, or related to, the

13.9. and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and the provisions of Section 13.4., shall continue in full force and effect and
shall protect the Agent and the Lenders (i) notwithstanding any termination of
this Agreement, or of the other Loan Documents, against events arising after

sentence and (ii) at all times after any such party ceases to be a party to this
Agreement with respect to all matters and events existing on or prior to the
date such party ceased to be a party to this Agreement but not for a period in
excess of three years after any such party cease to be a party to this
Agreement.

Section 13.11.  Severability of Provisions.

         Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in

Section 13.12.  GOVERNING LAW.

         THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED, AND TO BE

         This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may

one and the same instrument.

Section 13.14.  Obligations with Respect to Loan Parties.

         The obligations of the Borrower to direct or prohibit the taking of
certain actions by the Parent or the other Loan Parties as specified herein
shall be absolute and not subject to any defense the Borrower may have that the
Borrower does not control the Parent or such Loan Parties.

Section 13.15.  Independence of Covenants.

         All covenants hereunder shall be given in any jurisdiction independent
effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of
such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be
otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or
condition exists.

herein embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersede

each of them has had the benefit of legal counsel of its own choice and has been
afforded an opportunity to review this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with its legal counsel and that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall be construed as if jointly drafted by the Agent, the Lenders, the Borrower
and the Parent. In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the terms and provisions of any of the other Loan Documents,
the terms of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that any term or
provision of any Collateral Document applicable to the Collateral shall be
deemed to be supplemental to, and not in conflict with, the terms and provisions
of this Agreement.

Section 13.18. AMENDMENT, RESTATEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION; NO NOVATION.

         THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE EXISTING DEBT AGREEMENTS ARE
being amended, restated AND CONSOLIDATED in THEIR entirety by this agreement for
the convenience of the parties. This Agreement merely amends, modifies, restates
AND CONSOLIDATES the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations evidenced by the
Existing Credit Agreement, THE EXISTING DEBT AGREEMENTS and the other loan
documents (as defined in the existing credit agreement) and does not constitute,
and it is the express intent of the parties hereto that this Agreement does not
effect, a novation of the existing indebtedness, liabilities and obligations
owing by the Borrower pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement OR THE EXISTING
DEBT AGREEMENTS. All such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations continue to
remain outstanding and evidenced by this agreement and the OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.
THE AMENDMENT, RESTATEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION EFFECTED HEREBY SHALL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION ONLY FROM AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE, UNLESS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

Section 13.19.  Limitation of Liability of Borrower's General Partner.

         Subject to the exceptions and qualifications described below, the
General Partner, shall not be personally liable for the payment of the
Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) if an Event of Default occurs,
nothing contained herein shall in any way prevent or hinder the Agent or the
Lenders in the enforcement or foreclosure of any Lien securing any of the
Obligations, or in the pursuit or enforcement of any right, remedy or judgment
against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or any of their respective assets;
and (b) the General Partner shall be fully liable to the Agent and the Lenders
to the same extent that the General Partner would be liable absent the foregoing
provisions of this Section: (i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation by the
General Partner, its Affiliates or predecessor general partner (i.e., the
Parent), (to the full extent of losses suffered by the Agent or any Lender by
reason of such fraud or willful misrepresentations); (ii) for the retention of
any rental income or other income in excess of operating expenses and capital
expenses arising with respect to any Collateral Property or any other Collateral
and collected by the Borrower after the Agent has given the Borrower notice (or
any Senior Officer of the Borrower has knowledge) that an Event of Default
exists and, as a result of such Event of Default, the Agent and/or the Lender
have elected to exercise any of their rights or remedies available to them as a
result thereof (to the full extent of the rental income or other income in
excess of such operating expenses and capital expenses collected by the Borrower
after the giving of any such notice or obtaining of such knowledge); (iii) for
the fair market value, as of the time of the giving of any notice (or obtaining
of any such knowledge) referred to in the immediately preceding clause (ii), of
any personalty or fixtures removed or disposed of by the Borrower (other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Deed encumbering the same) after the
giving of any notice (or obtaining of any such knowledge) referred to in the
immediately preceding clause (ii); and (iv) for the misapplication by the
Borrower (contrary to the provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents) of (x) any proceeds paid under any insurance policy by reason of
damage, loss or destruction to any portion of the Collateral (to the full extent
of such proceeds so misapplied); or (y) any proceeds or awards resulting from
the condemnation of all or any part of any of the Collateral (to the full extent
of such proceeds or awards so misapplied). No subsequent owner of Collateral
shall be liable under the immediately preceding clause (b) for the acts and
omissions of any prior owner, provided such subsequent owner and any partner
therein or other party thereto is not an Affiliate of such prior owner or any
partner therein or other party thereto, and further provided that the Agent and
the Requisite Lenders have given their prior written approval to the transfer of
such Collateral to such subsequent owner, if such approval is required under the
Loan Documents.

Section 13.20.  Limited Nature of Parent's Obligations.

         THE LENDERS AND THE AGENT ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PARENT IS
JOINING IN THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT SOLELY FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF
BEING BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE SECTIONS SPECIFICALLY APPLICABLE TO THE PARENT,
INCLUDING SECTIONS 8.1., 8.2., 8.6., 8.10., 8.11., 10.1., 10.4., 10.7., and
10.8. OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE
OCCURRENCE OF ANY DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT RESULTING FROM A BREACH BY THE PARENT OF, OR A MISREPRESENTATION BY THE
PARENT UNDER OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO, ANY OF SUCH SECTIONS SHALL NOT CREATE
ANY PERSONAL LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE PARENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE
OBLIGATIONS. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION IS INTENDED TO LIMIT THE
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARENT UNDER THE PARENT GUARANTY.

Section 13.21. Limitation of Liability of Borrower's Directors, Officers, Etc.

         The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no director, officer,
shareholder, employee or agent of the Borrower shall be held to any personal
liability, jointly or severally, for any obligation of, or claim against, the
Borrower.

Section 13.22.  Replacement of Notes.

         In the event of the loss, theft, destruction, total or partial
obliteration, mutilation or inappropriate cancellation of any Note of a Lender,
or the placement of any inappropriate marking upon any such Note, and in the
case of any such loss, theft, destruction or total obliteration, upon delivery
to the Agent on behalf of such Lender of an indemnity agreement reasonably
satisfactory to and at no expense to the Borrower or, in the case of any such
partial obliteration, mutilation, inappropriate cancellation or inappropriate
marking, upon surrendering and cancellation of such Note to the Agent on behalf
of such Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a
replacement Note, identical in form and substance to such Note and dated as of
the date of such Note and upon such execution and delivery all references in
this Agreement to Notes shall be deemed to include such replacement Note.
