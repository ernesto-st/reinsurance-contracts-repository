to Eligible Loans on behalf of that Sponsor and that is authorized on behalf of that
Sponsor to sell Eligible
Loans, may sell, and the Department shall purchase, Participation Interests in the Eligible
Loans specified on each Loan Schedule attached to each Participation Purchase Request as
the parties may execute from time to time pursuant to this Master Participation Agreement,
subject to the terms of this Master Participation Agreement. Each such Participation
Purchase Request shall be substantially in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>, attached hereto,
incorporating by reference the terms of this Master Participation Agreement, and shall be
a separate agreement among the Sponsor, an Eligible Lender Trustee (if applicable), the
Custodian and the Department with respect to the Participation Interests covered by the

Participation Agreement with any Sponsor after July&nbsp;1, 2009. Further, in order to sell any
Participation Interests pursuant to this Master Participation Agreement, the Sponsor must
notify the Department no later than July&nbsp;1, 2009 that it will sell such Participation
Interests, and must exercise the option to sell Participation Interests in Eligible Loans
on or before August&nbsp;1, 2009. The Sponsor may sell a Participation Interest after August
1, 2009 only if that interest is in a Loan that is a Purchased Eligible Loan and the
following conditions are met: (a)&nbsp;the first disbursement on the Purchased Eligible Loan
was made by July&nbsp;1, 2009, (b)&nbsp;such Loan became subject to a Participation Interest by
August&nbsp;1, 2009, (c)&nbsp;the final disbursement on such Loan is made no later than September
30, 2009, (d)&nbsp;the Sponsor notifies the Department that the Sponsor intends to redeem the
Participation Interest in the fully-disbursed Loan and sell the loan to the Department
under the Put Option, and (e)&nbsp;the Sponsor completes the sale of the Participation Interest
in the fully-disbursed Loan no later than thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days after the second
disbursement. If a Sponsor fails to meet these deadlines, as applicable, the right to sell
Participation Interests hereunder shall terminate and the Department will not honor any
commitment to purchase Participation Interests.
