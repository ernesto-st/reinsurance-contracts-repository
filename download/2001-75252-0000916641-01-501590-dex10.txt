                        AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT


1. INTRODUCTION.

a. Purchasing  Opportunities for Members.  Novation, LLC ("Novation") is engaged
in providing purchasing  opportunities with respect to high quality products and
services  to  participating  health  care  providers  ("Members").  Members  are
entitled to participate in Novation's programs through their membership or other
participatory status in either of the following client  organizations:  VHA Inc.
and University HealthSystem Consortium,  (collectively,  "Clients"). Novation is
acting  as the  exclusive  agent for each of the  Clients  and  certain  of each
Client's subsidiaries and affiliates,  respectively (and not collectively), with
respect to this Agreement.

b. Authorized Distributor.  Authorized Distributor is engaged in the business of
providing distribution services with respect to the purchasing and reselling of:
(i) the  products  described  on Exhibit A attached  hereto  which  display  the
NOVAPLUS(TM)  or VHA PLUS(R)  trademarks  ("Private Label  Products");  (ii) the
products described on Exhibit B attached hereto ("Contract Products"); and (iii)
all  other  products  which  may  be   distributed  to   Participating   Members
("Noncontract   Products")  (Private  Label  Products,   Contract  Products  and
Noncontract  Products  are  collectively  referred to as  "Products").  Novation
reserves the right to modify  Exhibits A and B from time to time for the purpose
of adding or deleting  Private  Label  Products or Contract  Products to or from
this  Agreement.  Such  distribution  services  include the services of selling,
marketing,  ordering,  paying,  order  receiving,  billing/invoicing,  handling,
storing, receiving,  inventorying,  transporting,  delivering, collecting funds,
cash application, cash management,  receivables management, payables management,
handling Member and other inquiries,  providing Member service, handling recalls
and  market  withdrawals,  providing  for  returns  permitted  by law,  handling
allowances   and  the   services   described   on  Exhibit  C  attached   hereto
(collectively, "Services").


c. Participating   Members.  Certain  Members  have  chosen  to  participate  in
Novation's  distribution  program and will be given an  opportunity to designate
Authorized  Distributor  as the  distributor  through  which those  Members will
purchase  Products.  After  completion  of the  designation  process,  a current
listing   of   Members   that   have  so   designated   Authorized   Distributor
("Participating  Members")  will be  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit D and will be
updated periodically by Novation.  Novation may replace Exhibit D with a listing
in the electronic  database described in the Guidebook referred to in Reqirement
D.5.  A Member  will  become  a  "Participating  Member"  for  purposes  of this
Agreement at the time Novation notifies  Authorized  Distributor of the addition
of the Member to Exhibit D or, if the Novation Database is utilized, at the time
Novation adds the Member to the Novation  Database as a Participating  Member. A
Member will cease to be a "Participating  Member" for purposes of this Agreement
at the time  Novation  notifies  Authorized  Distributor  of the deletion of the
Member from  Exhibit D or, if the  Novation  Database is  utilized,  at the time

                                       1
<PAGE>

Novation  deletes  the Member  from the  Novation  Database  as a  Participating
Member.


d. Supplier Agreements.  Novation and/or the Clients have entered and will, from
time to  time,  enter  into  agreements  ("Supplier  Agreements")  with  certain
manufacturers ("Suppliers") who agree to sell Contract Products or Private Label
Products to Members  through  distributors.  Novation  will  provide  Authorized
Distributor  with a listing of Supplier  Agreements and a description,  for each
listed  Supplier  Agreement,   of  certain  terms  relevant  to  this  Agreement
("Supplier  Agreement  Data") either by hard copy or, at Novation's  option,  by
maintaining the Supplier Agreement Data in the Novation Database.  Novation will
use  reasonable  efforts  to  provide  Supplier  Agreement  Data  to  Authorized
Distributor  at least  forty-five  (45) days prior to the effective date of each
Supplier  Agreement.  Authorized  Distributor  agrees to load all new or changed
Supplier  Agreement Data into  Authorized  Distributor's  computer system within
fifteen (15) days after Authorized Distributor's receipt of the hard copy of the
Supplier Agreement Data or, if Novation maintains the Supplier Agreement Data in
the Novation  Database,  within fifteen (15) days of the posting of the Supplier
Agreement Data in the Novation Database. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to
the  effective  date of each Supplier  Agreement,  Authorized  Distributor  will
supply  Novation  and  each  Participating  Member  with a report  by  printout,
diskette or electronic  transmission  (or such other format as may be reasonably
requested by Novation or the  Participating  Member)  setting  forth  Authorized
Distributor's  order entry  numbers  and prices for all  Contract  Products  and
Private  Label  Products  covered  by  that  Supplier   Agreement.   Thereafter,
Authorized Distributor will provide to Novation and each Participating Member an
updated report of order entry numbers and prices for each Supplier  Agreement no
less  frequently  than annually and at any time upon request of a  Participating
Member,  provided that Authorized Distributor will not be required to respond to
more than one such request  from the same  Participating  Member  during any one
calendar quarter.


Novation shall provide  Authorized  Distributor  with an electronic  copy of all
distributed  Supplier  Agreement  launch  packages at least 45 days prior to the
effective date. Authorized  Distributor agrees to notify Novation of any and all
situations  where  Authorized  Distributor  has received  notification  of a new
Supplier  Agreement  from  Novation,  but has not  received  contract  / pricing
notification  from the Contract Supplier at least 45 days prior to the effective
date. Such notification shall be made to Novation medical surgical  distribution
no later than 45 days prior to the effective date of the Supplier Agreement.

e. Bid.  Authorized  Distributor  has  responded  to  Novation's  Invitation  to
Bid  by  submitting  its written  offer ("Bid") to Novation  consisting of  this
Agreement,  the Exhibits to this Agreement,  and any other materials required to
be submitted in accordance with the Bid Instructions.

2. CONTRACT AWARD.

a. Letter of Award.  By executing and  delivering  the Letter of Award  attached
hereto as Exhibit E ("Award  Letter") to Authorized  Distributor,  Novation will
have accepted the Bid, and Novation and Authorized  Distributor  therefore agree
that   Authorized   Distributor   will  make  the  Services   available  to  the
Participating  Members  for the fees set  forth in  Exhibit  F  attached  hereto
("Distribution Fees") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;  provided,
however, that Novation's award of this Agreement to Authorized  Distributor will
not  constitute a commitment by any person to obtain  Services from, or purchase
any of the Products through,  Authorized Distributor. No obligations of Novation
set forth in this Agreement will be valid or enforceable against Novation unless
and until the Award Letter has been duly executed by Novation and attached as an
exhibit hereto. Authorized Distributor acknowledges that, in making its award to
Authorized  Distributor,  Novation has materially relied on all representations,
warranties and agreements made by Authorized  Distributor as part of the Bid and
that all such representations, warranties and agreements will survive acceptance
of the Bid.

b. Optional Purchasing  Arrangement.  Novation and Authorized  Distributor agree
that each  Participating  Member will have the option of purchasing the Services
and Products  under the terms of this  Agreement or under the terms of any other
distribution,  purchasing  or pricing  arrangement  that may exist  between such
Participating  Member and  Authorized  Distributor  at any time during the Term;
provided,  however, that regardless of the arrangement,  Authorized  Distributor
will comply with Sections 7 and 9 below.  If any  Participating  Member uses any
other  distribution,  purchasing or pricing  arrangement when ordering  products
from Authorized Distributor which are covered by any contract between Authorized
Distributor and Novation,  Authorized Distributor will notify such Participating
Member of the pricing and other  significant  terms of the  applicable  Novation
distribution or purchasing contract.

c. Market  Competitive  Terms.  Authorized  Distributor  agrees that the prices,
quality, value and technology of all Services provided under this Agreement will
remain  market   competitive  at  all  times  during  the  Term.  If  Authorized
Distributor  extends any offers for the  provision  of the  Services or the sale
and/or distribution of the Products during the Term [*], Authorized  Distributor
agrees to promptly (i) provide notice to Novation with copies of all such offers
and (ii) provide  Novation with copies of all responses to such offers.  If such
offers or responses are not in written form,  Authorized  Distributor  agrees to
promptly provide Novation with written  summaries of all material terms thereof.
[*] If at any time during the Term Novation receives information from any source
suggesting that Authorized  Distributor's prices,  quality,  value or technology
are  not  market  competitive,  Novation  may  provide  written  notice  of such
information to Authorized  Distributor,  and Authorized Distributor will, within
five (5)  business  days after its receipt of such  notice,  advise  Novation in
writing of [*].


 *[This confidential  information has been omitted and filed separately with
the Commission.]

d. Changes in Distribution  Fees. Except as provided in Subsection 2.c or in any
exhibit to this Agreement, the Distribution Fees will not be adjusted during the
Term.

e. Notification of Changes in Pricing Terms.  Authorized Distributor will notify
all  Participating  Members and  Novation at least thirty (30) days prior to any
change  in  pricing   terms.   For  purposes  of  the   foregoing   notification
requirements,  a change in pricing  terms will mean any change that  affects the
delivered price to the  Participating  Member,  including,  without  limitation,
changes in  Distribution  Fees (if  permitted  or required  by this  Agreement),
Prices  (as  defined  in  Subsection  7.a(2)),  Costs (as  defined  in Exhibit G
attached  hereto),  list prices,  discounts or pricing  tiers,  schedules or any
matters set forth in Exhibit H attached hereto.  Such notice will be provided in
such format and in such detail as may be required by Novation from time to time,
and will include,  at a minimum,  sufficient  information to determine line item
pricing of the Products for all affected Participating Members.

Authorized Distributor and Participating Members may agree to forego the minimum
thirty (30) day price change notification in events where a Participating Member
requests  the  stocking  of new  product(s)  or  Participating  Member  is a new
participant  on the  Agreement  and  Authorized  Distributor  is able  to  stock
product(s)  and load  pricing in less than  thirty (30) days.

f. Underutilized  Businesses.  Certain  Participating Members may be required by
law,  regulation  and/or  internal  policy  to do  business  with  underutilized
businesses such as Minority Business Enterprises (MBE),  Disadvantaged  Business
Enterprises (DBE), Small Business Enterprises (SBE), Historically  Underutilized
Businesses  (HUB)  and/or  Women-owned  Business  Enterprises  (WBE).  To assist
Novation in helping  Participating  Members meet these requirements,  Authorized
Distributor will comply with all Novation  policies and programs with respect to
such  businesses  and will provide,  on request,  Novation or any  Participating
Member  with  statistical  or  other  information  with  respect  to  Authorized
Distributor's   utilization  of  such  businesses  as  a  vendor,   distributor,
contractor or subcontractor.


g. E-Commerce  Business  Certain  Members have chosen to utilize the services of
the MARKETPLACE@NOVATION through Novation's relationship with Neoforma.com, Inc.
("Neoforma"),   to  transact  business   associated  with  this  Agreement  with
Authorized Distributor.  To assist Novation in helping Members meet those needs,
Authorized  Distributor  agrees  to sign and  comply  with the  Neoforma  Master
Supplier Agreement and support Novation's programs with respect to E-commerce.

         Distributor applies to the courts for protection from its creditors.

Novation's  right to terminate  this  Agreement due to Authorized  Distributor's

communicated by applicable  Primary Ordering  Locations (POL) to be delivered on
the next regularly scheduled delivery.  AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR shall not require

Authorized Distributor reasonably determines,  based on historical usage or data
provided by  Participating  Members,  as  necessary  to satisfy the  anticipated
requirements  of all  Participating  Members  served  by each  Primary  Ordering
Location.  Unless a Participating  Member selects a different  Primary  Ordering
Location, the Primary Ordering Location in closest geographical proximity to the
Participating   Member  will  serve  that   Participating   Member.   Authorized
Distributor will not change the  geographical  locations of the Primary Ordering
Locations without the prior written consent of Novation.

d. Computer Software. In addition to complying with the information requirements
set forth in Subsection  7.d below,  Authorized  Distributor  agrees to have and

accordance with Subsection 4.b above and receive confirmation in accordance with
Subsection 4.e below.

e. Confirmation. Authorized Distributor will provide confirmation of orders from

9. MARKETING FEES.

a. Calculation.  Authorized  Distributor will pay to Novation, as the authorized
collection  agent  for  each  of  the  Clients  and  certain  of  each  Client's
subsidiaries and affiliates, respectively (and not collectively), marketing fees
("Marketing  Fees")  belonging  to  any of  the  Clients  or  certain  of  their
subsidiaries or affiliates equal to the Agreed  Percentage of the greater of the
aggregate  Prices or  aggregate  Cost (as defined in  Subsection  7.a(2)  above)
associated  with all  purchases  of the Products by the  Participating  Members,
whether  under the pricing and other terms of this  Agreement or under the terms
of any other  purchasing  or pricing  arrangements  that may exist  between  the

10. DAMAGES.

    a. Administrative   Damages.  Novation  and   Authorized  Distributor  agree
that  Novation  would  incur  additional   administrative  costs  if  Authorized
Distributor  fails to provide  notice of change in pricing  terms as required in
Subsection 2.e above,  fails to provide  reports as required in Section 7 above,
or fails to pay  Marketing  Fees as  required  in Section 9 above,  in each case
within the time and manner required by this  Agreement.  Novation and Authorized
Distributor further agree that the additional  administrative  costs incurred by
Novation by reason of any such failure by Authorized  Distributor  is uncertain,
and they therefore agree that the following  schedule of administrative  damages
constitutes a reasonable  estimation of such costs and were determined according
to the principles of just compensation:

       1st failure                                      written warning
       2nd failure:                                       $[*]
       3rd failure:                                       $[*]
       4th failure:                                       $[*]
       5th failure:                                       $[*]
       6th & each subsequent failure:                     $[*]

Novation's  right to  recover  administrative  damages in  accordance  with this
Subsection  is in  addition  to any other  rights and  remedies  Novation or the
Clients  may have by  reason  of  Authorized  Distributor's  failure  to pay the
Marketing  Fees or provide  the  reports  or notices  within the time and manner
required by this Agreement.

       c. Service  Damages.  Novation  and  Authorized  Distributor  agree  that
          Novation  and/or  the  Participating  Members  would suffer damages if
          Authorized Distributor fails to perform  certain  of  its  obligations
          under  this  Agreement. Novation  and  Authorized  Distributor further
          agree that  the  damages suffered by Novation and/or the Participating
          Members by reason of  any such  failure by  Authorized  Distributor is
          uncertain, and they  therefore agree  that the schedule of damages set
          forth in Exhibit Z attached hereto constitutes a reasonable estimation
          of such damages  and  were determined according  to the  principles of
          just compensation. Novation's and/or a Participating Member's right to
          recover damages in accordance  with this Subsection is in  addition to
          any  other  rights  and   remedies  Novation,  the   Clients  or   the
          Participating Members may have by reason of  Authorized  Distributor's
          failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Damages above
          are only available if fill rates  are below average  when adjusted due
          to manufacturer backorders or other events beyond Distributor control.
          Remedies are only available if Novation, the  Clients and  Members are
          in full compliance with  this Agreement. "Beyond  distributor control"
          means  verified manufacturer  backorders or shipping  delays, customer
          order  errors,  inclement  weather  or  natural  disasters  preventing
          delivery  or  as  in  the section on  "force majeure", as  listed  and
          defined in this Agreement.

11. NONPAYMENT OR  INSOLVENCY OF A  PARTICIPATING  MEMBER.  If  a  Participating
Member fails to pay Authorized  Distributor for Products, or if an Participating
Member  becomes  bankrupt or insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or goes into  liquidation,  or if  proceedings  are  initiated for the
purpose  of  having  a  receiving  order or  winding  up order  made  against  a
Participating  Member,  or if a  Participating  Member applies to the courts for
protection  from its creditors,  then, in any such case, this Agreement will not
terminate,  but Authorized  Distributor will have the right,  upon prior written
notice to  Novation  and the  Participating  Member,  to  discontinue  providing
Products to that Participating Member.

12. INSURANCE.

a. Policy Requirements.  Authorized  Distributor will maintain and keep in force

complies  with the  requirements  applicable to the product  liability,  general
public  liability and property  damage  insurance set forth in Subsection  12.a.

the   Participating   Members,   or  terminate  said   liability   insurance  or
self-insurance  program  except after thirty (30) days' prior written  notice to

soon as practicable after it receives or gives them.

Distributor  will notify  Novation in writing  within  three (3) days after such
event,  and upon the  occurrence  of such  event,  whether or not such notice is

     Distributor  plus  Cost  multiplied  by  the  applicable  Base Distribution
     Service Fee from  Exhibit F.  Volume to  determine  the  Base  Distribution
     Service Fee is determined by the actual three-month purchase history of the

     three months. Volume will be recalculated on a semiannual basis and, at the
     Participating Member's election, the Base Distribution Service  Fee will be
     adjusted or the Participating Member will receive a  credit  in  an  amount
     equal to the actual Base Distribution  Service  Fee  and  the  billed  Base

SERVICE DEFINITIONS:

1)       Centralized Billing:

         A health-care  system is considered to have centralized  billing if all
         material  products and services fees associated with each entity (i.e.,
         HCO) of the system are applied to one "bill-to"  number and all invoice
         activity  conducted  by  the  supporting   Authorized   Distributor  is
         forwarded to one central  accounting  address  location.  Additionally,
         payments are forwarded to the  Authorized  Distributor in a manner that
         may reflect individual sub "bill-to" (HCO) purchase  activity,  but can
         be processed against the one system wide "bill-to" number.

2)       Centralized Ordering:

         A health-care system is considered to have centralized  ordering if all
         product  activity  for each  member  HCO in the  system  is  ultimately
         consolidated  through,  as is often the case,  one  information  system
         collection  point.  This action occurs before any  individual  facility
         purchase  activity is forwarded to the  Authorized  Distributor  in the
         form of a purchase order.  Although ordering activity at the individual
         HCOs may take place on various MIS systems,  all  purchase  activity is
         funneled  into  one  primary  system  prior to  being  released  to the
         Authorized Distributor.

3)       Centralized Delivery Point:

         A Participating Member is deemed to have one centralized delivery point
         if all  products on any given  delivery are dropped off at one physical
         location.

4)       Customized Invoice:

         An invoice is considered to be customized by the Authorized Distributor
         when the creation of the invoice requires the Authorized Distributor to
         perform  actions  other  than  what is  considered  standard  operating
         procedure  (SOP) in the generation,  delivery and/or  processing of the
         original  invoice.  An invoice is also considered to be customized when
         any  additional  documentation  that  is not  part  of  the  Authorized
         Distributor's  SOP requirement must be created to accompany the invoice
         for  delivery  to the HCO or  health-care  system.  Traditionally,  one
         standard  purchase order received from the customer will  automatically
         create one standard invoice.  Additionally,  any customization required
         may necessitate an information system change/enhancement on the part of
         the Authorized Distributor. Any changes to Authorized Distributor's SOP
         during the term of this Agreement must be approved by Novation.

5)       Customized Packing Slip:

         A  packing  slip  is  considered  to be  customized  by the  Authorized
         Distributor  when  the  creation  of  the  packing  slip  requires  the

                                       32
<PAGE>

         Authorized Distributor to perform actions other than what is considered
         standard operating procedure (SOP) in the generation and/or delivery of
         the packing  slip created from an original  purchase  order.  A packing
         slip  is  also   considered  to  be  customized   when  any  additional
         documentation  that is not  part of the  Authorized  Distributor's  SOP
         requirement  must be created to accompany the packing slip for delivery
         to the HCO or health-care system. Traditionally,  one standard purchase
         order received from the customer will automatically create one standard
         packing slip.  Any changes to Authorized  Distributor's  SOP during the
         term of this Agreement must be approved by Novation.

6)       Customized Packing Slip and Invoice:

         Combination of 4 and 5 above.

7)       Extra Deliveries:

         Participating  Members' deliveries are included in their base cost-plus
         price based on Exhibit F. All  additional  deliveries  are added to the
         base cost-plus price and priced according to the Service Fee Menu.

8)       Bulk Picked by Department, Delivered to Dock:

Exhibit F-3

                            System / Network Pricing

Participating Members shall be deemed to be part of a system or network  if they
meet either of the following criteria:
1.  Are  listed in VHA or UHC  membership  as part of a system or  network under
    one  "parent"  member  AND  are  owned,  managed,  controlled, or leased  by
    "parent" member
2.  Have joined together with other Participating  Members in local or  regional
    effort to reduce  supply  chain costs through  standardization.  Examples of

    determined by Novation.

Pricing for systems / networks will be determined as below:

A.  The  following  system  and  network  price scenario is for  acute-care-only
    systems and networks.  Systems cannot  add their other health-care  provider
    sites' volume into the pricing equation.

    1.  If Participating Members form a system / network, and the Participating
        Members  provide one  centralized  ordering  process,  one  centralized
        billing  process and one centralized  delivery point the  Participating
        Members may combine their dollar volume and be slotted according to its
        actual combined volume.
        Pricing  will be  determined  by using  Exhibit  F,  Distribution  Fees
        Matrix.  Additional  services will be applied according to Exhibit F-1,
        Additional Distribution Service Fee Menu and Definitions.

    2.  If  Participating  Members  form a system / network and do not meet the
        above criteria,  the Participating  Members' distribution fees shall be
        determined  by the dollar  volume of the largest  Participating  Member
        (defined as single ship-to) of the system / network.
        Pricing  will be  determined  by using  Exhibit  F,  Distribution  Fees
        Matrix.  Additional  services will be applied according to Exhibit F-1,
        Additional  Distribution  Service  Fee Menu and  Definitions.  In cases
        where the fees for  additional  service are volume  dependant,  the fee
        will be determined using the individual volume.

    3.  The number of deliveries  for each  Participating  Member of a system /
        network shall be determined  according to the individual  volume of the
        Participating Member. The number of deliveries will be determined using
        Exhibit F, Distribution Fees Matrix.

B.  The  following  are  definitions  of  the criteria  necessary  for accessing
    integrated  delivery  system  pricing for acute and non-acute sites.

    1.  If Participating Members form a system/network,  utilize one Authorized
        Distributor for the entire  system/network  and provide one centralized
        ordering process,  one centralized  billing process and one centralized
        delivery  point the  Participating  Members  may combine  their  dollar
        volume  (acute and  non-acute)  and be slotted  according to its actual
        combined  volume.
        Pricing  will be  determined  by  using  Exhibit  F, Distribution  Fees
        Matrix.   Additional   services  for  all sites of care will be applied
        according  to   Exhibit  F-1,   Additional  Distribution  Service   Fee
        Menu   and   Definitions.  In  cases   where  the  fees  for additional
        service are volume  dependant,  the fee will be  determined  using  the
        individual volume.

    2.  If  Participating  Members  form a system / network and do not meet the
        above criteria,  the Participating  Members' distribution fees for each
        class of trade shall be  determined by the dollar volume of the largest
        Participating  Member of the  system / network  in each class of trade.
        Participating  Members must use one Authorized  Distributor  for entire
        system/network,  or one Authorized Distributor for all acute care sites
        and one Authorized  Distributor  for non-acute  care sites,  to utilize
        this pricing option.
        Pricing will be determined by using Exhibit F, Distribution Fees Matrix
        and Exhibit F-2, Care Continuum  Distribution  Fees Matrix.  Additional
        services  for all sites of care will be  applied  according  to Exhibit
        F-1, Additional Distribution Service Fee Menu and Definitions, with the
        exception  of  deliveries  to the  non-acute  sites of care,  where the
        actual cost of delivery will be applied.

                        Customized Distribution Solutions


1.  For  VHA  and  UHC  members  that  need  to  develop  a  different  type  of
    relationship with their Authorized Distributor,  the  Participating  Member,
    Authorized  Distributor  and  Novation  will  work  together to develop  the
    relationship outside of the existing matrix concept. Examples  of  this  are
    Fee-For-Service,  Activity  Based  Costing,  Cost  Management  programs.  No
    Authorized Distributor can enter into  an  off-matrix  program  pursuant  to
    this Agreement without prior approval from Novation. Programs  that  do  not
    bring additional value to Participating Members, or  that  are   not  market
    competitive as defined in  this  Agreement, or  that  disadvantage  Novation
    contracts, NOVAPLUS(TM)or Novation  OpportUNITY(R) products or programs  are
    not permitted under  this  schedule  and/or  Agreement.  Marketing  fees  to
    Novation for any off-matrix  program other  than  O&M's  CostTrack  program,
    agreed to by Novation, the member(s) and Authorized  Distributor may  not be
    subject to Exhibit Y.

2.  Authorized  Distributors  who receive a request for proposal  or other  such
    request from a Participating  Member  requesting a  customized  distribution
    solution shall notify Novation of such request  immediately upon  receipt of
    such request  provided  the  Participating  Member issuing  the  request for
    proposal or other such request for  customized  distribution  solutions  has
    not prohibited Authorized Distributor from discussing  with Novation  or any
    other outside agencies under terms  of confidentiality.  Notification  shall
    be to Novation's  director  of  medical surgical distribution  or  his / her
    designee. Authorized Distributor shall discuss  with Novation  any  response
    to such member request  covered by  the  terms of  this  Agreement  prior to
    response to the  Participating  Member subject  to  the  foregoing  proviso.

                                  Payment Terms

                                 (No Exceptions)

Each  Participating  Member shall select from the following payment options (all
deductions  or additions  are made to the Base  Distribution  Service Fee on the
price matrix for that Participating Member):


                  _______ 15-day prepay:                      [*] credit
                  _______ Net 0 days:                         [*] credit
                  _______ Standard terms:
                  [*] purchases due [*] of same month
                  [*] purchases due [*] of following month
                  _______ Net 30 days:                        Add [*]
                  _______ Net 45 days:                        Add [*]
                  _______ Net 60 days:                        Add [*]
                  _______ Over 60 days:
                  Add additional [*] for each 15 days beyond 60 days


         All invoice terms run from the date of invoice. Credit for prepay shall
be  no  more  than  the  percent  of  the  amount  on  deposit  with  Authorized
Distributor, not the percent of the total monthly/quarterly purchases.

         Taxes,  where  applicable,  will  be  added  to the  invoice  price  of
products.

         No  Participating  Member can be put on credit hold by their Authorized
Distributor  without the  Authorized  Distributor  notifying  the  Participating
Member and Novation in writing fifteen (15) days prior to credit hold.  Novation
and the Authorized  Distributor will work  collectively to remedy the issue with
the  Participating  Member  prior  to  loss  of  credit  privileges.  If  credit
privileges are rescinded to the  Participating  Member,  then the  Participating
Member is entitled to continue to purchase  their products and services from the
Authorized Distributor on a C.O.D. basis.

         The Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) for a Participating Member is equal to
the receivable balance of the Participating  Member divided by the Average Daily
Sales of the Participating Member:
         DSO = Receivables / Average Daily Sales
Average  Daily Sales (ADS) of a Participating Member is calculated as the Annual
Sales of the  Participating  Member  divided by 360 days.
         ADS = Annual Sales / 360


     *[This confidential  information has been omitted and filed separately with
the Commission.]

                                       39
<PAGE>

Therefore, DSO is calculated as
         DSO = Receivables / (Annual Sales / 360)

         DSO  is  reviewed  semiannually,   and  all  adjustments  to  the  Base
Distribution  Service Fee will be made only on a semiannual  basis. The DSO will
be  determined  by the previous  quarter's  average DSO,  excluding any disputed
portions of invoices noted by the  Participating  Member as in  discrepancy.  No
Participating Members will be charged a higher cost-plus for DSO due to invoices
that are in dispute.  All invoice  disputes need to be reported by Participating
Member to the Authorized Distributor within thirty (30) business days of receipt
of the  invoice.  Disputed  invoices  on  which  Participating  Member  notified
Authorized  Distributor  of item(s) in dispute  are not  subject to late fees or
penalties during the resolution of the dispute.  At resolution of dispute,  late
fees or  penalties  applicable  may be applied if  Participating  Member was not
justified in disputing item(s) on invoice.

         A service  charge  may be added by the  Authorized  Distributor  to the
Participating  Member's monthly  outstanding  balance of the lesser of 1.5% (18%
annually) or the maximum  legally  allowable  rate by local law, on all invoices
not paid within the agreed-upon payment terms.

Services for Alaska and Hawaii

Bidder to describe any  modifications  to bid (including  terms / conditions and
pricing) for service in Alaska and Hawaii.

In order to service Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, Authorized  Distributor will
impose the  contract  terms of the pricing  proposal  plus actual  freight.  The
following divisions will service the areas in question:

Alaska  -         Seattle Division

                                 (No Exceptions)

Definition of "Cost"

1.   "Cost" refers to the lowest of (a) (in the case  of a Contract Product) the
     amount provided in the applicable Purchasing  Agreement as the price to  be
     billed to the  Designated  Members without  subtraction for cash  discounts
     allowed by  Vendors for  prompt payment and  prior to the  addition  of any
     distribution  service  fees,  (b)  Authorized  Distributor's  out-of-pocket
     expense in obtaining the product, including actual inbound freight  charges
     not paid or  credited  by  manufacturer  and  actually  paid by  Authorized
     Distributor not reflected on invoices from  manufacturers,  distributors or
     others or (c) the net  distributor cost  of any  product  pursuant  to  any
     agreement between the Designated Member and the vendor of such products. In
     addition to the foregoing, Cost for any  product may be  increased  by  the
     amount equal to the decrease in  prompt  payment or cash  payment  discount
     terms during the term of a Purchasing  Agreement  offered by a manufacturer
     and actually taken on a consistent  basis by  Authorized  Distributor. This
     definition of cost shall apply to all products, regardless of any  existing
     or future relationship between Authorized  Distributor and any  Contract or
     Noncontract manufacturer.


2.   Freight:  Authorized  Distributor  is required to forward to  Participating
     Member a list of manufacturers that charge freight (as allowed in section 1
     above)  and  how  that  freight   charge  will  be  handled  by  Authorized
     Distributor.  Authorized  Distributor can, if the information is available,
     put  the  exact  amount  of  the  freight  charge  impacting  a  particular
     Participating  Member or determine a freight  factor for each  manufacturer
     that  charges  freight that will be passed onto the  Participating  Member.
     Authorized  Distributor  may not charge  freight to  Participating  Members
     unless Authorized  Distributor has supplied the list of manufacturers  that
     charge freight to Participating Member in advance.

                                  Price Changes

a.   Distribution Fees (Markup). The  distribution  fees (markups) as listed  in
     Exhibit F shall remain firm for the duration of this Agreement.


b.   Ongoing Management. Novation  shall manage the key elements of the  program
     on an ongoing basis. Specifically, Novation will conduct semiannual reviews
     of the following elements:
          o  Each   Participating   Member's   purchase  volume  and  its effect
             of the organization's  base  distribution  service fee.
          o  Each   Participating  Member's  usage  of  electronic  order  entry
             and eligibility  for the  incentive
          o  Each Participating  Member's line average incentive and eligibility
             for the incentive
          o  Each   Participating   Member's   DSO  and   the  impact  upon  the
             organization's base distribution  service  fee
          o  Each   Participating  Member's  use  of   additional  services  and
             the associated fees being charged

     Novation  will  semiannually  review   and determine  any  changes  to each
     Participating   Member's  Schedule  2. Any changes will be sent to both the
     Participating Member and Authorized Distributor for review.

     If the Participating  Member or Authorized  Distributor  submits no further
     changes, the changes initiated by Novation shall go into effect thirty (30)
     days  after  notification  by  Novation.  If the  Participating  Member  or
     Authorized  Distributor  make revisions to the Schedule 2 sent by Novation,
     and all three  parties  accept  the  revisions,  Novation  will  adjust the
     Schedule  2 and send it again by  overnight  courier  to the  Participating
     Member and Authorized  Distributor.  These revisions will go into effect 30
     days after the second notification from Novation.

     No credits will be issued for positive or changed  behavior  that affects a
     Participating  Member's  distribution  service  fees.  If  a  Participating
     Member's  positive  performance  or behavior  changes have reduced its base
     distribution   service  fee,  the  Participating  Member  has  two  options
     following a semiannual review period:
          o  Both  the  Participating  Member  and  Authorized  Distributor  can
             change  their  ordering   systems  to   reflect  the  member's  new
             distribution service fees.
          o  The  Participating  Member  can  choose to receive a credit for the
             difference  between the old base distribution  service fee  and the
             new base distribution fee for the next semiannual review period.
     For  Participating  Members whose  negative  behavior has caused their base
     distribution  service  fees to rise,  both  the  Participating  Member  and
     Authorized  Distributor will change their systems to reflect the new higher
     fees.


                                       44
<PAGE>

     Participating  Members  may elect to  change  any  additional  distribution
     services  utilized (as per Exhibit F-1) at any time during this  Agreement.
     Changes in distribution  fees (markup) as a result of changes in additional
     distribution  services  utilized will be implemented  immediately  upon the
     implementation of the change in services utilized and will not have to wait
     for a semiannual  review period.  Participating  Members  requesting such a
     change shall notify  Authorized  Distributor  who shall notify  Novation of
     such request.  Novation will revise the  Participating  Member's Schedule 2
     and send the revised  schedule to the  Participating  Member and Authorized
     Distributor.
     Authorized  Distributor  shall not change a member's  distribution  service
     fees without prior consent from Novation.

     Beginning  with the end of the second six months of calendar  year 2000 and
     for each 6 months thereafter for the term of this Agreement  Novation shall
     conduct review periods according to the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity Period         Review Period          Revised Pricing Effective
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/1-6/30                7/15-8/31              10/1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
7/1-12/31               1/15-2/28              4/1
------------------------------------------------------------------------



c.   Notification of Member Price Changes: Authorized  Distributor shall provide
     participating   members   with   thirty   (30)  day  advance  price  change
     notification  for  all  Novation  contract  manufacturers  and  all   other
     manufacturers where  the  Authorized  Distributor  receives  a  minimum  of
     forty-five (45) day advance price / contract change  notification.  In  any
     event, Authorized Distributor shall load all  manufacturer  pricing  within
     fifteen 15 days of  notification  from  said  manufacturer.  In  the  event
     Authorized Distributor does not receive a minimum forty five (45) day price
     change notification from a non-contract manufacturer and  therefore  cannot
     provide  thirty  (30)   day   notification  to  the  Participating  Member,
     Authorized Distributor shall give  Participating  Member  as  much  advance
     notice of said price change as  possible,  in  any  event,  no  later  than
     fifteen (15) days after receiving manufacturer notification.  Price  change
     notification shall be on a line item specific basis (price catalog)  as per
     section 2E of the Agreement.

                                Product Delivery

Each  Participating  Member  will  be  entitled  to the  appropriate  number  of
deliveries  as  determined  by the Base  Distribution  Service  Fee  Matrix  and
excluding the following holidays:  New Year's Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor
Day,  Thanksgiving  and  Christmas.   Holiday  exclusions  shall  not  apply  to
just-in-time   (JIT)  hospitals   unless  mutually  agreed  upon  by  Authorized
Distributor and Participating  Member.  Each  Participating  Member may elect to
receive  fewer than the number of  deliveries  available for their volume or buy
additional  deliveries  at their option.  The cost of  additional  deliveries is
determined in accordance  with Exhibit F-1.  Authorized  Distributor may provide
additional deliveries to Participating Members at no additional cost if doing so
would  result  in  increased  efficiency  or  lower  costs  for  the  Authorized
Distributor   and   Participating   Member  agrees  to  accept  said  additional
deliveries.  "Delivery" is the physical  delivery to each location  specified by
the  Participating  Member of the  products  covered by all orders  received  by
Authorized Distributor prior to the standard order cut-off times.

The delivery of back ordered items (including items delivered  through Backorder
Relay)  does  not  constitute  an  additional  delivery;   however,   Authorized
Distributor shall notify the affected  Participating  Member as soon as possible
after Authorized  Distributor can reasonably  anticipate that a delivery will be
made after the scheduled  delivery time  ("Delivery  Time").  Such  notification
shall  include the  anticipated  date and time of delivery of the late  shipment
("Revised Delivery Time") and the reason for the delay.

In order to minimize the frequency and length of delays,  Authorized Distributor
shall establish a secondary  delivery  system,  which shall be used in the event
that the primary delivery method is unavailable.

                               Product Fill Rates

Fill Rate.  Authorized  Distributor shall maintain for each Participating Member
an unadjusted Fill Rate for all "A" Items of [*]. "A" Items are defined as those
items that are stock items and are ordered by the Participating  Member at least
twice  every  thirty  (30)  days.  Authorized   Distributor  shall  maintain  an
unadjusted fill rate for all items ordered (overall fill rate) of [*].

The Fill Rate is determined by completed line items filled divided by line items
ordered, first truck.

Authorized Distributor shall maintain a [*] fill rate for all items ordered on a
low unit of measure (LUM), just in time (JIT) basis.

Authorized  Distributor will provide each Participating Member within sixty (60)
days of implementation  of this Agreement the  Participating  Member's "A" Items
list,  and the Authorized  Distributor  and  Participating  Member will mutually
agree to the "A" Items list  within  ninety (90) days or the  implementation  of
this  Agreement.  Authorized  Distributor  shall  review the "A" Items list with
Participating Member no less than quarterly and shall, at Participating Member's
request,  review  such  list  with  Participating  Member  on a  monthly  basis.
Participating  Member will approve the first "A" Items list by signing  Schedule
3.  Authorized  Distributor  shall not  delete  any item from the "A" Items list
without prior written consent of Participating  Member.  Novation will take into
consideration a  manufacturer's  backorder  impact if Authorized  Distributor is
unable to meet the [*]  unadjusted  fill rates on "A" Items or [*] unadjusted on
all items only if  manufacturer's  backorder  is of such nature that  Authorized
Distributor under no circumstances can meet the fill rate obligation  defined in
this Section.


All fill rates shall not include as items  "ordered"  in such  calculations  any
item that is unavailable  because of  manufacturer  backorders or because of any
other reasons beyond Authorized Distributor's control, such as inclement weather
preventing  receipt from  manufacturer  or delivery by  Authorized  Distributor.
"Beyond Authorized Distributor's control" means verified manufacturer backorders
or  shipping  delays,  customer  order  errors,  inclement  weather  or  natural
disasters  preventing  delivery,  or as in the  section on "force  majeure",  as
listed and defined in this Agreement.

                                    Exhibit P

                                Product Stocking

Authorized  Distributor shall have the following stocking  responsibilities with
respect to Contract Products, NOVAPLUS(TM) Products and Noncontract Products:

Authorized  Distributor  will maintain  sufficient  stock of Contract  Products,
NOVAPLUS(TM)  Products and Noncontract Products to support Participating Members
at the service level set forth in this Agreement.

Authorized Distributor stocking requirements are as follows:
1.   Authorized  Distributor  must  stock  locally  all  Contract  Products  and
     NOVAPLUS(TM) Products.
2.   Authorized  Distributor  must stock  locally  all "A" items ("A" items  are
     products that are ordered at least two (2) times per month by a
     Participating Member.)
3.   Authorized  Distributor,  upon Participating  Member's request,  will stock
     locally  any other  non-"A"  Items that are ordered at least five (5) times
     per month per POL (Novation Participating Member or not).
4.   If  Participating  Member chooses not to have product  stocked  locally and
     product is not stocked locally by Authorized Distributor, the Participating
     Member can either  access these  products  directly  from the  manufacturer
     through the Authorized  Distributor  and pay all additional  charges (i.e.,
     in-bound   transportation,   drop  shipping,   etc.)  or  have   Authorized
     Distributor  ship from another location and  Participating  Member will pay
     transportation charges.
5.   Upon request of a  Participating  Member to add items to stock,  Authorized
     Distributor  will add the  items  to stock  from  any  vendor  which  meets
     industry  standards  of  good   manufacturing   practices  and  has  credit
     worthiness   comparable  to  other   vendors  with  which  the   Authorized
     Distributor does business, where the Participating Member's usage meets the
     demand levels described in Exhibit P Section 2. Within thirty (30) days, or
     industry  standard  lead-time,   of  receipt  of  usage  data,   Authorized
     Distributor  will  have the  items  in  stock  and  advise  the  requesting
     Participating  Member that the items are available at the Primary  Ordering
     Location. Authorized Distributor may refuse to stock a Noncontract Product.
6.   Authorized  Distributor  will not remove from stock at the Primary Ordering
     Location  any  product  being  purchased  by a Participating  Member unless
     Authorized  Distributor  no  longer  distributes  the  product.  Authorized
     Distributor will review its stock on an appropriate basis to identify those
     products that have generated sales of less  than five (5)  transactions per
     month. Authorized  Distributor  may then contact any  Participating  Member
     who was purchasing  these products within the last one hundred eighty (180)
     calendar  days  to  ascertain  continuing  need. If no  need  is expressed,
     Authorized  Distributor  may  give  written  notice  to  all  Participating
     Members of Authorized  Distributor's intent to remove the items from stock.
     If a  Participating  Member provides  Authorized  Distributor,  within  ten
     (10) business days after such notice, with  the Participating  Member usage
     estimates  in  excess  of  five  (5)  transactions  per  month,  Authorized
     Distributor will maintain  the items in  stock. If  Authorized  Distributor
     does not receive usage data,  Authorized  Distributor  may discontinue  the
     items the written notice of intent to remove items from stock  shall stand.

                                       55
<PAGE>

7.   From  time  to  time,  Novation  may  advise  Authorized  Distributor  that
     specified  Contract  Products are to be stocked by  Authorized  Distributor
     exclusively for Participating Members. Authorized Distributor shall use its
     best efforts to restrict  delivery of such specified  Contract  Products to
     Participating  Members,  provided  Authorized  Distributor shall be free to
     enter into  agreements  with any Vendor for  distribution  of any products,
     including products which may be Contract Products under this Agreement.
8.   If a Vendor advises Authorized  Distributor that specific Contract Products
     or Noncontract  Products will be available in reduced quantities or will be
     allocated,  and that, therefore,  Authorized Distributor may not be able to
     honor all requests for such products, Authorized Distributor will allocate,
     based on past purchasing history of the Participating Members, a portion of
     such products to  Participating  Members and shall advise  Novation and the
     Participating Members of the quantity of products so allocated.  Authorized
     Distributor  agrees that  Participating  Members  shall  receive [*] in the
     event of limited product availability.
9.   Stocking of NOVAPLUS(TM)  Products:  Authorized Distributor agrees to stock
     such amount of NOVAPLUS(TM) Products as Authorized  Distributor  reasonably
     determines  is  necessary  to  satisfy  the  usage   requirements   of  the
     Participating Members. Authorized Distributor will provide to Participating
     Members for use the  NOVAPLUS(TM)  Stocking Request Form (Exhibit T-3). Any
     individual Participating Member requesting a price change on a NOVAPLUS(TM)
     Product  shall  follow the Pricing  Protocol  described in Exhibit T-2. All
     NOVAPLUS(TM) Products that have a minimum of one transaction per month will
     be identified in Authorized Distributor inventory as such and be subject to
     appropriate  inventory by Authorized  Distributor.  Authorized  Distributor
     will use its best efforts to market and promote NOVAPLUS(TM)  Products when
     such Products meet the needs of a Participating Member.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Authorized  Distributor shall not be required to
have in stock more than  forty-five  (45) days supply of any  product,  based on
purchasing history and usage data, unless manufacturing requirements dictate the
purchase and stocking of more than 45 days of inventory.  Authorized Distributor
shall suffer no penalties or be considered in default or non-compliance with any
provision under this Agreement in the event a  Participating  Member orders more
than a  forty-five  (45) days  supply of any product  within a fifteen  (15) day
period. If a Participating  Member chooses not to have any item stocked locally,
pursuant to  paragraph  4 above,  Authorized  Distributor  is not liable for any
administrative  penalties to Novation or the Clients for the procurement of such
items.

                             Additional Requirements

1.   Sale of  Noncontract  Products.  Upon  request by a  Participating  Member,
     Authorized  Distributor  may  offer  to sell  and,  if any  such  offer  is
     accepted,  to  sell  Noncontract  Products  to the  Participating  Members.
     Participating Members may offer to buy, and if such offer is accepted,  may
     buy  Noncontract  Products from Authorized  Distributor.  In the event such
     offers,  sales or purchases are made, such offers, sales or purchases shall
     be processed by Authorized Distributor in conformity with the provisions of
     this Agreement.

2.   Backorder  Relay.  If Authorized  Distributor  fails to have an "A" Item on
     hand at a Primary  Ordering  Location  when the "A" Item is available at an
     Alternate  Distribution Center,  Authorized  Distributor  shall, at its own
     expense, be  able  to  deliver  the  "A"  Item  directly  to  the  ordering
     Participating  Member  by way of  the Primary Ordering Location or from the
     Alternate  Distribution  Center ("Backorder Relay"),  whichever is fastest.
     Contract  and  Noncontract  products to  be  delivered via Back Order Relay
     shall be delivered within 24 hours of the first delivery following  initial
     order placement. Backorder Relay is required only for "A" Items. Authorized
     Distributor  shall use Backorder  Relay  upon customer  request whenever an
     "A" Item is unavailable at a Primary Ordering Location,  regardless  of the
     cause of such unavailability  (for example, even if such  unavailability is
     caused by Vendor's backorder).  Authorized  Distributor shall use Backorder
     Relay  whenever  one or  more line  items are  unavailable  at the  Primary
     Ordering   Location.  Authorized   Distributor  will  notify  Participating
     Members by  automatic  order entry  print back,  customer  service,   sales
     representative  or  other   easonable  means  of  a  true backorder  at the
     Primary  Ordering  Location.  Participating Members, at their  option, will
     select a desired means of resolution that may include product substitution,
     maintaining backorder or order item cancellation. Each Participating Member
     will also have the option to  select a  reasonable  method  of delivery  to
     meet  the  individual  institution's service   requirements.  Participating
     Members  shall  not  be  responsible for  any  delivery charges  where such
     Backorder was the responsibility of Authorized Distributor.

3.   Backorder   Notification  Process.   Authorized  Distributor  shall  notify
     Participating  Members as soon as it becomes  aware that one or more of the
     Participating  Member's  "A" Items is or will be on  backorder  pursuant to
     this  Agreement  or  will   otherwise  be   unavailable   for  shipment  to
     Participating   Member.   Authorized   Distributor  shall  not  wait  until
     Participating   Member  orders  the  "A"  Item(s)   before   notifying  the
     Participating Member of such product unavailability.

4.   Novation Quarterly Business Review.  Authorized Distributor corporate staff
     shall meet no less frequently than once each calendar quarter with Novation
     to discuss Authorized Distributor's  performance under this Agreement. This
     quarterly  business  review  will  also be used  to  establish  performance
     targets and goals and to review progress towards such targets and goals.

                                    Exhibit U

                               Additional Remedies

1.   Change of  Authorized  Distributors. If, during  the term of the Agreement,
     a  Participating  Member  requests a change of Authorized Distributors, the
     following steps should be followed:

     A.  Indicate the reason-- service  or strategic-- for the  requested change
         on Schedule 1.
     B.  Provide the necessary  details  regarding the request on Schedule 1. If
         the requested change is  service-related,  indicate in the service area
         that  your  current  Authorized   Distributor  may  not  be  performing
         satisfactorily. If the request is strategic, please provide the details
         in the space provided.
     C.  Fax the  completed  Schedule 1 to  Novation. Novation  will  review the
         request. If the request is being made for service reasons, the  current
         Authorized  Distributor  will have 30 days to address  and  remedy  the
         situation.  After  30  days,  the  organization  has  three  options:

         1  Agree to the reassignment of  the  current  Authorized  Distributor,
            provided the Authorized  Distributor  has  satisfactorily  addressed
            the service issue.

         2  Give  additional  time to  the  current  Authorized  Distributor  to
            resolve the problem, provided the  Authorized Distributor is  making
            significant progress toward a complete remedy.

         3  Finalize the  request for a change of  Authorized  Distributors.  If
            this option is chosen, the Participating Member  notifies  Novation.
            The   organization's  Novation  account   manager  will  manage  the
            transition to a new Authorized Distributor.

     If the request is being made for  strategic  reasons,  Novation will review
     the details  contained  in the  returned  Schedule 1 and schedule a meeting
     between the member,  Novation and the current ADA to review the request and
     reach agreement that a strategic  reason for change exists and is agreed to
     by all  parties.  Following  this  meeting,  Novation can make an immediate
     decision on the request.  If it is denied,  the  participating  member will
     remain assigned to its current  Authorized  Distributor.  If the request is
     approved, your Novation account manager will manage the transition process.

     o   If the request is finalized,  the  Participating  member,  its Novation
         account  manager,  the  current  Authorized  Distributor  and  the  new
         Authorized Distributor will develop a written transition plan and begin
         the change  process.  The  Novation  account  manager  will  manage the
         transition process.

                                       73

2.   Transition Process:

     A.  Novation will notify the  Participating  Member  that  its  request  to
         change Authorized Distributors has been approved.
     B.  The  Participating  Member  indicates  on Schedule 1 the new Authorized
         Distributor  it is  requesting.  The new Authorized Distributor must be
         selected  from  the  list  of  distributors  authorized  to  serve that
         organization's market area.
     C.  The   Participating   Member,  current   Authorized   Distributor,  new
         Authorized  Distributor  and  local Novation  account  manager meet and
         agree  on  a   transition   plan  that  will  allow the new  Authorized
         Distributor to build inventory, change its system and plan to implement
         the  changes   necessary  to  serve  as  the   Participating   Member's
         distributor.  The  minimum  time  period  should be 90 days  unless all
         parties agree to an alternate  time period.  The plan also should allow
         the  current  Authorized   Distributor  to  scale  down  its  inventory
         allocated for that Participating Member.

     During the transition process, both the current Authorized  Distributor and
     new Authorized Distributor will charge the Participating Member its current
     price for distribution services. The Participating Member also will receive
     full credit for all purchases from both Authorized  Distributors during the
     transition.

     At the conclusion of the transition process, the Participating  Member, its
     current Authorized Distributor, its new Authorized Distributor and Novation
     account manager will meet to close the process.  The process should include
     satisfactory  reduction of the current Authorized  Distributor's  inventory
     for the health care organization.  The Participating  Member is responsible
     for  purchasing  all  inventory  that the  current  Authorized  Distributor
     specifically ordered for that organization.

2.   Loading of Supplier  Agreements: Authorized Distributor shall load Novation
     Supplier  Agreements  as  described  in  Section  1, subsection  d  of  the
     Agreement.  Failure to do so will subject  Authorized  Distributor  to  the
     administrative  damages   outlined  in  Section  10  of  the  Agreement.
