Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its agent
hereunder and under any other Loan Document with such powers as are specifically delegated to
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and any other Loan Document, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and any other Loan Document or
required by Law, and shall not by reason of this Agreement be a fiduciary or trustee for any Lender
except to the extent that Administrative Agent acts as an agent with respect to the receipt or
payment of funds, nor shall Administrative Agent have any fiduciary duty to Borrower nor shall any
Lender have any fiduciary duty to Borrower or any other Lender. No implied covenants,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise
exist against Administrative Agent. Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be responsible to Lenders for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower or any officer, partner or
official of Borrower or any other Person contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
in any certificate or other document or instrument referred to or provided for in, or received by
any of them under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the value, legality, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein, for the
perfection or priority of any lien securing the obligations hereunder or thereunder or for any
failure by Borrower or any Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible, except
as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence or misconduct
of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Neither
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates shall be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its
or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent.
Administrative Agent may deem and treat each Lender as the holder of its Note and interest in the
Loan for all purposes hereof and shall not be required to deal with any Person who has acquired a
Participation in the Loan from a Lender. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, in accordance with instructions signed by the Required
Lenders,

of the occurrence of a Default or of an Event of Default unless Administrative Agent has actual
knowledge thereof or has received notice from a Lender or Borrower specifying such Default or Event
of Default and stating that such notice is a &#147;Notice of Default.&#148; In the event that Administrative
Agent has such actual knowledge or receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event
of Default, Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to Lenders. Administrative Agent
shall promptly send to each Lender a copy of any notice of a Default or Event of Default that
Administrative Agent sends to Borrower or Guarantor. Administrative Agent, following consultation
with Lenders, shall (subject to Section&nbsp;7.07) take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default which is continuing, including with respect to the exercise of remedies or the
realization on, or operation or disposition of, any or all of the Mortgaged Property or any other
collateral for the Loan, as shall be directed by the Required Lenders; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that, unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received such directions,
Administrative Agent may take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interest of Lenders. In no event
shall Administrative Agent be required to take any such action which it determines would be
contrary to the Loan Documents or to Law. Each of Lenders acknowledges and agrees that no
individual Lender may separately enforce or exercise any of the provisions of any of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, the Notes) other than through Administrative Agent.

interest in the Loan, Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the

not acting as Administrative Agent, and the terms &#147;Lender&#148; and &#147;Lenders&#148; shall include
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender. Administrative Agent and its affiliates may
(without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to (on a
secured or unsecured basis), and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business
with, Borrower or Guarantor (and any affiliates of them) as if it were not acting as Administrative
Agent.

Each Lender shall pay its ratable share, based on the respective outstanding principal balances
under its Note and the other Notes, of any expenses incurred (and not paid or reimbursed by
Borrower after demand for payment is made by Administrative Agent) by or on behalf of Lenders in
connection with any Default or Event of Default, including, without limitation, costs of
enforcement of the Loan Documents and any advances to pay taxes or insurance premiums, to complete
the Improvements or otherwise to preserve the lien of the Mortgage or to preserve or protect the
Mortgaged Property. In the event a Lender fails to pay its share of expenses as aforesaid, and all
or a portion of such unpaid amount is paid by Administrative Agent and/or one or more of the other
Lenders, then the defaulting Lender shall reimburse Administrative Agent and/or

indemnify Administrative Agent (to the extent it is not paid by on or behalf of Borrower, after
demand for payment is made by Administrative Agent, under Section&nbsp;8.13 or under the applicable
provisions of any other Loan Document, but without limiting the obligation of Borrower under said
Section&nbsp;8.13 or such provisions), for such Lender&#146;s ratable share, based upon the respective
outstanding principal balances under its Note and the other Notes, of any and all liabilities,

acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance on Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
analysis of the collateral for the Loan and of the credit of Borrower and Guarantor, and its own
decision to enter into this Agreement, and that it will, independently and without reliance upon

deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Administrative Agent shall not be

may resign on at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice to Lenders and Borrower or upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default. Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with cause by
the Required Lenders, provided that Borrower and the other Lenders shall be promptly notified
thereof. Upon such resignation or removal of Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall
(provided there exists no Event of Default) be subject to Borrower&#146;s approval, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within twenty (20)
days after the resignation or the Required Lenders&#146; removal of the retiring Administrative Agent,
then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which shall be one of Lenders, within ten (10)&nbsp;days. The Required Lenders or
the retiring Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall upon the appointment of a successor
Administrative Agent promptly so notify Borrower and the other Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative
Agent&#146;s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article

the extent of the actual days elapsed in the year to which such Administration Fee relates, and
upon appointment of a successor Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall pay
to such successor a pro-rata portion of such yearly Administration Fee based upon the number of
days remaining in such year.

Agent, as the case may be (either such payment being a &#147;Required Payment&#148;), which notice shall be

any principal of its Note or of interest thereon through the exercise of any right of setoff,
banker&#146;s lien or counterclaim, or by any other means (including direct payment), and such payment
results in such Lender receiving a greater payment than it would have been entitled to had such
payment been paid directly to Administrative Agent for disbursement to Lenders, then such Lender
shall promptly purchase for cash from the other Lenders Participations in the Loan in such amounts,
and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all
Lenders shall share ratably the benefit of such payment. To such end Lenders shall make

administrative agent (&#147;Administrative Agent&#148;). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, Assignor has made an
Individual Loan Commitment to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount of $<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>

Agreement in respect of a portion of Assignor&#146;s Loan Commitment and the loan made pursuant thereto,
such portion being in an amount equal to $<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> (the &#147;Assigned Loan and Commitment&#148;), of

Borrower or Guarantor to pay when due any amounts which may become payable under the Note or
