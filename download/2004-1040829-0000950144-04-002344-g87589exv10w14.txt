and from time to time after the Effective Date and prior to the Maturity Date, a
loan or loans (each, a "Revolving Loan" and collectively, the "Revolving Loans")
to Borrower, which Revolving Loans (i) shall be denominated in Dollars, (ii)
except as hereinafter provided, shall, at the option of Borrower, be incurred
and maintained as, and/or converted into, Floating Rate Loans or LIBO Rate
Loans, provided that all Revolving Loans comprising the same Advance shall at
all times be of the same Type, (iii) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance
with the provisions hereof, and (iv) shall not exceed, in aggregate principal
amount outstanding at any time for any such Lender, such Lender's Revolving Loan
Commitment.

                  (b)      Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make, from time to time after the
Effective Date and prior to the Swingline Expiry Date, a loan or loans (each, a
"Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the "Swingline Loans") to Borrower, which
Swingline Loans (i) shall be denominated in Dollars, (ii) shall be made and
maintained as Floating Rate Loans, (iii) may be repaid and reborrowed in
accordance with the provisions hereof, provided that a Swingline Loan may not be
used to repay another Swingline Loan, (iv) shall not be made (or be required to
be made) on any date if, after giving effect thereto, the Aggregate Outstanding
Credit Exposure would exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment then in
effect and (v) shall not exceed, in aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding, the Maximum Swingline Amount. The Swingline Lender shall not be
obligated to make any Swingline Loans at a time when a Lender Default exists
unless the Swingline Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it to
eliminate the Swingline Lender's risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender's or
Lenders' participation in such Swingline Loans, which arrangements may include
the cash collateralization of such Defaulting Lender's or

                                       28
<PAGE>

Lenders' Available Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 2.1(b), the Swingline Lender shall not make any
Swingline Loan if it has actual notice that a Default exists and is continuing
until such time as the Swingline Lender shall have received written notice (i)
of the waiver of such Default by the Majority Lenders or Unanimous Lenders, as
applicable, or (ii) that the Administrative Agent in good faith believes such
Default has ceased to exist.

                  (c)In the event that (i) Borrower does not repay any
outstanding principal balance of any Swingline Loan by 2:00 p.m. New York time
on the Business Day immediately following the fifth (5th) Business Day after
such Swingline Loan was made or (ii) any Swingline Loans are outstanding on the
Swingline Expiry Date, or upon the occurrence of a Default under Section 7.6 or
Section 7.7, or upon the exercise of any remedies pursuant to Article VIII, the
Swingline Lender shall by 2:00 p.m. New York time on the immediately succeeding
Business Day give notice to the Lenders that its outstanding Swingline Loans
shall be funded with a Revolving Loans Advance. In each such case, a Revolving
Loans Advance (each such Advance, a "Mandatory Advance") shall be made on the
immediately succeeding Business Day by all Lenders pro rata based on each
Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment (determined on such date, but before giving
effect to any termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to Article
VIII) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Swingline Lender to
repay the Swingline Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each Lender
hereby irrevocably agrees to make Revolving Loans upon one (1) Business Day's
notice pursuant to each Mandatory Advance in the amount and in the manner
specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing by the
Swingline Lender notwithstanding (i) that the amount of any Mandatory Advance
may not comply with the minimum amount otherwise required hereunder in respect
of a Revolving Loans Advance, (ii) whether a Default then exists (other than a
Default by reason of which the applicable Swingline Loan was made in violation
of the last sentence of Section 2.1(b) hereof), (iii) whether any applicable
conditions precedent to an Advance hereunder have been satisfied and (iv)
provided that the applicable Swingline Loan was not made in violation of clause
(iv) or clause (v) of the first sentence of Section 2.1(b) hereof, the amount of
its Available Commitment at such time. If any Mandatory Advance cannot for any
reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without
limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to Borrower), then each Lender hereby agrees that it shall
forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Advance would otherwise have
occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from Borrower on or after such
date and prior to such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such participations
in the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause such Lenders
to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective Pro Rata
Share (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Revolving Loan
Commitments pursuant to Article VIII), provided that (x) all interest payable on
the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until the
date as of which the respective participation is required to be purchased and,
to the extent attributable to the purchased participation, shall be for the
account of the participant from and after such date and (y) at the time any
purchase of participations pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the
purchasing Lenders shall be required to pay the Swingline Lender interest on the
principal amount of the participation purchased for each day from and including
the day upon which the respective participation would otherwise have occurred to
but excluding the date of payment for such participation, at the overnight
Federal

                                       29

the Lenders to make Advances hereunder are terminated, due and payable in
arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter following the Effective Date.

termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Advances hereunder.

         2.9      Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating
Rate Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such
Floating Rate Advances are converted into LIBO Rate Advances pursuant to this
Section 2.9 (other than Swingline Loans, which at all times shall be maintained
as Floating Rate Advances) or are repaid in accordance with Sections 2.2 or 2.7.
Each LIBO Rate Advance shall continue as a LIBO Rate Advance until the end of
the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such LIBO Rate
Advance shall continue as a LIBO Rate Advance for an interest period of one
month unless (x) such LIBO Rate Advance is or was repaid in accordance with
Sections 2.2 or 2.7, (y) Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a
Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of
such Interest Period, such LIBO Rate Advance be converted to a Floating Rate
Advance or continued as a LIBO Rate Advance for an Interest Period of more than
one month or (z) a Default or Unmatured Monetary Default has occurred and
continues, in which event such LIBO Rate Advance shall, unless the Majority
Lenders otherwise agree, be automatically converted into a Floating Rate
Advance. Subject to the terms of Section 2.6, Borrower may elect from time to
time to convert all or any part of a Floating Rate Advance into a LIBO Rate
Advance (other than Swingline Loans, which at all times shall be maintained as
Floating Rate Advances). Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent
irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each conversion of a
Floating Rate Advance into a LIBO Rate Advance or continuation of a LIBO Rate
Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) at least three Business Days
prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

                  (i)      the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of
such conversion or continuation,

                  (ii)     the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is
to be converted or continued, and

                  (iii)    the amount of such Advance which is to be converted
into or continued as a LIBO Rate Advance and the duration of the Interest Period
applicable thereto.

         2.10     Interest Rate; Changes in Interest Rate; Interest Periods;
etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or
is converted from a LIBO Rate Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a LIBO
Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the
Floating Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of
any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect
simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each LIBO Rate
Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and
including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not
including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Applicable LIBO Rate
determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such LIBO Rate Advance
based upon Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and otherwise in
accordance with the terms hereof. Unless the Majority Lenders otherwise agree,
no Interest Period may be selected at any time when a Default or Unmatured
Monetary Default has occurred and is continuing. No Interest Period may end
after

                                       33
<PAGE>

the Maturity Date. All Loans comprising a LIBO Rate Advance in respect of any
single borrowing hereunder shall at all times have the same Interest Period. The
initial Interest Period for any LIBO Rate Advance shall commence on the date
such Advance is made or converted into a LIBO Rate Advance, and each Interest
Period thereafter in respect of such LIBO Rate Advance shall commence on the day
on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires.

         2.11     Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a
Default or Unmatured Monetary Default, no Advance may be made as, converted into
or continued as a LIBO Rate Advance, unless the Majority Lenders otherwise agree
(notwithstanding any provision of Section 10.2 requiring unanimous consent of
the Lenders to changes in interest rates). During the continuance of a Default
the Majority Lenders may, at their option, by notice to Borrower (which notice
may be revoked at the option of the Majority Lenders notwithstanding any
provision of Section 10.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes
in interest rates), declare that (i) each LIBO Rate Advance shall bear interest
for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise
applicable to such Interest Period plus 300 basis points, and (ii) each Floating
Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate
in effect from time to time plus 300 basis points, provided that, during the
continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Advances without any
election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         2.12     Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Office of
the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to
Borrower, by 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date when due and shall be applied
as follows:

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(b) below,
all payments of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all
payments of fees and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations, and
any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent from or for the benefit
of Borrower shall be applied in the following order:

                           (i)      to pay principal of and interest on any
portion of the Loans which the Administrative Agent may (at its sole option, and
without any obligation to do so) have advanced on behalf of any Lender (other
than itself in its capacity as a Lender) for which the Administrative Agent has
not then been reimbursed by such Lender or Borrower;

                           (ii)     to pay principal of and interest on any
Protective Advance made by the Administrative Agent (at its sole option, and
without any obligation to do so) for which the Administrative Agent has not then
been paid by Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders; and

                           (iii)    to pay all other Obligations then due and
payable and otherwise in the order designated by Borrower and, unless otherwise
designated by Borrower, all principal payments in respect of Loans shall be
applied first, to repay outstanding Floating Rate Loans,

                                       34
<PAGE>

and then to repay outstanding LIBO Rate Loans with those LIBO Rate Loans which
have earlier expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those which have
later expiring Interest Periods.

                  (b)      After the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may apply all payments in
respect of any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral to the Secured
Obligations in such order and manner as the Administrative Agent and Lenders may
elect in their sole and absolute discretion, subject, as among themselves, to
Section 10.21 hereof and any intercreditor or similar agreement from time to
time entered into among the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender
shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the
same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Office specified in a
notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.

         2.13     Notes; Evidence of Indebtedness.

                  (a)      Each Lender's Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by a
Revolving Note executed and delivered by Borrower on the Effective Date to such
Lender in the form of Exhibit A-1. Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by a
Swingline Note executed and delivered by Borrower on the Effective Date to the
Swingline Lender in the form of Exhibit A-2. If a Lender assigns a part (but
less than all) of its Note or Notes, Borrower shall, upon request, execute and
deliver new Notes to the respective owners of the original note that aggregate
the amount of the original Note or Notes, as directed jointly by the assignor
and assignee, and upon delivery of the new Note or Notes, the original Note
shall be endorsed to state that it has been replaced by such new Note or Notes.

                  (b)      Each Lender is hereby authorized to maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts
in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type
thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower
to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder from Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries maintained in the accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence, absent
manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein
recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
affect the obligation of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with
their terms.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
above or elsewhere in this Agreement, Revolving Notes and Swingline Notes shall
only be delivered to the Lenders

                                       35
<PAGE>

with Loans of the respective types which at any time specifically request the
delivery of such Notes. No failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note
evidencing its Loans shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of
Borrower to pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) which would otherwise be
evidenced thereby in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and
shall not in any way affect the guaranties therefor provided pursuant to the
various Loan Documents. At any time when any Lender requests the delivery of a
Note to evidence its Loans, Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the
respective Lender the requested Note or Notes in the appropriate amount or
amounts to evidence such Loans.

         2.14     Telephonic Notices. Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect
selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic
notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
good faith believes to be an Authorized Officer acting on behalf of Borrower, it
being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to
allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given
telephonically. Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent
a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice, signed by an Authorized Officer.
If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action
taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

         2.15     Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest
accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Quarterly Payment
Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, on
any date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to
acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of
the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a
LIBO Rate Advance on a day other than a Quarterly Payment Date shall be payable
on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each LIBO Rate Advance shall be
payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which
the LIBO Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest, commitment fees, Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees shall
be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest
shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any
payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 2:00 p.m. (Eastern
time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an
Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment.

         2.16     Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent
will notify each Lender of the contents of each Borrowing Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable
to each LIBO Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate.

         2.17     Lending Offices. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
Office selected by such Lender, and may change its Lending Office from time to
time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Office and the
Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the
benefit of any such Lending Office. Each Lender may, by written notice to the
Administrative Agent and Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate
replacement or additional Lending Offices through which Loans will be made by it
and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

         2.18     Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless
Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notify the Administrative Agent prior
to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent
of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of
Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The
Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment
to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by
the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made
available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the
period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

         2.19     Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments

                  (a) So long as the Incremental Loan Commitment Requirements
are satisfied at the time of the delivery of the request referred to below,
Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time prior to May 22,
2005, but on no more than 3 occasions, and in each case upon at least 5 Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, to request that one or
more Lenders (and/or one or more other Persons which will become Lenders as
provided below) provide Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments and, subject to
the applicable terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, make Revolving
Loans pursuant thereto; it being understood and agreed, however, that (i) no
Lender shall be obligated to provide an Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment as
a result of any such request by Borrower, (ii)

                                       37
<PAGE>

until such time, if any, as (x) such Lender has agreed in its sole discretion to
provide an Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment and executed and delivered to
the Administrative Agent an Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment Agreement in
respect thereof as provided in clause (b) of this Section 2.19 and (y) the other
conditions set forth in Section 2.19(b) shall have been satisfied, such Lender
shall not be obligated to fund any Revolving Loans in excess of its Revolving
Loan Commitment as in effect prior to giving effect to such Incremental
Revolving Loan Commitment provided pursuant to this Section 2.19, (iii) any
Lender (or, in the circumstances contemplated by clause (vi) below, any other
Person which will qualify as an Eligible Assignee) may so provide an Incremental
Revolving Loan Commitment without the consent of any other Lender, (iv) each
provision of Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments on a given date pursuant to
this Section 2.19 shall be in a minimum aggregate amount (for all Lenders
(including, in the circumstances contemplated by clause (vi) below, Eligible
Assignees who will become Lenders)) of at least $5,000,000.00 and in integral
multiples of $1,000,000.00 in excess thereof, (v) the aggregate amount of all
Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments permitted to be provided pursuant to this
Section 2.19, shall not exceed $35,000,000.00, (vi) if after Borrower has
requested the then existing Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders) to provide
Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.19, Borrower
has not received Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments in an aggregate amount
equal to that amount of the Incremental Revolving Loan Commitments which
Borrower desires to obtain pursuant to such request (as set forth in the notice
provided by Borrower as provided below), then Borrower may request Incremental
Revolving Loan Commitments from Persons reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank which would qualify as Eligible
Assignees hereunder in an aggregate amount up to such deficiency, on terms which
are no more favorable to such Eligible Assignee in any respect than the terms
offered to the Lenders, provided that any such Incremental Revolving Loan
Commitments provided by any such Eligible Assignee which is not already a Lender
shall be in a minimum amount (for such Eligible Assignee) of at least
$5,000,000.00, and (vii) all actions taken by Borrower pursuant to this Section
2.19 shall be done in coordination with the Administrative Agent.

                  (b)      In connection with the Incremental Revolving Loan
Commitments to be provided pursuant to this Section 2.19, (i) Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and each such Lender or other Eligible Assignee (each, an
"Incremental Lender") which agrees to provide an Incremental Revolving Loan
Commitment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental
Revolving Loan Commitment Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F
(appropriately completed), with the effectiveness of such Incremental Lender's
Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment to occur upon delivery of such Incremental
Revolving Loan Commitment Agreement to the Administrative Agent, the payment of
any fees required in connection therewith (including, without limitation, any
agreed upon up-front or arrangement fees owing to the Administrative Agent) and
the satisfaction of the other conditions in this Section 2.19(b) to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Incremental Loan
Commitment Requirements and any other conditions precedent agreed to by Borrower
that may be set forth in the respective Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment
Agreement shall have been satisfied, and (iii) Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an opinion or opinions, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, from counsel to Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and dated such date, covering such of the matters set forth
in the opinions of counsel delivered to the Administrative Agent on the Initial
Funding Date and such

                                       38
<PAGE>

other matters as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness
of each Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment Agreement, and at such time (i)
the Revolving Loan Commitment under, and for all purposes of, this Agreement
shall be increased by the aggregate amount of such Incremental Revolving Loan
Commitments, (ii) Schedule 1 shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised
Revolving Loan Commitments of the affected Lenders and (iii) to the extent
requested by any Incremental Lender, Revolving Notes will be issued at the
Borrower's expense, to such Incremental Lender, to be in conformity with the
requirements of Section 2.13 (with appropriate modification) to the extent
needed to reflect the new Incremental Revolving Loans made by such Incremental
Lender.

                  (c)      The aggregate principal balance of Revolving Loans
outstanding immediately prior to any increase in Revolving Loan Commitment
pursuant to the preceding subparagraph (b) shall be reallocated among the
Lenders such that from and after any such increase in Revolving Loan Commitment,
the outstanding principal balance of Revolving Loans due and payable to each
Lender shall be equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate
Outstanding Credit Exposure with respect to Revolving Loans. Those Lenders whose
Revolving Loan Commitment has increased as shown on Schedule 1 (as deemed
modified pursuant to the preceding subparagraph (b)) shall advance the funds
necessary to effect the increase in their respective Pro Rata Shares to the
Administrative Agent and the funds so advanced shall be immediately thereafter
distributed among the Lenders whose Pro Rata Shares have decreased as necessary
to accomplish the required reallocation of outstanding Revolving Loans. The
funds so advanced shall be Floating Rate Advances until converted to LIBO Rate
Advances. To the extent such reallocation results in certain Lenders receiving
funds which are applied to LIBO Rate Advances prior to the last day of the
applicable Interest Period, Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the affected Lenders any amounts payable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 3.4 of this Agreement.

                  (d)      Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to each Incremental Lender such fees and other amounts, if any, as
are specified in the relevant Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment Agreement,
with the fees and other amounts, if any, to be payable on the respective
Incremental Revolving Loan Commitment Date.

                  2.20     Letters of Credit.

                  (a)      Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Borrower may request that any Issuing Bank issue, at any time and
from time to time on and after the Initial Funding Date and prior to the tenth
Business Day prior to the Maturity Date (or the 30th day prior to the Maturity
Date in the case of Trade Letters of Credit), for the account of Borrower or
Parent Guarantor and for the benefit of (x) any holder (or any trustee, agent or
other similar representative for any such holders) of L/C Supportable
Obligations of Borrower or Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, an
irrevocable sight standby letter of credit, in a form customarily used by such
Issuing Bank or in such other form as has been approved by such Issuing Bank
(each such standby letter of credit, a "Standby Letter of Credit") in support of
such L/C Supportable Obligations and (y) sellers of goods, materials and
services used in the ordinary course of business of Borrower, Parent Guarantor
or any of its Subsidiaries an irrevocable sight commercial letter of credit in a
form customarily used by such Issuing Bank or in such other form

                                       39
<PAGE>

as has been approved by such Issuing Bank (each such commercial letter of
credit, a "Trade Letter of Credit," and each such Trade Letter of Credit and
each Standby Letter of Credit, a "Letter of Credit") in support of commercial
transactions of the Borrower, Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries.

                  (b)      Each Issuing Bank hereby agrees that it will (subject
to the terms and conditions contained herein), at any time and from time to time
on and after the Initial Funding Date and prior to the tenth Business Day prior
to the Maturity Date (or the 30th day prior to the Maturity Date in the case of
Trade Letters of Credit), following its receipt of the respective Letter of
Credit Request, issue for the account of Borrower or Parent Guarantor, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, one or more Letters of Credit (x)
in the case of Standby Letters of Credit, in support of such L/C Supportable
Obligations of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries as are
permitted to remain outstanding without giving rise to a Default and (y) in the
case of Trade Letters of Credit, in support of sellers of goods or materials
used in the ordinary course of business of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any of
its Subsidiaries as referenced in Section 2.20(a), provided that the respective
Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit of the
types described above if at the time of such issuance:

                           (i)      any order, judgment or decree of any
governmental authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or
restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement
of law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with jurisdiction
over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain
from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in
particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of
Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing
Bank is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the date hereof, or any
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable, in effect or known
to such Issuing Bank as of the date hereof and which such Issuing Bank
reasonably and in good faith deems material to it; or

                           (ii)     such Issuing Bank shall have received a Stop
Issue Notice from the Administrative Agent prior to the issuance of such Letter
of Credit.

                  (c)      Schedule 2.20(c) hereto contains a description of
certain letters of credit issued and outstanding on the Effective Date in
respect of which Parent Guarantor or a Subsidiary is "Applicant" (and setting
forth, with respect to each such letter of credit, (i) the name of the issuing
lender, (ii) the letter of credit number, (iii) the name(s) of the account party
or account parties, (iv) the stated amount (which shall be in U.S. dollars), (v)
the name of the beneficiary, (vi) the expiry date and (vii) whether such letter
of credit constitutes a standby letter of credit or a trade letter of credit).
Each such letter of credit, including any extension or renewal thereof (each, as
amended from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof, an
"Existing Letter of Credit") shall constitute a "Letter of Credit" and a
"Standby Letter of Credit" or a "Trade Letter of Credit", as the case may be,
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding that it was issued prior to
the Initial Funding Date and was not issued pursuant

                                       40
<PAGE>

to a Letter of Credit Request under Section 2.20.2. Any Lender hereunder which
has issued an Existing Letter of Credit shall constitute an "Issuing Bank" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

                  2.20.1   Maximum Letter of Credit Outstandings; Final
Maturities; etc.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which,
when added to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time, would exceed
$25,000,000.00, (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued if, after giving effect
thereto, the Outstanding Credit Exposure of any Lender would exceed its
Revolving Loan Commitment as then in effect, (iii) each Letter of Credit shall
by its terms terminate (A) in the case of Standby Letters of Credit, on or
before the earlier of (x) the date which occurs 12 months after the date of the
issuance thereof (although any such Standby Letter of Credit may be extendible
for successive periods of up to 12 months, but not beyond the tenth Business Day
prior to the Maturity Date, on terms acceptable to the Issuing Bank thereof) and
(y) the tenth Business Day prior to the Maturity Date and (B) in the case of
Trade Letters of Credit, on or before the earlier of (x) the date which occurs
180 days after the date of issuance thereof and (y) 30 days prior to the
Maturity Date, (iv) each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in U.S. dollars
and (v) the Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall be no less than
$250,000.00, or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the respective Issuing
Bank.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Lender Default
exists, an Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue any Letters of Credit
requested to be issued by it unless such Issuing Bank has entered into
arrangements satisfactory to it, Borrower and Parent Guarantor to eliminate such
Issuing Bank's risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit of
the Defaulting Lender or Lenders, including by cash collateralizing such
Defaulting Lender's or Lenders' Pro Rata Share of Letter of Credit Outstandings.

                  2.20.2 Letter of Credit Requests; Notices of Issuance.

                  (a) Whenever it desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for
its account, Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the respective
Issuing Bank written notice thereof prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) at least
five Business Days' (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the respective
Issuing Bank) prior to the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business
Day). Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit G (each, a "Letter of Credit
Request").

                  (b)      The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be
deemed to be a representation and warranty by Borrower that (i) such Letter of
Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements
of, Section 2.20.1 and (ii) all of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article IV shall be met at the time of such issuance. Unless the respective
Issuing Bank has received notice from the Administrative Agent before it issues
a Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in Article IV
are not satisfied on the Initial Funding Date or are not then satisfied, or that
the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section 2.20.1 (any such
notice, a "Stop Issue Notice"), then such Issuing Bank may issue the requested
Letter of Credit for the account of Borrower in accordance with such Issuing

                                       41
<PAGE>

Bank's usual and customary practices. Upon the issuance of or amendment to any
Standby Letter of Credit, the respective Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and Borrower, in writing, of such issuance or amendment,
and such notification shall be accompanied by a copy of the issued Standby
Letter of Credit or amendment thereto. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders, in writing, of such issuance or
amendment, as the case may be, and if so requested by Lender, the Administrative
Agent shall provide such Lender with a copy of the Standby Letter of Credit so
issued or such amendment, as the case may be. For Trade Letters of Credit issued
by an Issuing Bank (other than the Administrative Agent), such Issuing Bank will
send to the Administrative Agent by facsimile transmission, promptly on the
first Business Day of each week, the daily aggregate Stated Amount of Trade
Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and outstanding during the
preceding week.

                  2.20.3 Letter of Credit Participations.

                  (a) Immediately upon the issuance by the respective Issuing
Bank of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and
transferred to each Lender (other than such Issuing Bank) (each such Lender with
respect to any Letter of Credit, in its capacity under this Section 2.20.3, an
"L/C Participant"), and each such L/C Participant shall be deemed irrevocably
and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Bank,
without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, in a
percentage equal to such L/C Participant's Pro Rata Share, in such Letter of
Credit, each drawing or payment made thereunder and the obligations of Borrower
under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any guaranty pertaining thereto
(although Letter of Credit Fees shall be paid directly to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders based on their Pro Rata Shares as
provided in Section 2.20.6 and the L/C Participants shall have no right to
receive any portion of any Facing Fees). Upon any change in the Revolving Loan
Commitments or Pro Rata Shares of the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement, it is
hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid
Drawings, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant
to this Section 2.20.3 to reflect the new Pro Rata Shares.

                  (b)      In determining whether to pay under any Letter of
Credit, the respective Issuing Bank shall have no obligation relative to the L/C
Participants or any other Lenders other than to confirm that any documents
required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been
delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with the
requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken
by any Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit if taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), shall not create for such
Issuing Bank any resulting liability to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries, any Subsidiary Guarantor, any Lender or any other Person.

                  (c)      If any Issuing Bank makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full
to such Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.20.4(a), such Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each L/C Participant of such failure, and each L/C Participant
shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of

                                       42
<PAGE>

such Issuing Bank the amount of such L/C Participant's Pro Rata Share of such
unreimbursed payment in U.S. dollars and in same day funds. If the
Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any
Business Day, any L/C Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of
Credit, such L/C Participant shall make available to the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of such Issuing Bank, in U.S. dollars, such L/C Participant's
Pro Rata Share of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day
funds; provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to pay to
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share
of such unreimbursed amount for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Bank
under a Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions
constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing
Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). If and to the
extent such L/C Participant shall not have so made its Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
such Issuing Bank, such L/C Participant agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of such Issuing Bank, forthwith on demand such amount,
together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such
amount is paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Issuing Bank
at the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and at
the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans maintained as Floating Rate
Loans hereunder for each day thereafter. The failure of any L/C Participant to
make available to such Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share of any payment under any
Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other L/C Participant of its obligation
hereunder to make available to such Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share of any
unreimbursed payment with respect to a Letter of Credit on the date required, as
specified above, but no L/C Participant shall be responsible for the failure of
any other L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of such Issuing Bank such other L/C Participant's Pro Rata Share of any
such payment.

                  (d)      Whenever any Issuing Bank receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which it has received any payments from the L/C
Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Bank shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of each L/C Participant which has paid its
Pro Rata Share thereof, in U.S. dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal
to such L/C Participant's share (based upon the proportionate aggregate amount
originally funded by such L/C Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all
L/C Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and
interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.
The payment required to be made by the respective Issuing Bank to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made on the day
the respective payment of a reimbursement is received by such Issuing Bank (if
payment was actually received by such Issuing Bank prior to 12:00 Noon (local
time in the city in which such payments are to be made)).

                  (e)      The obligations of the L/C Participants to make
payments to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of each Issuing Bank with
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it shall be irrevocable and not subject
to any qualification or exception whatsoever (except as otherwise provided in
the proviso to the second sentence of Section 2.20.3(c)) and shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

                                       43
<PAGE>

                           (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

                           (ii)     the existence of any claim, setoff, defense
or other right which Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of
Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any L/C
Participant, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any
Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
transactions (including any underlying transaction between Borrower, Parent
Guarantor or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Person and the beneficiary
named in any such Letter of Credit);

                           (iii)    any draft, certificate or any other document
presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid
or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect;

                           (iv)     the surrender or impairment of any guaranty
for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan
Documents; or

                           (v)      the occurrence of any Default.

                  2.20.4 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings.

                  (a) Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the respective Issuing
Bank, by making payment in U.S. dollars and in immediately available funds
directly to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to
Article XIII for the benefit of such Issuing Bank, for any payment or
disbursement made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit issued by it
(with each such amount so paid, until reimbursed, an "Unpaid Drawing"), not
later than the Business Day after the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank
notifies Borrower of such payment or disbursement, with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Bank, to the extent not reimbursed prior to
2:00 P.M. (New York time), on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and
including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such Issuing Bank
is reimbursed by Borrower therefor at a rate per annum which shall be the
Floating Rate in effect from time to time, provided, however, to the extent such
amounts are not reimbursed prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the third
Business Day following the receipt of notice by Borrower from the Administrative
Agent or the respective Issuing Bank of such payment or disbursement or upon the
occurrence of a Default under Sections 7.6 or 7.7, interest shall thereafter
accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Bank (and until
reimbursed by Borrower) at a rate per annum which shall be the Floating Rate as
in effect from time to time plus 300 basis points, in each such case, with
interest to be payable on demand, provided further, that it is understood and
agreed that the notice referred to above in this clause (a) shall not be
required to be given if a Default under Sections 7.6 or 7.7 shall have occurred
and be continuing (in which case the Unpaid Drawings shall be due and payable
immediately without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of
which are hereby waived by Borrower) and shall bear interest at the rate
provided in the foregoing proviso). The

                                       44
<PAGE>

respective Issuing Bank shall give Borrower and the Administrative Agent (if not
the Issuing Bank under the respective Letter of Credit) prompt written notice of
each Drawing under any Letter of Credit, provided that the failure to give any
such notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the Borrower's
obligations hereunder.

                  (b)      The obligations of Borrower under this Section 2.20.4
to reimburse the respective Issuing Bank with respect to Unpaid Drawings
(including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or
defense to payment which Borrower may have or have had against any Lender
(including in its capacity as issuer of the Letter of Credit or as an L/C
Participant), including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure
of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each, a "Drawing") to conform to the
terms of the Letter of Credit or any nonapplication or misapplication by the
beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided that the respective
Issuing Bank shall be responsible for any damages (excluding consequential
damages) to Borrower for its gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) in connection with drawings
made under a Letter of Credit which did not comply or conform to the terms of
the respective Letter of Credit.

                  2.20.5 Increased Costs.

                           If at any time after the date of this Agreement, the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule, regulation, order,
guideline or request or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant with any
request or directive by any such authority (whether or not having the force of
law), shall either (i) impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit,
capital adequacy or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by any
Issuing Bank or participated in by any L/C Participant, or (ii) impose on any
Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant any other conditions relating, directly or
indirectly, to this Agreement; and the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to any Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant of issuing,
maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by any Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant
hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital with respect to Letters of
Credit (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to,
the net income or profits or franchise taxes based on net income of such Issuing
Bank or such L/C Participant pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which
it is organized or in which its principal office or applicable lending office is
located or any subdivision thereof or therein), then, upon written demand to the
Borrower by such Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant (a copy of which
certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Bank or such L/C Participant to the
Administrative Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Bank or such L/C
Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such increased cost or reduction in the amount receivable or reduction on the
rate of return on its capital. Any Issuing Bank or any L/C Participant, upon
determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section
2.20.5, will give prompt written notice thereof to Borrower which notice shall
include a certificate submitted to Borrower by such Issuing Bank or such L/C
Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Bank or
such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for the calculation of such additional amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Issuing Bank or such L/C Participant. The
certificate required to be delivered

                                       45
<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 2.20.5 shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding on Borrower.

                  2.20.6 Letter of Credit Fee; Facing Fee.

                  (a) Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to each Non-Defaulting Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment
(based on their respective Pro Rata Shares) in U.S. dollars, a fee in respect of
each Letter of Credit issued for the account of Borrower hereunder (the "Letter
of Credit Fee"), in each case for the period from and including the date of
issuance of the respective Letter of Credit (or in the case of Existing Letters
of Credit, from and including the Effective Date) to and including the date of
termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate equal to 3.50% per
annum on the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Accrued Letter of Credit
Fees shall be due and payable in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date
following the Effective Date and on the Maturity Date or on any earlier date on
which the Obligations become due and payable pursuant to the terms hereof.
Letter of Credit Fees paid or payable with respect to any Existing Letter of
Credit for periods to but not including the Effective Date shall be retained by
the Issuing Lender by whom such Existing Letter of Credit was issued.

                  (b)      Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Bank, for its
own account, in U.S. dollars, a facing fee in respect of each Letter of Credit
issued for the account of Borrower by such Issuing Bank (the "Facing Fee"), for
the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to
and including the date of the termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at
a rate equal to 1/4 of 1% per annum of the Stated Amount of such Letter of
Credit; provided that in no event shall the annual Facing Fee with respect to
any Letter of Credit be less than $500; provided further that no Facing Fee
shall be payable hereunder with respect to the Existing Letters of Credit for
periods to but not including the Effective Date, it being understood and agreed
that the Issuing Bank shall retain any facing fees paid or payable for periods
to but not including the Effective Date with respect to Existing Letters of
Credit issued by it. Accrued Facing Fees shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Maturity Date or on any earlier date on
which the Obligations become due and payable pursuant to the terms hereof.

                  (c)      Borrower shall pay, upon each payment under, issuance
of, or amendment to, any Letter of Credit, such amount as shall at the time of
such event be the administrative charge and the reasonable expenses which the
applicable Issuing Bank is generally imposing for payment under, issuance of, or
amendment to, Letters of Credit issued by it.

         2.21 Voluntary Reduction of Aggregate Available Commitment. Upon at
least three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders),
Borrower shall have the right, at any time or from time to time, without premium
or penalty, to terminate or partially reduce the Aggregate Available Commitment;
provided that (i) any partial reduction pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be
in an amount of at least $5,000,000 or, if greater, in integral multiples of
$5,000,000 thereof and (ii) no partial reduction shall be made if, after giving
effect thereto, the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate
Revolving Loan Commitment as then in effect. Each reduction to the Aggregate
Available Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.21

                                       46
<PAGE>

shall apply to reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments of the various Lenders pro
rata based on their respective Pro Rata Shares.

                  2.22     FF&E Reserve Account. (a) Borrower shall, on the
Effective Date, establish and maintain a segregated account of Borrower with the
Reserve Account Bank, which account (the "FF&E Reserve Account") shall be
subject to an Account Control Agreement, and Borrower shall deposit into the
FF&E Reserve Account, within 45 days after the last day of each Fiscal Quarter,
an amount equal to the Required FF&E Percentage of the Gross Revenues from the
Opryland Hotel Florida for such Fiscal Quarter, and shall insure that the total
deposits into the FF&E Reserve Account for each calendar year are not less than
the Required FF&E Percentage of the Gross Revenues from the Opryland Hotel
Florida for such calendar year. Borrower shall invest all funds from time to
time on deposit in the FF&E Reserve Account solely in Cash Equivalent
Investments.

                  (b)      Borrower shall be permitted to request funds from the
FF&E Reserve Account (the amount on deposit therein from time to time, the "FF&E
Reserve") from time to time as necessary, but no more often than once in any
calendar month, to pay for Permitted FF&E Expenditures as the same are incurred
in accordance with the procedures for disbursements from the FF&E Reserve
Account set forth in Section 4.3 hereof. Simultaneously with each withdrawal,
Borrower shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Administrative Agent a
complete statement and accounting of any use or disbursement of funds in the
FF&E Reserve Account, identifying the purpose, amount and type of each
expenditure and accompanied by copies of all bank statements with respect to the
FF&E Reserve Account not previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, all
certified by an Authorized Officer and by any Property Manager for the Opryland
Hotel Florida.

                  (c)      If a Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower shall have no right to request the withdrawal of any funds
from the FF&E Reserve Account, and if a Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Administrative Agent may apply or direct the Reserve Account Bank to apply
all funds then on deposit in the FF&E Reserve Account to the Secured Obligations
in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.1.

                  (d)      As soon as available and in any event within 45 days
after the close of each Fiscal Quarter and 90 days after the close of each
Fiscal Year, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Administrative Agent a statement showing Borrower's
calculations (and supporting information) of amounts then required to be
maintained in the FF&E Reserve Account and all disbursements therefrom
(identifying the purpose, amount and type of each expenditure), accompanied by
copies of all bank statements with respect to the FF&E Reserve Account received
to date and not previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, all certified
by an Authorized Officer.

         2.23 Replacement of Lender. If Borrower is required pursuant to Section
3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender's
obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances into, LIBO
Rate Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so affected
an "Affected Lender"), Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to be
charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected Lender
as a Lender party to this Agreement,

                                       47
<PAGE>

provided that no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of
such replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement,
(i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to Borrower
and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash
the Advances and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an
assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit D and to become a Lender for all
purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected
Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of
Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) Borrower shall pay to such
Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all
interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender
by Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including
without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2
and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been
due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the
Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the
replacement Lender.

                                   ARTICLE III

                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

         3.1      Yield Protection. If, on or after the Effective Date, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Office with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

                           (i)      subjects any Lender or any applicable
Lending Office to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other
than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its LIBO Rate
Loans, or

                           (ii)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any
reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
any Lender or any applicable Lending Office (other than reserves and assessments
taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to LIBO Rate
Advances), or

                           (iii)    imposes any other condition the result of
which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Office of
making, funding or maintaining its LIBO Rate Loans, or reduces any amount
receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Office in connection with its
LIBO Rate Loans or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Office to make
any payment calculated by reference to the amount of LIBO Rate Loans held or
interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,

                                       48
<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Office of making or maintaining its LIBO Rate Loans or
Revolving Loan Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or
applicable Lending Office in connection with such LIBO Rate Loans or Revolving
Loan Commitment, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, Borrower shall
pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.

         3.2      Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender, any Lending Office of such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below in this Section
3.2), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of
return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is
attributable to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Revolving
Loan Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's
policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the
Effective Date in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or
change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) after the Effective Date which affects the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Office or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the Effective Date,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the Effective Date.

         3.3      Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines
that maintenance of its LIBO Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Office would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Majority Lenders determine that by reason of
changes affecting the interbank LIBO Rate market, (i) deposits of a type and
maturity appropriate to match fund LIBO Rate Advances are not available or (ii)
the interest rate applicable to LIBO Rate Advances does not accurately reflect
the cost of making or maintaining LIBO Rate Advances, then the Administrative
Agent shall suspend the availability of LIBO Rate Advances until the first date
on which the circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist and require
any affected LIBO Rate Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

         3.4      Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a LIBO Rate Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a LIBO Rate Advance
is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than
default by the Lenders, Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost
incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or
cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such LIBO
Rate Advance, provided that such indemnity shall not

                                       49
<PAGE>

apply to any such loss or cost incurred solely by reason of an adjustment to any
Interest Period made by the Administrative Agent in connection with syndicating
the Loans.

         3.5      Taxes. (i) All payments by Borrower to or for the account of
any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If Borrower shall
be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the sum payable shall
be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(b) Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d)
Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

                           (ii)     In addition, Borrower hereby agrees to pay
any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

                           (iii)    Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts
payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender
and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand
therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

                           (iv)     Each Lender that is not incorporated under
the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S.
Lender") agrees that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the
Effective Date (or such later date upon which it becomes a Lender hereunder),
deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of
United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in
either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, or backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to
deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional
copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form
expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by Borrower or the
Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding
sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable
or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such
form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises Borrower and

                                       50
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without
any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

                           (v)      For any period during which a Non-U.S.
Lender has failed to provide Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to
clause (iv) above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed
by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise
exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to
Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv),
above, Borrower shall take such steps (but without material expense to Borrower)
as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender
to recover such Taxes.

                           (vi)     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
Agreement or any Notes pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any
treaty shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at
the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments
to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

                           (vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any
other governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
(because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because
such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for
any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and
Borrower fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be, as tax, withholding
therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or
Borrower under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related
thereto (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the
Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be, which attorneys may be
employees of the Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be). The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment
of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.6      Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent
reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Office
with respect to its LIBO Rate Loans to reduce any liability of Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of LIBO
Rate Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the
judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on

                                       51
<PAGE>

Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable
under such Sections in connection with a LIBO Rate Loan shall be calculated as
though each Lender funded its LIBO Rate Loan through the purchase of a deposit
of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in
determining the LIBO Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the
case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the
written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by
Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of Borrower under Sections
3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination
of this Agreement.

         3.7      Reasonable Efforts to Mitigate. Each Lender shall use its
reasonable best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and
regulatory restrictions) to minimize any amounts payable by Borrower under
Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 and to minimize any period of illegality under
Section 3.3. Each Lender further agrees to notify Borrower promptly, but in any
event within 30 Business Days, after such Lender learns of the circumstances
giving rise to such a right of payment or such illegality or any circumstances
that have changed such that such right to payment or such illegality, as the
case may be, no longer exists.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Borrower and Parent Guarantor each represent and warrant to the Lenders
that, as of the Effective Date, and thereafter whenever the representations and
warranties under this Article V are updated, remade or deemed to be remade:

         5.1      Ownership, Existence and Standing. Borrower, Parent Guarantor
and each Subsidiary Guarantor is a corporation, limited partnership or limited
liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may
be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted. True, correct and complete
copies of the Organizational Documents of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and each
Subsidiary Guarantor have been delivered to the Administrative Agent, each of
which is in full force and effect, has not been modified or amended except to
the

                                       56
<PAGE>

extent set forth therein and there are no defaults under such Organizational
Documents and, to the best of Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's knowledge, no
events exist which, with the passage of time or giving of notice or both, would
constitute a default under such Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof,
the ownership structure of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary
Guarantors, and all direct and indirect owners of membership interests therein
are completely and accurately disclosed on the ownership chart attached as
Schedule 5.1. Borrower is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section
1445 of the Internal Revenue Code.

         5.2      Authorization and Validity. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and
each Subsidiary Guarantor has the power and authority and legal right to execute
and deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by Borrower, Parent Guarantor
or any Subsidiary Guarantor of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the
performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper
corporate or company proceedings. Each of the Loan Documents to which Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party (A) has been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary
Guarantors, as the case may be, (B) to the extent the same constitutes a
security agreement or a collateral document, creates valid first Liens in the
Collateral covered thereby, securing the payment of all of the Secured
Obligations purported to be secured thereby, (C) assuming due authorization and
execution by the Lenders party thereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors, as the
case may be, enforceable against such Person, in accordance with its terms
except to the extent that the enforcement thereof or the availability of
equitable remedies may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by general
principles of equity, or by the discretion of any court of competent
jurisdiction in awarding equitable remedies, regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and (D) is in full
force and effect. All the terms, provisions, agreements and conditions set forth
in the Loan Documents and required to be performed or complied with by Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors have been performed or complied
with and no Default or breach of any covenant by any such Person exists
thereunder.

         5.3      No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Loan
Documents to which any of them is a party, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on any such Person or (ii) such Person's articles or
certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership,
articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or limited liability company
operating agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any
indenture, instrument or agreement to which such Person is a party or is
subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the property of such Person pursuant to the
terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent,
adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing,
recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of
any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which
has not been obtained by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the

                                       57
<PAGE>

Subsidiary Guarantors, is required to be obtained by any of them in connection
with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this
Agreement, the payment and performance by Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the
Subsidiary Guarantors of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding
effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.

         5.4      Financial Statements and Projections. The historical financial
statements of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors
heretofore delivered to the Lenders (a) in the case of Parent Guarantor, were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect
on the date such statements were prepared and (b) in the case of Borrower and
the Subsidiary Guarantors, were not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for presentation on a stand-alone basis, but were
prepared in a manner customary for division reporting into a consolidated group

financial statements referred to in the preceding sentence fairly present the
financial condition and operations of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the
Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, at such date and the results of its
operations for the period then ended. Since December 31, 2002 and through the
Effective Date, there has been no material adverse change in the business,
operations, property or condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent Guarantor's
Subsidiaries (other than Borrower) taken as a whole or Parent Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or Borrower. All financial projections with
respect to Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors heretofore
delivered to Lenders, including, without limitation, financial projections for
the Opryland Hotel Florida represent reasonable estimates of future performance
and financial condition, subject to uncertainties and approximations inherent in
the making of any financial projections and without assurance that the projected
performance and financial condition actually will be achieved.

Guarantor's or any Subsidiary Guarantor's assets (including the Opryland Hotel
Florida), receipts, sales, use, payroll, employment, income, licenses and
franchises which are due and payable have been paid, except to the extent such
taxes, assessments, fees and other charges of Governmental Authorities are being
contested in good faith by an appropriate proceeding diligently pursued with the
security delivered as and to the extent required by the terms of Section 6.5.
Borrower has no knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or the Opryland Hotel Florida that
will have or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No tax
liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such
Taxes. Borrower qualifies for partnership pass-through entity treatment under
United States federal tax law.

inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened (a)

Neither the making of the Loans nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate
or be inconsistent with the provisions of Regulation T, Regulation U or
Regulation X.

         5.12     Material Agreements. Neither Borrower, Parent Guarantor nor
any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to
any charter or other corporate or company restriction which could

                                       59
<PAGE>

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Borrower,
Parent Guarantor nor any Subsidiary Guarantor is in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any material obligation, covenant or condition
contained in (i) any agreement to which it is a party, which default could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement
or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

         5.13     Compliance With Laws. Except where any failure to comply would
not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, property,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any of them, Borrower, Parent

applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic

easements, covenants, conditions, and other encumbrances, except Liens securing
the Secured Obligations and Customary Permitted Liens. Except as otherwise
described in Schedule 5.14, all Property owned by, leased to or used by Borrower
is in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, is
free and clear of any known defects except such defects as do not substantially
interfere with the continued use thereof in the conduct of normal operations,
and is able to serve the function for which it is currently being used. Neither
this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, nor any transaction contemplated
under any such agreement, will affect any right, title or interest of Borrower
in and to any of such Property (other than Liens in favor of the Administrative

satisfactory to the mortgagee and shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent in form and content. Business interruption insurance
shall name the Administrative Agent as Loss Payee. All Property insurance
policies also shall include a co-insurance waiver and Agreed Amount Endorsement.
The amount of any deductible under any insurance policy must be consistent with
similar projects managed by Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries. Without
the Administrative Agent's prior written consent, neither Borrower, Parent
Guarantor nor any Property Manager shall carry separate or additional insurance
coverage covering the Improvements concurrent in

                                       70

form or contributing in the event of loss with that required by this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent, on reasonable prior
notice to Parent Guarantor, may examine the insurance policies (whether in the
possession of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or an Affiliate of either) during
business hours.

                  (d)      Borrower, Parent Guarantor and any Property Manager
shall pay the premiums for the insurance policies required hereunder as the same
become due and payable. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and any Property Manager
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent certificates of the insurance policies
(on forms acceptable to the Administrative Agent) required to be maintained
pursuant to this Agreement provided, however, the Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall not be deemed by reason of the custody of such certificates to
have knowledge of the contents thereof. Borrower and Parent Guarantor also shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days of the Administrative
Agent's request, a certificate of Borrower and Parent Guarantor or their
insurance agent setting forth the particulars as to all such insurance policies.
Prior to the expiration date of each of the insurance policies Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of insurance evidencing
renewal of coverage as required herein.

                  (e)      Each insurance certificate required hereunder shall
contain a provision whereby the insurer (i) agrees that such policy shall not be
canceled, terminated or reduced in coverage or limits below the coverage and
limits of insurance required by this Agreement, without in each case, at least
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, (ii) waives
any right to claim any premiums and commissions against the Administrative Agent
or any Lender, provided that the policy need not waive the requirement that the
premium be paid in order for a claim to be paid to the insured and (iii)
provides that the Administrative Agent is permitted to make payments to effect
the continuation of such policy upon notice of cancellation due to non-payment
of premiums. In the event any insurance policy (except for general public,
automobile and other liability and Workers Compensation insurance or any other
similar policies) shall contain breach of warranty provisions, such policy shall
provide that with respect to the interest of the Administrative Agent and
Lenders, such insurance policy shall not be invalidated by and shall insure the
Administrative Agent and Lenders regardless of (A) any act, failure to act or
negligence of or violation of warranties, declarations or conditions contained
in such policy by any named insured, (B) the occupancy or use of the premises
for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms thereof, or (C) any
foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to any provision of the Mortgage or any of the Loan Documents.

                  (f)      Any insurance maintained pursuant to this Agreement
may be evidenced by blanket insurance policies covering the Opryland Hotel
Florida and other properties or assets of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and any
Property Manager or their affiliates, provided that any such policy shall in all
other respects substantially fulfill the requirements of this section.

                  (g)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if at any time the Administrative Agent is not in receipt of written
evidence that all insurance required hereunder is maintained in full force and
effect, the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation),
upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to Borrower or Parent Guarantor (or
such lesser notice as may be necessary to prevent the lapse of insurance
coverage), to take

                                       71
<PAGE>

such action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect its interests
in the Opryland Hotel Florida, including, without limitation, the obtaining of
such insurance coverage as the Administrative Agent deems appropriate, and all
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such action
will be paid by Borrower or Parent Guarantor on demand.

         6.7      Compliance with Laws. Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and
Parent Guarantor shall cause all of its Subsidiaries to, (a) comply in all
material respects with all Requirements of Law and all restrictive covenants
affecting their respective businesses, Properties, assets and operations, and
(b) obtain and maintain as needed all Permits necessary for their operations and
maintain such Permits in good standing. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower
and Parent Guarantor shall comply in all respects with all Environmental Laws
with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida and shall not suffer or permit the
Release or disposal of Contaminants at the Opryland Hotel Florida in any manner
that, in any single instance or in the aggregate, would violate Environmental
Laws.

         6.8      Alterations. Neither Borrower nor Parent Guarantor shall,
without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, make, suffer or
permit any structural alterations to the Opryland Hotel Florida (other than as
contemplated by the Approved FF&E Budget of Borrower) having a cost in excess of
$2,000,000.00 in any Fiscal Year.

         6.9      Inspections; Books and Records.

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent, and any authorized
representative(s) designated by the Administrative Agent, shall have the right
at all reasonable times on reasonable notice (and (i) for so long as no Default
exists, at Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's expense, provided that such
inspections and examinations do not take place more often than annually, and
otherwise at the expense of the Lenders and (ii) from and after the occurrence
of a Default, at Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's expense) and any other Lender
shall have the right at its own expense: (i) to enter upon and inspect the
Properties of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors
(including the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Texas Project), as part of the
Administrative Agent's general oversight (both prior to and after Substantial
Completion); and (ii) to examine, copy and make extracts of the books, records,
accounting data and other documents of Borrower, Parent Guarantor, any Property
Manager and the Subsidiary Guarantors, whether or not the same relate in any way
to the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Texas Project, all of which shall be made
available promptly upon the Administrative Agent's written demand therefor
(including in connection with environmental compliance, hazard or liability),
and to discuss Borrower's, Parent Guarantor's, the Subsidiary Guarantors' and
other Subsidiaries' and any Property Manager's affairs, finances and accounts,
including, but not limited to, matters relating to the Opryland Hotel Florida
and the Texas Project, with their respective executive officers, as applicable,
all upon reasonable notice and at such reasonable times during normal business
hours, as often as may be reasonably requested. At the request of the
Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall furnish convenient
facilities for the purposes of conducting such investigations and examinations.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have
no duty to supervise or to inspect the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Texas
Project (or any other Property) or any books

                                       72
<PAGE>

and records, that any such inspection shall be for the sole purposes of
determining whether or not the obligations of Borrower and Parent Guarantor
under this Agreement are being properly discharged and of preserving the
Administrative Agent's rights hereunder, and that the Administrative Agent's
failure to inspect or examine any matter shall not constitute a waiver of any of
the Lenders' rights hereunder. If the Administrative Agent or any other Lender
should inspect the Texas Project or any books and records, neither the
Administrative Agent nor any other Lender shall have any liability or obligation
to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third party arising out of such inspection
(other than any applicable obligation hereunder with respect to confidentiality)
and none of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third party shall be entitled to
rely upon such inspection or review. An inspection not followed by notice of
default shall not constitute a waiver of any Unmatured Default or Default then
existing, nor shall it constitute an acknowledgment or representation by the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender that there has been or will be
compliance with Laws or that the Texas Project is free from defective materials
or workmanship. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Lender owes any
duty of care to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third person to protect
against, or inform Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third person of the
existence of, negligent, faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction
of the Opryland Hotel Florida, the Texas Project or of any other Property.

                  (b)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall keep and
maintain, and Parent Guarantor shall cause the Subsidiary Guarantors and its
other Subsidiaries to maintain (either individually or on a consolidated basis
with Parent Guarantor), proper books of record and account in which entries in
conformity with Agreement Accounting Principles shall be made of all dealings
and transactions in relation to its businesses and activities. If a Default has
occurred that is continuing, Borrower and Parent Guarantor, upon the
Administrative Agent's request, shall turn over copies of any such records to
the Administrative Agent or its representatives.

Substantial Completion of the Texas Project to occur on or before June 30, 2004.

         6.11     Amount of Title Policy. From time to time, within 30 days of
Administrative Agent's request, Borrower shall cause the amount of the Mortgage
Title Insurance Policy to be increased to an amount equal to the sum of the
Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment and the Administrative Agent's then current
estimate of the aggregate amount of Secured Rate Management Obligations,
provided that the Administrative Agent shall make such request only if its
current estimate is at least $5,000,000.00 greater than such estimate as of the
Effective Date or as of the date of its prior request, if any, under this
Section 6.11.

                                       73

Capital Stock of Parent Guarantor or any such Subsidiary or any warrants or
options to purchase any such Stock, whether now or hereafter outstanding, or
make any other distribution in respect thereof, either directly or indirectly,

any such Subsidiary (such declarations, payments, setting apart, purchases,
redemptions, defeasances, retirements, acquisitions and distributions being
herein called "Restricted Payments," except that any Subsidiary may declare and
pay dividends to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor or, in
the case of any Subsidiary that is wholly owned by any other Subsidiary, to such

Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (or a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of a Subsidiary Guarantor) and (ii) Borrower shall not make or
declare any dividend, distribution or other payment to Parent Guarantor, or any

proceedings for the enforcement thereof are filed or commenced, then Borrower
and/or Parent Guarantor shall discharge the same within forty-five (45) days of
such filing or commencement; provided, however, that (i) Borrower or Parent
Guarantor shall have the right to contest in good faith and with due diligence
the validity of any such Lien or Claim upon furnishing to the Title Insurer such
security or indemnity as it may require to induce the Title Insurer to issue
endorsements to the Mortgage Title Insurance Policy insuring against all such
Claims, Liens or proceedings and (ii) the Lenders will not be required to make
any further Loans unless and until (A) any such Lien has been released or

such other security with respect to such Claim as may be acceptable to the
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion (and, at any time that such
Claims or Liens are in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate, satisfactory to
the Majority Lenders). In addition, as a condition to any such contest, the
Administrative Agent must be satisfied in its sole discretion (and at any time
that such Claims or Liens are in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate, the
Majority Lenders must be so satisfied), that: (1) any such Lien is being
contested, appealed or otherwise prosecuted with diligence and continuity, (2)
enforcement of such Lien shall be stayed pending such contest, appeal or other
proceeding, and (3) the Opryland Hotel Florida is secure and the priority of the
Mortgage remains unaffected.

to the extent such amounts are secured by cash collateral held by the issuer of
the applicable Letter of Credit) to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (before
restructuring charges to the extent reflected as such on Parent Guarantor's GAAP
income statement) to exceed the correlative ratio set forth below (Consolidated

Fiscal Quarter, Parent Guarantor will not permit the ratio of (i) Consolidated
EBITDA for the last full four Fiscal Quarters (after giving effect on a pro

such calculation, for the first four Fiscal Quarters ending after Substantial

thereof related to the Texas Project (by multiplying Consolidated EBITDA related
to the Texas Project for the period from Substantial Completion to the last day
of such Fiscal Quarter by a fraction, the numerator of which is 365 and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the period from Substantial
Completion through the last day of such Fiscal Quarter.

         6.26     Environmental Audits. Upon the occurrence of (a) a Default
that is continuing, (b) a material change in Environmental Laws or (c) an event
with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida which, in the reasonable
determination of the Administrative Agent, could result in an environmental
issue, question or concern, Parent Guarantor shall at the Administrative Agent's
election (i) cause to be performed through the employment of a consultant
acceptable to the Administrative Agent, an environmental assessment for the
purposes of confirming compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or (ii)
reimburse the Administrative Agent, on demand, for all reasonable costs, fees
and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with its
employment of a consultant to perform such an assessment.

         6.27     Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds. (a) Borrower and Parent
Guarantor hereby direct all insurers under policies of property damage, boiler
and machinery, rental loss, and rental value insurance and payors of any
condemnation claim or award relating to the Opryland Hotel Florida to pay all
Property Awards (net of the cost of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and
other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such Property
Awards) directly to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and
other Holders of Secured Obligations, and, in no case to Borrower or Parent
Guarantor. In the event of any loss or damage to any portion of the Opryland
Hotel Florida due to a casualty or condemnation event giving rise to a Property
Award ("Property Award Event"), so long as no Default has occurred that is
continuing, Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall have the sole right and authority
to settle any claim for the Property Award; provided, however, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right to participate in settlement
negotiations with respect to Property Award Events in connection with the
Opryland Hotel Florida which are reasonably likely to result in Property Awards
in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate. In the event of Borrower's or Parent
Guarantor's failure to settle any such claim for a Property Award within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the occurrence of the related Property Award
Event or if a Default has occurred that is continuing, the Administrative Agent
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to settle all claims for such
Property Award on behalf of Borrower or Parent Guarantor.

                  (b)      Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall promptly after the
occurrence of a Property Award Event with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida
commence and diligently pursue the repair, restoration or reconstruction of the
damaged portion of the Opryland Hotel Florida and the opening or reopening and
operation of the Opryland Hotel Florida ("Restoration"); provided, however, that
Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall have prepared and delivered to the
Administrative Agent a budget for such Restoration which is satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      In the event a Property Award with respect to the
Opryland Hotel Florida is paid to the Administrative Agent, such Property Award
shall be made available to Borrower or Parent Guarantor for the purpose of
Restoration or, in the case of rental loss, rental value and business
interruption insurance, to be applied to debt service upon the Obligations and
for other permitted expenditures with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida,
subject in each case to the following covenants and conditions:

                           (i)      No Default shall have occurred that is
continuing.

                           (ii)     As soon as practicable, but in no event
later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the related Property Award
Event (A) Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
written evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Lenders that, upon
completion of the Restoration, by the expenditure of the Property Award together
with any funds made available by Borrower or Parent Guarantor, the Opryland
Hotel Florida will be of at least substantially equal value, quality and
character as it was immediately prior to the Property Award Event, free and
clear of all Liens except the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent and
Customary Permitted Liens pertaining thereto, (B) the Restoration shall be
performed in compliance with all then applicable Laws and with good construction
scheduling and good construction practices and (C) Borrower or Parent Guarantor
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for approval preliminary plans and
specifications for the Restoration setting forth the construction schedule and
budget. Final plans and specifications shall be delivered to the Administrative
Agent for approval promptly upon their completion.

                           (iii)    If the Property Award is, in the
Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, insufficient to complete the
Restoration of the Opryland Hotel Florida, Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall
promptly deposit the amount of the insufficiency in a cash collateral account
(the "Restoration Account") in the name of Borrower or Parent Guarantor but
under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent and pledged to
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations
pursuant to agreements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Borrower or
Parent Guarantor may not use and, if applicable, the Administrative Agent shall
not, without the consent of the Majority Lenders, release, any Property Awards
until any such additional funds have been expended toward the Restoration and
the budget for such Restoration shall be "in balance" with the funds comprising
the Property Award sufficient to complete the Restoration. If at any time the
Restoration is "out of balance" with the budget and the remaining Property Award
is no longer sufficient to complete such Restoration, then Borrower or Parent
Guarantor may not use and, if applicable, the Administrative Agent shall not
without the consent of the Majority Lenders, further disburse, any portion of
the Property Award until such time as the Administrative Agent has determined,
that the remaining Property Award is sufficient to fully complete the
Restoration. For purposes hereof, the Restoration shall be deemed to be "in
balance" only at such time and from time to time, as the Administrative Agent
determines that the Property Award (and any additional amounts deposited in the
Restoration Account with respect to such Restoration in accordance with the
paragraph) equals or exceeds the aggregate amount of all unpaid costs, fees and
expenses necessary for all work in connection with the final completion of the
Restoration, including the costs of preparing plans and specifications, the
"hard" and "soft" costs of the construction of the base building and
Improvements.

                                       81
<PAGE>

                           (iv)     The Administrative Agent shall be reasonably
satisfied that the Opryland Hotel Florida, when fully restored, will constitute
premises suitable for their intended use of the same or better character and
quality as existed prior to the occurrence of the subject Property Award Event.

                           (v)      The Administrative Agent shall have received
and approved all documentation pertaining to the Restoration which has been
requested by the Administrative Agent, including the construction schedule,
construction budget, plans and specifications and any agreements between
Borrower or Parent Guarantor and any Persons who will perform services or
furnish labor or materials in connection with such Restoration (all such Persons
and agreements being subject to the Administrative Agent's, or as applicable,
Majority Lenders' approval).

                           (vi)     The Administrative Agent shall have received
and approved Lien waivers, contractor's statements and affidavits reflecting
that as of the date of each disbursement, there are (or immediately after
disbursement there will be) no mechanics' liens (subject to the right to contest
said Liens set forth in this Agreement) or other unpermitted Liens pertaining to
title affecting the damaged Property and the Administrative Agent shall have
received a date down endorsement to the Mortgage Title Insurance Policy
confirming the foregoing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

                           (vii)    Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall have
satisfied such other conditions and terms as the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably require (which shall be consistent with those that would be imposed
by a prudent institutional construction lender).

Upon the completion of the Restoration to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent, and after paying all reasonable costs and expenses
relating to the subject Property Award Event and related Restoration, the
Administrative Agent shall apply any unexpended balance of the subject Property
Award to prepayment of the Loans. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that no Default exists that is continuing and the
Property Award with respect to a Property Award Event is less than $3,000,000 in
the aggregate, the Administrative Agent shall pay the entire amount of such
proceeds to Borrower or Parent Guarantor promptly upon receipt thereof by the
Administrative Agent, which proceeds the Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall
apply for the purposes of Restoration.

                  (d)      Upon Borrower's or Parent Guarantor's failure to
satisfy the covenants and conditions set forth in clauses (b) and (c) above with
respect to a Property Award Event constituting loss or damage to all or
substantially all of the Opryland Hotel Florida, the Administrative Agent shall
have the right to apply the Property Award to the Secured Obligations in the
order of priority set forth in Section 2.12(b). If the amount of such Property
Award so applied is less than the Secured Obligations, then a Default shall be
deemed to have occurred and the Administrative Agent shall have all rights and
remedies set forth herein, in the Loan Documents, at law and in equity.

         6.28     The Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' Actions for Their
Own Protection Only. Borrower and Parent Guarantor acknowledge and agree that
the authority herein conferred upon the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
and any actions taken

                                       82
<PAGE>

by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the Opryland Hotel
Florida, to procure waivers or sworn statements, to approve contracts,
subcontracts and purchase orders, to approve plans and specifications, or
otherwise, will be exercised and taken by the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders for their own protection only and may not be relied upon by Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any third party for any purposes whatever; and neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Lenders shall be deemed to have assumed any
responsibility to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third party with respect to
any such action herein authorized or taken by the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders. Any review, investigation or inspection conducted by the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders, any architectural, engineering or other consultants retained
by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any Administrative Agent or
representative of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in order to verify
independently Borrower's or Parent Guarantor's satisfaction of any conditions
precedent to disbursements under this Agreement, Borrower's or Parent
Guarantor's performance of any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of
Borrower or Parent Guarantor under this Agreement, or the validity of any
representations and warranties made by Borrower or Parent Guarantor hereunder
(regardless of whether or not the party conducting such review, investigation or
inspection should have discovered that any of such conditions precedent were not
satisfied or that any such covenants, agreements or obligations were not
performed or that any such representations or warranties were not true), shall
not affect (or constitute a waiver by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
of) (i) any of Borrower's or Parent Guarantor's agreements, covenants,
representations and warranties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
or the Lender's reliance thereon or (ii) the Administrative Agent and Lenders'
reliance upon any certifications of Borrower or Parent Guarantor required under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any other facts,
information or reports furnished to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders by
Borrower or Parent Guarantor hereunder.

         6.29     Intentionally Reserved.

         6.30     Proceedings to Enjoin or Prevent Construction. If any
proceedings are filed seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare unlawful
the construction or the occupancy, maintenance or operation of the Opryland
Hotel Florida or the Texas Project or any portion thereof, Borrower and/or
Parent Guarantor shall at their sole expense (i) cause such proceedings to be
vigorously contested in good faith and (ii) in the event of an adverse ruling or
decision, prosecute all allowable appeals therefrom. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Borrower and/or Parent Guarantor shall resist the
entry or seek the stay of any temporary or permanent injunction that may be
entered and use its best efforts to bring about a favorable and speedy
disposition of all such proceedings.

         6.31     No Obligation to Monitor. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
the Lenders shall have any obligation to monitor or determine Borrower's or
Parent Guarantor's use or application of proceeds of Loans.

         6.32     Compliance with Agreements. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall comply in all material respects with its obligations under: (a) all Leases
affecting the Opryland Hotel Florida; (b) all agreements with Affiliates; (c)
any underlying covenants, conditions and restrictions of record with respect to
the Opryland

                                       83
<PAGE>

Hotel Florida; and (d) all other material contractual obligations relating to
the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Opryland Hotel Florida which are
not described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (c) above. In addition to the
foregoing Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall enforce its material rights and
remedies under the agreements described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (d)
above.

         6.33     Organizational Documents. Neither Borrower nor Parent
Guarantor shall allow any amendment, modification or other change to any of the
terms or provisions in any of their respective Organizational Documents (or any
Organizational Documents of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors) without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, which, in the case of any
amendment, modification or other change to the Organizational Documents of a
Subsidiary Guarantor that is not adverse to the interests of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         6.34     Leasing Provisions. Borrower shall not enter into, terminate,
cancel, amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify any Lease at the Opryland
Hotel Florida without the Administrative Agent's prior written approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that the tenant, if the
Administrative Agent requires it to do so, enters into a subordination,
non-disturbance and attornment agreement in the form required by the
Administrative Agent, subject to reasonable modifications requested by the
tenant; provided, that the Administrative Agent's approval shall not be required
(a) for any Lease (or any amendment, modification, supplement or termination
thereof) which is (i) with respect to demised premises within the restaurant,
retail, business center, spa and laundry premises identified as such on the
plans and specifications for the Opryland Hotel Florida, (ii) on market-rate
terms and conditions, and (iii) by its terms expressly subordinate to the
Mortgage (any such Lease, an "Ancillary Space Lease") or (b) to terminate any
Lease by reason of a default by the tenant thereunder, provided that such
termination is commercially reasonable. If requested by either Borrower, the
Administrative Agent shall, in its reasonable discretion, agree to enter into a
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement with the tenant under
any permitted Lease, in the form required by the Administrative Agent, subject
to reasonable modifications requested by the tenant.

         6.35     Ground Lease Covenants. (a) Borrower shall pay when due the
rent and all other sums and charges mentioned in, and payable under, the Florida
Hotel Ground Lease.

                  (b)      Borrower (i) shall timely perform and observe all of
the terms, covenants and conditions required to be performed and observed by it
as tenant under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease (including, without limitation,
all payment obligations), (ii) shall do all things necessary to preserve and to
keep unimpaired the Florida Hotel Ground Lease and its leasehold estate and
other rights thereunder; (iii) shall not waive, excuse or discharge any of the
obligations of the Florida Ground Lessor under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease
without the Majority Lenders' prior written consent in each instance; and (iv)
shall diligently and continuously enforce the obligations of the Florida Ground
Lessor, under the Florida Hotel Ground Leases.

                  (c)      Borrower shall not do, permit or suffer (i) any act,
event or omission which would be likely to result in a default or permit the
applicable lessor to terminate or

                                       84
<PAGE>

exercise any other remedy under the Ground Leases or (ii) any act, event or
omission which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would
constitute a default or permit the lessor to terminate or exercise any other
remedy under the Ground Leases.

                  (d)      Borrower shall not cancel, terminate, surrender,
modify or amend or in any way alter, surrender or permit the alteration of any
of the provisions of any of the Ground Leases or agree to any termination,
amendment, modification or surrender of any of the Ground Leases without the
Majority Lenders' prior written consent in each instance.

                  (e)      Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
copies of all default and other material notices received by Borrower from any
party under the Ground Leases, and of any notice received by Borrower from
either the Florida Ground Lessor or the Florida Master Lessor, of their
intention to terminate the Florida Hotel Ground Lease or the Florida Master
Lease, respectively, or to re-enter and take possession of any premises demised
by the Ground Leases, immediately and, in any event, within one (1) Business
Day, of delivery or receipt of any such notice, as the case may be.

                  (f)      Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Administrative
Agent copies of such information and evidence as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request concerning Borrower's due observance, performance and
compliance with the terms, covenants and conditions of the Ground Leases.

                  (g)      Borrower shall not consent to the subordination of
the Florida Hotel Ground Lease or the Florida Master Ground Lease to any
mortgage or other lease of the fee interest or any other leasehold interest in
any of the premises demised thereby.

                  (h)      To the extent it has the right to do so under the
terms of the Florida Ground Leases, Borrower, at its sole cost and expense,
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, within five (5) Business
Days after request, such documents, instruments or agreements as may be required
to permit the Administrative Agent to cure any default under the Florida Ground
Leases.

                  (i)      In the event of a default by Borrower in the
performance of any of its obligations under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease,
including, without limitation, any default in the payment of any sums payable
thereunder, then, in each and every case, the Administrative Agent may, with the
consent of the Majority Lenders, cause the default or defaults to be remedied
and otherwise exercise any and all rights of Borrower thereunder in the name of
and on behalf of Borrower. Borrower shall, on demand, reimburse the
Administrative Agent for all expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
curing any such default (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
disbursements), together with interest thereon computed at the Default Rate from
the date that such expense is incurred, to and including the date the same is
paid to the Administrative Agent.

                  (j)      Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written
notice of its intention to exercise each and every option, if any, to renew or
extend the term of the Florida Hotel Ground Lease, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration of the time to exercise such option under the terms
thereof. If required by the Majority Lenders, Borrower shall duly

                                       85
<PAGE>

exercise any renewal or extension option with respect to the Florida Hotel
Ground Lease. If Borrower intends to renew or extend the term of either of the
Florida Hotel Ground Lease, it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent with
the notice of such decision, a copy of the notice of renewal or extension
delivered to the Florida Ground Lessor, together with the terms and conditions
of such renewal or extension. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to
execute and deliver, for and in the name of Borrower, all instruments and
agreements necessary under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease or otherwise to cause
any renewal or extension of the Florida Hotel Ground Lease.

                  (k)      In the event that the Florida Hotel Ground Lease
shall be terminated by reason of a default beyond any applicable cure period
thereunder by Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall acquire from the
Florida Ground Lessor a novation or replacement ground lease, Borrower hereby
waives any right, title and interest in and to such novation ground lease and
the leasehold estate created thereby, together with all rights of redemption now
or hereafter operable under any law.

                  (l)      Borrower shall not elect to treat the Florida Hotel
Ground Lease as terminated, canceled or surrendered pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (including, without limitation, Section
365(h)(1) thereof) without the Majority Lenders' prior written consent in the
event of the bankruptcy of, or any similar proceedings with respect to, the
Florida Ground Lessor. Borrower shall, in the event of any bankruptcy or similar
proceedings with respect to the Florida Ground Lessor, reaffirm and ratify the
legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Florida Hotel
Ground Lease within the applicable time period therefor in such proceedings,
notwithstanding any rejection thereof by the Florida Ground Lessor or any
trustee, custodian or receiver.

                  (m)      Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice of the date on which Borrower shall
apply to any court or other governmental authority for authority and permission
to reject the Florida Hotel Ground Lease in the event that there shall be filed
by or against Borrower or Parent Guarantor any petition, action or proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other similar federal or state law now or
hereafter in effect and if Borrower determines to reject the Florida Hotel
Ground Lease. The Administrative Agent shall have the right, exercisable only
with the consent or at the direction of the Majority Lenders, but not the
obligation, to serve upon Borrower within such thirty (30) day period a notice
stating that (i) the Administrative Agent demands that Borrower assume and
assign the Florida Hotel Ground Lease to the Administrative Agent subject to and
in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) the Administrative Agent
covenants to cure or provide reasonably adequate assurance thereof with respect
to all defaults reasonably susceptible of being cured by the Administrative
Agent and of future performance under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease. If the
Administrative Agent serves upon Borrower the notice described above, Borrower
shall not seek to reject the Florida Hotel Ground Lease and shall comply with
the demand provided for clause (i) above within ten (10) days after the notice
shall have been given by the Administrative Agent.

                  (n)      During the continuance of a Default, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right, exercisable only with the consent or
at the direction of the Majority Lenders, but not the obligation, (i) to perform
and comply with all obligations of Borrower under the Florida

                                       86
<PAGE>

Hotel Ground Lease without regard to any grace period provided therein, (ii) to
do and take, without any obligation to do so, such action as the Administrative
Agent deems necessary or desirable to prevent or cure any default by Borrower
under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease, including, without limitation, any act,
deed, matter or thing whatsoever that Parent Guarantor may do in order to cure a
default under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease and (iii) to enter in and upon the
Opryland Hotel Florida or any part thereof to such extent and as often as the
Administrative Agent deems necessary or desirable in order to prevent or cure
any default of Borrower under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease. Borrower shall,
within five (5) days after written request is made therefor by the
Administrative Agent, execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent or to any
party designated by the Administrative Agent, such further instruments,
agreements, powers, assignments, conveyances or the like as may be reasonably
necessary to complete or perfect the interest, rights or powers of the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this paragraph or as may otherwise by required
by the Administrative Agent.

                  (o)      In the event of any arbitration under or pursuant to
any of the Florida Ground Leases in which the Administrative Agent elects to
participate, Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact (which appointment shall be deemed coupled
with an interest) to exercise, all right, title and interest of Borrower in
connection with such arbitration, including, without limitation, the right to
appoint arbitrators and to conduct arbitration proceedings on behalf of Borrower
and the Administrative Agent. All costs and expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with such arbitration and the settlement
thereof shall be borne solely by Borrower, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements. Nothing contained in this
paragraph shall obligate the Administrative Agent to participate in any such
arbitration.

                  (p)      The Administrative Agent shall have the right,
exercisable only with the consent or at the direction of the Majority Lenders,
but not the obligation, to proceed in respect of any claim, suit, action or
proceeding relating to the rejection of any of the Florida Ground Leases by the
relevant ground lessor as a result of bankruptcy or similar proceedings in
respect of such ground lessor, including, without limitation, the right to file

Administrative Agent notice of any material change in zoning and land use
ordinances and other Requirements of Law affecting the Opryland Hotel Florida

         6.38     Intentionally Reserved.

         6.39     Security Interest in Accounts; Certain Remedies. (a) Borrower
and Parent Guarantor covenant and agree not to maintain, and not to permit any
Property Manager to maintain with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida, any
bank accounts, investment accounts or other accounts other than the following
(collectively, the "Accounts"): the FF&E Reserve Account and the Restoration
Account (all of which shall be maintained by Borrower or Parent Guarantor, and
not by any Property Manager) and the other accounts identified in Schedule 6.39
hereto. To secure the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations,
Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby pledge and assign to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of itself and the Lenders and other Holders of Secured
Obligations all of Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's right, title and interest
in, and hereby grant to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of itself and
the Lenders and other Holders of the Secured Obligations a security interest in
and right of set-off against, and, without limiting the foregoing, the right
(exercisable only after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default)
to direct the holders of the Accounts to set-off against and immediately to turn
over to the Administrative Agent: (i) the Accounts; (ii) all cash, instruments,
securities, investments and other property from time to time transferred or
credited to, contained in or comprising the Accounts or any of them; (iii) all
statements, certificates, passbooks and

                                       88
<PAGE>

instruments representing the Accounts or any of them; (iv) any and all
substitutions or additions of or with respect to any of the foregoing; and (v)
any and all proceeds and products of any of the foregoing, whether now owned and
existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation (A)
interest, principal, dividends and other amounts or distributions received with
respect to any of the foregoing and (B) property received from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Account Collateral"). Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall cause any Property
Manager and the holders of the Accounts (the "Account Holders") to execute and
deliver notices and acknowledgments of the Administrative Agent's security
interest in the Accounts, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, prior to the Initial Funding Date or upon establishing
each Account, as applicable. Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree from time to
time, at their expense, to execute and deliver and promptly cause to be filed in
the appropriate public offices UCC financing statements and all further
instruments and documents, and to take all further action which Administrative
Agent may reasonably request and which are necessary or desirable in the opinion
of Administrative Agent or its counsel in order to create, preserve, perfect and
protect any security interests granted or purported to be granted hereby and
enable Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies
hereunder with respect to any Account Collateral. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
each hereby authorize Administrative Agent to file one or more financing or
continuation statements, and amendments thereto, and authorize Administrative
Agent to take all such further action and execute all such further documents and
instruments as may be reasonably necessary or desirable in order to create,
preserve, perfect and protect the security interest granted hereby, without the
signature of Borrower or Parent Guarantor where permitted by law. Whenever
applicable law requires the signature of Borrower or Parent Guarantor on a
document to be filed to preserve, perfect or protect the security interest
granted hereby, Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby appoint Administrative
Agent as their respective attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to
sign their names (or the names of any of them) on any such document. Borrower
and Parent Guarantor hereby agree that a photocopy or other reproduction of this
Agreement or any financing statement covering the Account Collateral or any part
thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law.
Neither Borrower nor Parent Guarantor shall further pledge, assign or grant a
security interest in the Account Collateral or any part thereof or permit any
other lien to attach thereto or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1
financing statement (except those naming Administrative Agent as secured party)
to be filed with respect thereto.

                  (b)      After the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default, the Administrative Agent shall, in addition to all remedies conferred
upon it and the Lenders by law and by the terms of the Loan Documents, have the
right, but not the obligation, without notice to Borrower or Parent Guarantor,
except as required by law, and at any time or from time to time to charge,
set-off and otherwise apply all or any portion of the Account Collateral against
the Secured Obligations and direct the disbursement thereof to the
Administrative Agent. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent
shall be irrevocably authorized to direct the Account Holders to withdraw or
transfer the Account Collateral from the Accounts and deposit or deliver the
same into an account of, or designated by, the Administrative Agent in its sole
and absolute discretion. The Account Holders shall be irrevocably authorized to
comply with any and all directions so given by the Administrative Agent.

                                       89
<PAGE>

                  (c)      In addition to (and not in limitation of) all other
rights or remedies granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant
to the Loan Documents, Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby grant the Account
Holders, their Affiliates and the Administrative Agent, in each case for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, a contractual right of
set-off against each of the Accounts and all of the Account Collateral.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.39, after a Default has occurred and during the continuance thereof, the
Administrative Agent may, at its sole and absolute discretion, (A) elect to
apply the Account Collateral in whole or in part to pay Opryland Hotel Florida
expenditures, (B) elect to have all or any portion of the Account Collateral
disbursed to a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction and
thereafter held and disbursed by such receiver in accordance with the
Administrative Agent's directions; and/or (C) elect to apply all or any part of
the Account Collateral to the Secured Obligations in such order and in such
manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole and absolute
discretion.

                  (e)      The Administrative Agent may also exercise in respect
of the Account Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for
herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured
party under the UCC, and the Administrative Agent may, without notice except as
specified below, sell the Account Collateral or any part thereof in one or more
parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent's offices
or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other
terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Borrower and
Parent Guarantor shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, at
Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's expense, execute and deliver, all such
instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts and
things, as may be reasonably necessary or, in the opinion of the Administrative
Agent or its counsel, advisable to make such sale of the Account Collateral or
any part thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law.
Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree that ten (10) days' notice of the time and
place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made
shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any sale of the Account Collateral regardless of notice of
sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or
private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and
place to which it was so adjourned.

                  (f)      BORROWER AND PARENT GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO NOTICE AND HEARING OF ANY KIND PRIOR TO THE EXERCISE BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OF ITS RIGHTS TO REPOSSESS THE ACCOUNT COLLATERAL WITHOUT
JUDICIAL PROCESS OR TO REPLEVY, ATTACH OR LEVY UPON SUCH COLLATERAL WITHOUT
PRIOR NOTICE OR HEARING.

                  (g)      Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.39, after a Default has occurred and during the continuance thereof,
the Administrative Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for and to obtain appointment of a receiver of

                                       90
<PAGE>

the Account Collateral as a matter of strict right, to take possession of the
Account Collateral, and to apply and disburse the same in accordance with this
Agreement.

                  (h)      To the full extent that they may lawfully so agree,
Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree that they shall not at any time plead, claim
or take the benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium
or redemption law now or hereafter in force to prevent or delay the enforcement
of this Agreement, the Loan Documents or the absolute sale of any portion of or
all of the Account Collateral or any portion of the Opryland Hotel Florida, or
the possession of any of the foregoing by any purchaser at any sale under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and Borrower and Parent Guarantor, each
for itself and all who may claim under Borrower and Parent Guarantor to the full
extent that Borrower or Parent Guarantor now or hereafter lawfully may do so,
hereby each waives the benefit of all such laws.

         6.40     Principal Places of Business; Names. Neither Borrower nor
Parent Guarantor will relocate its principal place of business, chief executive
office, place where it maintains its records, or residence, or change its name
or the name under which it does business or change its jurisdiction of formation
without, in each case, giving the Administrative Agent at least thirty (30) days
advance written notice thereof or without taking such steps as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably require (including, without limitation,
executing additional Financing Statements) to maintain the perfection of all
Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral.

         6.41     Documents of Further Assurance. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall, from time to time, upon the Administrative Agent's request, promptly
execute, deliver, record and furnish such documents as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably deem necessary to (a) perfect and maintain perfected as valid
Liens upon the Collateral the Liens contemplated by this Agreement, (b) correct
any mistakes of a typographical nature which may be contained herein or in any
of the Loan Documents, (c) replace any Notes or other Loan Documents that may
have been misplaced, lost or destroyed (as evidenced by an affidavit to such
effect from the holder thereof), (d) acknowledge and confirm the unpaid
principal balance of and interest on the Loans and state whether Borrower or
Parent Guarantor claim any off-set or defense with respect thereto and (e)
consummate fully the transaction contemplated under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

         6.42     Wetlands. Neither Borrower nor Parent Guarantor shall cause or
permit any construction or other activities at the Opryland Hotel Florida that
affect any wetlands areas except to the extent permitted under Permits or other
Governmental Approvals issued by applicable Government Authorities.

         8.1      Acceleration.

                  (a)      If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
with respect to Borrower, Parent Guarantor, any Property Manager or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, the Revolving Loan Commitment and the obligations of the
Lenders to issue Letters of Credit and make Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, and Borrower shall immediately pay to the
Administrative Agent an additional amount of cash, to be held as cash collateral
by Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Banks as security for
Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's reimbursement obligations in respect of all
Letters of Credit then outstanding, which amount (the "Letter of Credit
Collateral Amount") shall be equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of such
Letters of Credit. If any other Default occurs, the Administrative Agent shall
upon the direction of, and may, with the consent of Majority Lenders, take any
or all of the following actions: (i) terminate or suspend the Revolving Loan
Commitment and the obligations of the Lenders to issue Letters of Credit and

Obligations to be due and payable, whereupon the Obligations, including, without
limitation, the Letter of Credit Collateral Amount, shall become immediately due
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of
which Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby expressly waive or (iii) terminate
any Letter of Credit which may be terminated in accordance with its terms.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent may, and, at the request of
the Majority Lenders shall, at any time or from time to time while any Default
exists and is continuing apply any funds deposited in any of the Accounts to the
payment of the Secured Obligations and any other amounts as shall from time to
time have become due and payable by Borrower to the Lenders under the Loan
Documents.

                  (c)      At any time while any Default is continuing, neither
Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through Borrower shall have any
right to withdraw any of the funds held in any Account. After all of the
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Revolving Loan
Commitment has been terminated, any funds remaining in the Accounts shall be
returned by the Administrative Agent to Borrower or paid to whomever may be
legally entitled thereto at such time.

                                       95

hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to Borrower or Parent Guarantor) and before any
judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been
obtained or entered, the Majority Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so
direct, then the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to Borrower, rescind and
annul such acceleration and/or termination.

         8.2      All Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Default, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have all rights and
remedies set forth herein, in the Loan Documents, at law and in equity and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to pursue one or more of such rights and remedies concurrently or
successively, it being the intent hereof that all such rights and remedies shall
be cumulative, and that no remedy shall be to the exclusion of any other.

         8.3      Intentionally Reserved.

         8.4      Enforcement. Borrower and Parent Guarantor each acknowledge
that in the event Borrower or Parent Guarantor fails to perform, observe or
discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders; therefore, Borrower and Parent Guarantor
each agree that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to
temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity
of proving actual damages.

         8.5      Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or
the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an
acquiescence therein, and the making of an Advance notwithstanding the existence
of a Default or the inability of Borrower or Parent Guarantor to satisfy the
conditions precedent to such Advance shall not constitute any waiver or
acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing
signed by the Administrative Agent, and then only to the extent in such writing
specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law
afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1      Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made herein and all obligations, covenants and agreements of Borrower
and Parent Guarantor in respect of taxes, indemnification and expense
reimbursement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, the making and repayment of the Advances and the
termination of this Agreement and shall not be

                                       96
<PAGE>

limited in any way by the passage of time or occurrence of any event and shall
expressly cover time periods when the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders
may have come into possession or control of any Property of Borrower or Parent
Guarantor.

         9.2      Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to any Borrower or Parent Guarantor in violation of any limitation or
prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation unless the same has
resulted from the failure of such Lender to comply with any requirements imposed
upon such Lender by applicable Law.

         9.3      Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.4      Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
among Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
relating to the subject matter hereof.

         9.5      Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder. Borrower and Parent Guarantor are jointly and
severally liable and obligated for each other's obligations hereunder. This
Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors
and assigns, provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that the
Joint Book Running Managers, Co-Lead Arrangers and Syndication Agent (each, an
Initial Lender Affiliate, and collectively, the "Initial Lender Affiliates")
shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10, 10.10, 10.18
and 10.20 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right
to enforce such provisions on their own behalf and in their own names to the
same extent as if each were a party to this Agreement.

         9.6      Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any costs and out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent (but excluding overhead and internal costs) in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, review,
amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents, in connection
with disbursements hereunder and otherwise with respect to the Opryland Hotel
Florida. Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree to reimburse the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders for any costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, but excluding internal administrative overhead except for
legal fees hereafter referred to in this sentence) paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, which

                                       97
<PAGE>

attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents in the
event of a Default. Expenses required to be reimbursed by Borrower and Parent
Guarantor under this Section 9.6 include, without limitation, the cost and
expense of obtaining an Appraisal of the Opryland Hotel Florida, provided that
so long as no Default shall exist that is continuing Borrower and Parent
Guarantor shall not be required to pay for an Appraisal other than (i) the
initial Appraisal by Cushman & Wakefield obtained by the Administrative Agent
prior to the Effective Date and (ii) a single further Appraisal of the Opryland
Hotel Florida which the Administrative Agent may commission in its sole
discretion.

                  (b)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby further agree to
indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Initial Lender Affiliates, each Lender,
their respective Affiliates, and each of their agents, shareholders, directors,
officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties,
judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses
of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent,
any Initial Lender Affiliate, any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto)
which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or
indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Advance
hereunder except to the extent that they are determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking
indemnification. The obligations of Borrower and Parent Guarantor under this
Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         9.7      Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent
with sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to
each of the Lenders.

         9.8      Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

         9.9      Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10     Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand
shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the Administrative Agent,
any Initial Lender Affiliate, or any Lender shall have any fiduciary
responsibilities to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor. None
of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender Affiliate, or any Lender
undertakes any responsibility to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary
Guarantor to review or inform Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary
Guarantor of any matter in connection with any phase of Borrower's business or
operations.

                                       98
<PAGE>

Borrower agrees that none of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender
Affiliate, or any Lender shall have liability to Borrower (whether sounding in
tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by Borrower in connection with,
arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the
relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which
recovery is sought. None of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender
Affiliate, or any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and Borrower
hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect or
consequential damages suffered by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary
Guarantor in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

         9.11     Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section
9.11(b) and Section 12.4, each Lender agrees that it will use its reasonable
efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of Parent Guarantor (other
than to its employees, officers, directors, auditors, advisors or counsel or to
another Lender, provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.11 to the same extent as such Lender) any confidential information
with respect to Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries which is now or in
the future furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become
generally available to the public other than by virtue of a breach of this
Section by such Lender, (b) to the extent such information was legally in
possession of such Lender prior to its receipt from or on behalf of Parent
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries and was from a source not known to such
Lender to be (x) bound by a confidentiality agreement with Parent Guarantor or
(y) otherwise prohibited from transmitting such information to such Lender by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, (c) such information becomes
available to such Lender from a source other than Parent Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries and such source is not known to such Lender to be (x) bound by a
confidentiality agreement with Parent Guarantor or (y) otherwise prohibited from
transmitting such information to such Lender by a contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation, (d) as may be required or reasonably appropriate in any
report, statement or testimony submitted to, or in response to a request from,
any municipal, state or Federal governmental or regulatory body having or
claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the NAIC or similar organizations
(whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (e) as may be
required or reasonably appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena or in
connection with any litigation, (f) in order to comply with any Requirements of
Law applicable to such Lender, (g) to the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, (h) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparties' professional advisors; provided
that such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual
counterparty agrees in writing to keep such information confidential to the same
extent required of the Lenders hereunder, and (i) to any prospective or actual
transferee or participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or
participation of any of the Notes or Revolving Loan Commitment or any interest
therein by such Lender, provided that such prospective transferee shall have
agreed to be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.11.

                                       99
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each
Lender may, but only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or the participation of such Lender
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, share with any of its
affiliates any information related to Parent Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any nonpublic customer information
regarding the creditworthiness of Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries,
provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.11 to
the same extent as such Lender).

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
confidential information shall not include, and the Administrative Agent and
each Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with
respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to the Administrative Agent or such Lender
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with respect to
any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning
the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other
information, this sentence shall apply only to such portions of the document or
similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Loan and
transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.12     Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not
relying on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the
Advances provided for herein.

         9.13     Disclosure. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and each Lender hereby
(i) acknowledge and agree that Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown Inc. and/or their respective Affiliates from time to time may
hold investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and any of their Affiliates, and (ii) waive any
liability of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
Inc. and/or their respective Affiliates to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Lender, respectively, arising out of or resulting from such investments, loans
or relationships.

         9.14     Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in
favor of Borrower or Parent Guarantor, any other party or against or in payment
of any or all of the Secured Obligations. To the extent that Borrower or Parent
Guarantor makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
or any such Person receives payment from the proceeds of the Collateral or
exercises its rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of
such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to
a trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such recovery, the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens,
right and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had
not occurred.

         9.15     Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
the successors and permitted assigns of the Lenders. The rights hereunder of
Borrower and Parent Guarantor and any interest therein, may not be assigned
without the written consent of all Lenders, which may be granted or withheld in
the sole discretion of each.

         9.16     Inconsistencies. This Agreement and each of the other Loan
Documents shall be construed to the extent reasonable to be consistent one with
the other, but to the extent that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are
actually inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document,
this Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the existence of (and the Lenders' review of), the Organizational
Documents shall not be deemed to be an approval by the Administrative Agent or
the Lenders of any of the actions that may be permitted to be taken by Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any other Person thereunder to the extent such actions
violate the terms hereof. In addition to the foregoing, none of the terms or
provisions hereof shall be deemed to be waived or modified by virtue of the fact
that such terms and provisions conflict with, or contradict, any of the terms
and provisions of the Organizational Documents.

         9.17     Disclaimer by Lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be liable to any contractor,
subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer, tenant or other party for
services performed or materials supplied in connection with any work performed
at the Opryland Hotel Florida or any other Property. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor the Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be liable for any
debts or claims accruing in favor of any such parties against Borrower, Parent
Guarantor or others or against any Property. Neither Borrower nor Parent
Guarantor shall be an agent of either the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or
any Initial Lender Affiliate for any purposes and neither the Lenders nor the
Administrative Agent nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be deemed partners
or joint venturers with Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any other Person. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor the Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall
be deemed to be in privity of contract with any contractor or provider of
services to the Opryland Hotel Florida, nor shall any payment of funds directly
to a contractor or subcontractor or provider of services be deemed to create any
third party beneficiary status or recognition of same by either the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any Initial Lender Affiliate, and
Borrower and Parent Guarantor each agree to hold the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and the Initial Lender Affiliates harmless from any of the damages and
expenses resulting from such a construction of the relationship of the parties
or any assertion thereof.

         9.18     Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of each and
every term and provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         9.19     Protective Advances. The Administrative Agent may from time to
time, before or after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default,
subject to the prior written approval of the Majority Lenders, make such
disbursements and advances pursuant to the Loan Documents (which disbursements
and advances shall be deemed to be "Loans" made hereunder) which the
Administrative Agent, in its

                                      101
<PAGE>

reasonable discretion, deems necessary or desirable to preserve or protect the
Collateral or any portion thereof or to enhance the likelihood or maximize the
amount of repayment of the Secured Obligations ("Protective Advances"). The
Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower, Parent Guarantor and each Lender in
writing of each such Protective Advance, which notice (each a "Protective
Advance Notice") shall include a description of the purpose of such Protective
Advance, the aggregate amount of such Protective Advance, each Lender's Pro Rata
Share thereof and the date each Lender shall be required to pay its Pro Rata
Share of the Protective Advance (the "Protective Advance Date"), which
Protective Advance Date shall be not less than two (2) Business Days after
delivery of the Protective Advance Notice. Each Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Protective Advance on the
Protective Advance Date in the manner set forth herein for a funding of an
Advance. Borrower or Parent Guarantor agree to pay the Administrative Agent,
upon demand, the principal amount of all outstanding Protective Advances,
together with interest thereon at the rate set forth in Section 2.11 applicable
in the event of a Default. If Borrower or Parent Guarantor fail to make payment
in respect of any Protective Advance within three (3) Business Days after the
date Borrower or Parent Guarantor receive written demand therefor from the
Administrative Agent, such failure shall constitute a Default. All outstanding
principal of, and interest on, Protective Advances shall constitute Secured
Obligations secured by the Collateral until paid in full by Borrower or Parent
Guarantor. Upon the making of a Protective Advance, the Administrative Agent
shall be subrogated to any and all rights, equal or superior titles, liens and
equities, owned or claimed by any owner or holder of said outstanding liens,
charges and indebtedness, however remote, regardless of whether said liens,
charges and indebtedness are acquired by assignment or have been released of
record by the holder thereof upon payment.

                                    ARTICLE X

                    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

         10.1     Appointment. The Lenders hereby designate Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas as Administrative Agent to act as specified herein and in the
other Loan Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder
of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to
authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other instruments
and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to
perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may
perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its respective officers,
directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

         10.2     Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement
and in the other Loan Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
respective officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan
Documents or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined

                                      102
<PAGE>

by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).
The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the
holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon
the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

         10.3     Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. (a)
Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and the holder of each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and
shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial
condition and affairs of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary
Guarantors in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and
the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of such Persons and, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at
any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any other Loan Document
or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection
herewith or therewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the financial condition of
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or be required to make
any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the
financial condition of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors
or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent does not represent, warrant
or guaranty to the Lenders the performance of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, any architect, any project managers, any contractor,
subcontractor or provider of materials or services in connection with the
construction of the Texas Project and Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall remain
solely responsible for all aspects of the Texas Project, including but not
limited to the quality and suitability of the plans and specifications, the
supervision of the work of construction, the qualifications, financial condition
and performance of all architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers, consultants and property managers and the accuracy of all
applications for payment.

         10.4     Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the Majority Lenders with
respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Majority Lenders;
and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason
of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or

                                      103
<PAGE>

holder of any Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or
refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance
with the instructions of the Majority Lenders.

         10.5     Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution,
notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message,
cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent
or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent in good faith believed to be
the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder,
upon advice of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent (which may be
counsel for Borrower or Parent Guarantor).

         10.6     Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower or Parent Guarantor, the Lenders will
reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent, in proportion to their
respective "percentages" as used in determining the Majority Lenders, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind
or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its respective duties hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

         10.7     The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. With
respect to its obligation to make Loans, or issue or participate in Letters of
Credit, under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and
powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same rights and
powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the
term "Lenders," "Majority Lenders," "holders of Notes" or any similar terms
shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
banking, investment banking, trust or other business with Borrower, Parent
Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Affiliate of any such Person as if
it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from any such Person for services in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and otherwise without having to account for
the same to the Lenders.

         10.8     Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a
written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case
may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the
case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

                                      104
<PAGE>

         10.9     Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The
Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and
duties hereunder and/or under the other Loan Documents at any time by giving 15
Business Days' prior written notice to Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the
Lenders. Any such resignation by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall also
constitute its resignation as the Swingline Lender, if applicable, in which case
the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make any additional Swingline
Loans hereunder and shall maintain all of its rights as the Swingline Lender
with respect to Swingline Loans made by it prior to the date of such
resignation. Such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a
successor Administrative Agent pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as
otherwise provided below. Furthermore, Administrative Agent may be removed by
the Majority Lenders in the event that Administrative Agent committed a willful
breach of, or was grossly negligent in the performance of, its material
obligations hereunder (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final, non-appealable decision).

                  (b)      Upon any such notice of resignation by the
Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall appoint a successor
Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial Lender or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Majority Lenders (it being understood
and agreed that any Lender is deemed to be acceptable to the Majority Lenders),
provided that, if a Default or an Unmatured Default exists at the time of such
resignation, the Majority Lenders shall appoint such successor Administrative
Agent.

                  (c)      If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have
been so appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent,
with the consent of Borrower and Parent Guarantor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if
any, as Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Majority Lenders, as the case may be,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                  (d)      If no successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above by the 30th Business Day after the
date such notice of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent's resignation shall become effective and the Majority
Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder and/or under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Majority Lenders, as the case may be, appoint
a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

         10.10    Other Agents. None of the Co-Lead Arrangers nor the Joint Book
Running Managers nor the Syndication Agent shall have any liabilities or
obligations hereunder in their respective capacities as such.

         10.11    Lender Default. If any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") fails to
fund its Pro Rata Share of any Advance on or before the time required pursuant
to this Agreement, or fails to fund its Pro Rata Share of any amount due under
Section 10.14(d) or the last sentence of Section 10.12 on or before the time
required thereunder or fails to pay the Administrative Agent, within twenty (20)
days of demand (which demand shall be accompanied by invoices or other
reasonable back up information demonstrating the

                                      105
<PAGE>

amount owed), such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any out-of-pocket costs, expenses
or disbursements incurred or made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (the aggregate amount which the Defaulting Lender fails
to pay or fund is herein referred to as the "Default Amount"; and each such
failure by a Lender is referred to herein as a "Lender Default"), then, in
addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to the Non-Defaulting
Lenders at law and in equity:

                  (a)      The Defaulting Lender's right to participate in the
administration of the Obligations and the Loan Documents, including without
limitation, any rights to vote upon, consent to or direct any action of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall be suspended and such rights shall not
be reinstated unless and until such default is cured, provided, however, that if
the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall
continue to have all rights provided for in this Agreement and the Loan
Agreement with respect to the administration of the Loans, unless the Majority
Lenders vote to remove and replace the Administrative Agent, in which event the
Majority Lenders shall notify the Administrative Agent, Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and the other Lenders of the identity of the successor Administrative
Agent so chosen by the Majority Lenders and such successor Administrative Agent
shall assume all the rights and duties of Administrative Agent hereunder as of
the date such notice is given;

                  (b)      If and to the extent the Default Amount includes an
amount which, if advanced by the Defaulting Lender, would be applied to
interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders under the Loan Documents
(such portion of the Default Amount is herein referred to as the "Lender Payment
Portion"), the Administrative Agent may, and shall upon the direction of the
Majority Lenders, treat as advanced by the Defaulting Lender to itself (with a
corresponding automatic increase in the Defaulting Lender's Loan balance, and
without necessity for executing any further documents) the Lender Payment
Portion, whereupon a corresponding offset shall be made against the Default
Amount;

                  (c)      If and to the extent any Default Amount remains
(after taking into account the deemed advance and application made under Section
10.11(b) above), any or all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders shall be entitled (but
shall not be obligated) to fund all or part of the remaining Default Amount (the
"Funded Default Amount"), and collect from the Defaulting Lender or from amounts
otherwise payable to the Defaulting Lender interest at the Default Rate on the
Funded Default Amount for the period from the date on which the payment was due
until the date on which payment is made (less any interest actually paid by
Borrower on the Funded Default Amount from time to time, which payments shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent pari passu to the Non-Defaulting Lenders
which shall have so funded the Funded Default Amount);

                  (d)      So long as any Default Amount remains outstanding,
the Defaulting Lender's interest in the Obligations and the Loan Documents and
proceeds thereof shall be subordinated to the interest of the Non-Defaulting
Lenders in the Obligations and the Loan Documents in the manner set forth in
Section 10.11(e) below, without necessity for executing any further documents,
provided that such Defaulting Lender's interest in the Obligations and the Loan
Documents and the proceeds thereof shall no longer be so subordinated if the
Default Amount (and all interest which has accrued pursuant to Section 10.11(c)
above) shall be repaid

                                      106
<PAGE>

(or, if not funded by the Non-Defaulting Lenders, advanced to the Administrative
Agent for disbursement in accordance with this Agreement) in full;

                  (e)      To achieve such subordination, that portion of all
amounts received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations which
would otherwise be payable to the Defaulting Lender on account of its interest
in the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:

                           (i)      first to pay pari passu to the
Non-Defaulting Lenders the Funded Default Amount, together with interest thereon
payable under Section 10.11(c) above, until the Funded Default Amount and all
interest thereon has been repaid in full (with collections from Borrower being
deemed earned by the Defaulting Lender to the extent of its Pro Rata Share
thereof and paid over to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application first to
interest (in accordance with Section 10.13(c) above and then to principal upon
the Funded Default Amount); then

                           (ii)     second, the remainder, if any, shall be
deemed earned by the Defaulting Lender to the extent of its Pro Rata Share
thereof and held in escrow by the Administrative Agent for distribution as
follows:

                                    (A)      upon payment in full of all the
Secured Obligations, without foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (or other
similar disposition of the Collateral) or other enforcement proceedings with
respect to the Secured Obligations, the funds held in escrow shall be promptly
disbursed to the Defaulting Lender; and

                                    (B)      upon completion of any foreclosure,
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (or other similar disposition of the Collateral) or
other enforcement proceedings with respect to the Secured Obligations the funds
held in trust shall be promptly disbursed as follows:

                                    (1)      first, to the Non-Defaulting
                                             Lenders and their Affiliates which
                                             are Holders of Secured Obligations
                                             pari passu in the amount of all
                                             Secured Obligations which have not
                                             been paid and satisfied by the
                                             foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of
                                             foreclosure (or other similar
                                             disposition of the Collateral) or
                                             other enforcement proceedings with
                                             respect to the Secured Obligations
                                             in order to compensate the
                                             Non-Defaulting Lenders for any
                                             failure to recover the full amount
                                             of the Secured Obligations upon
                                             completion of any such disposition
                                             of the Collateral or other
                                             enforcement action; and

                                    (2)      second, any remaining funds shall
                                             be disbursed to the Defaulting
                                             Lender.

                  (f)      Each Non-Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but
not the obligation, in its sole discretion, to acquire such Defaulting Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the Advances and the Obligations, together with the Funded
Default Amount, in which case the following provisions shall apply:

                                      107
<PAGE>

                           (i)      If more than one Non-Defaulting Lender
exercises such right, each such Non-Defaulting Lender shall have the right to
acquire (in proportion to such acquiring Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares (or
upon agreement thereof, any other proportion)) the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata
Share in the Advances and the Obligations, together with all of the Funded
Default Amount (being deemed a portion of the Obligations advanced by the
Non-Defaulting Lenders which funded the Funded Default Amount). Such right to
purchase shall be exercised by written notice from the applicable Non-Defaulting
Lender(s) electing to exercise such right to the Defaulting Lender and the
Administrative Agent (an "Exercise Notice"), copies of which shall also be sent
concurrently to the other Lenders. The Exercise Notice shall specify (A) the
Purchase Price for the Pro Rata Share of the Defaulting Lender, determined in
accordance with Section 10.11(f)(ii) below, and (B) the date on which such
purchase is to occur, which shall be any Business Day which is not less than
fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Exercise Notice is given, provided
that if such Defaulting Lender shall have cured its default in full (including
all interest and other amounts due in connection therewith) to the satisfaction
of the Administrative Agent within said fifteen (15) day period, then the
Exercise Notice shall be of no further effect and the applicable Non-Defaulting
Lenders shall no longer have a right to purchase such Defaulting Lender's Pro
Rate Share or the Funded Default Amount. Upon any such purchase of the Pro Rata
Share of a Defaulting Lender and as of the date of such purchase (the "Purchase
Date"), (X) the Non-Defaulting Lenders purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro
Rata Share shall also purchase the Funded Default Amount in equivalent
proportions from the Non-Defaulting Lenders which funded the same, for a
purchase price equal to par plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon under the
provisions of Section 10.11(c) ("Default Amount Accrued Interest"), (Y) the
Non-Defaulting Lenders purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share shall
promptly advance to the Administrative Agent their proportionate shares of any
unfunded portion of the Default Amount, and (Z) the Defaulting Lender's interest
in the Loans and the Obligations, and its rights hereunder as a Lender arising
from and after the Purchase Date (but not its rights and liabilities in respect
thereof or under the Loan Documents or this Agreement for obligations,
indemnities and other matters arising or matters occurring before the Purchase
Date) shall terminate on the Purchase Date, and the Defaulting Lender shall
promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer
such interest. Without in any manner limiting the remedies of the Lenders, the
obligations of a Defaulting Lender to sell and assign its Pro Rata Share under
this Section 10.11(f) shall be specifically enforceable by the Administrative
Agent and/or the other Lenders, by an action brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction for such purpose, it being acknowledged and agreed that, in light
of the disruption in the administration of the Advances and the other terms of
the Loan Documents that a Defaulting Lender may cause, damages and other
remedies at law are not adequate.

                           (ii)     The purchase price for the Pro Rata Share of
the Advances and the Obligations of a Defaulting Lender (the "Purchase Price")
shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the sum of all of the Defaulting
Lender's Advances (including advances for Protective Advances) under the Loans
outstanding as of the Purchase Date, less the Default Amount Accrued Interest
and costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
directly as a result of the Defaulting Lender's default hereunder, court costs
and the fees and expenses of attorneys, paralegals, accountants and other
similar advisors, and if such amounts are not then known, there shall be
deducted from the Purchase Price and placed into escrow with the Administrative
Agent an amount equal to 200% of the Administrative Agent's reasonable estimate
of such costs, to be held for disbursement to pay such costs as incurred, with
any

                                      108
<PAGE>

remainder being returned to the Defaulting Lender upon payment in full of all
the Secured Obligations. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Lenders
purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share are entitled to do so at the
price set forth in this Section 10.11(f)(ii) due to the risk that the
Obligations and Collateral may further decline in value after such purchase as a
result of the Defaulting Lender's default.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to waive, diminish or
limit, or prevent or stop any Lender from exercising or enforcing, any rights or
remedies which may be available at law or in equity as a result of or in
connection with any default under this Agreement by a Lender. In addition, no
Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender if such Lender refuses to fund
its Pro Rata Share of any Advance being made after any bankruptcy-related
Default under Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 of this Agreement due to the lack of
bankruptcy court approval for such Advance.

         10.12    Authority. The Administrative Agent, as described herein,
shall have all rights with respect to collection and administration of the
Obligations, the security therefor and the exercise of remedies with respect
thereto, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein. The Lenders
agree that the Administrative Agent shall make all determinations as to whether
to grant or withhold approvals under the Loan Documents and as to compliance
with the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents, except to the extent
otherwise expressly set forth therein or herein. The Administrative Agent will
simultaneously deliver to the Lenders copies of any default notices sent to
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the terms of the
Loan Documents and will promptly provide to the Lenders copies of any material
notices received from Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor,
including without limitation notices received under Section 6.18 (and copies of
the documents received by the Administrative Agent thereunder). The
Administrative Agent shall not, however, take the following actions without
first obtaining the consent of requisite Lenders, as set forth below:

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent shall not, without first
obtaining the consent of the Unanimous Lenders, take any of the following
actions:

                           (i)      amend the interest rate, any date on which
interest is due, or the Maturity Date set forth in the Loan Documents;

                           (ii)     release any collateral for the Secured
Obligations, or release any guaranty, indemnity agreement or any Person
(including, without limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantor) with respect to any
such guaranty or indemnity agreement (except for the release of any Subsidiary
Guarantor from the Guaranty upon consummation of an Asset Sale with respect to
such Subsidiary Guarantor or substantially all of its assets and except for
releases otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents upon
satisfaction of all applicable conditions specified therein), or waive or
release any indemnity obligations of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any guarantor
(including, without limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantor) to the Lenders under
the Loan Documents;

                                      109
<PAGE>

                           (iii)    increase the amount of the Revolving Loan
Commitment, except with respect to any increase in the Revolving Loan Commitment
as may occur from time to time pursuant to Section 2.19 hereof;

                           (iv)     forgive or reduce any principal, interest or
fees due under the Obligations or extend the time for payment of any such
principal, interest or fees;

                           (v)      consent to the further encumbrance or
hypothecation of all or any portion of the Opryland Hotel Florida or any other
Collateral except to the extent expressly permitted under the Loan Documents;

                           (vi)     modify, waive or consent to any assignment
in violation of Section 12.1(i);

                           (vii)    change the Pro Rata Share of any Lender,
except in connection with a transfer of a Lender's interest permitted under the
Loan Agreement or in connection with an increase in the Revolving Loan
Commitment pursuant to Section 2.19 hereof;

                           (viii)   modify or amend this Section 10.12; or

                           (ix)     modify or amend the definition of "Unanimous
Lenders" or "Majority Lenders" herein.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent shall not, without first
obtaining the consent of the Majority Lenders, take any of the following
actions:

                           (i)      exercise (or refrain from exercising) rights
or remedies with respect to any Default, including any action with respect to
the exercise of remedies or the realization, operation or disposition of any
Collateral, provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may deliver
consents contemplated by the Loan Documents and waivers of provisions (other
than material provisions, including without limitation, any of the provisions
specifically enumerated in Section 7.3 hereof) of the Loan Documents;

                           (ii)     amend, supplement or otherwise modify in any
material respect any of the Loan Documents or execute a written waiver of any
material provision of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any of
the provisions specifically enumerated in Section 7.3 hereof), provided that
such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver does not require the consent
of all the Lenders under Section 10.12(a) above;

                           (iii)    consent to the transfer by Borrower or
Parent Guarantor of all or any part of its direct or indirect interest in the
Opryland Hotel Florida or any other Collateral, except to the extent expressly
permitted under the Loan Documents;

                           (iv)     consent to any Change of Control;

                           (v)      agree to cause an additional or updated
Appraisal to be ordered at the Lenders' expense;

                                      110
<PAGE>

                           (vi)     modify, amend or waive any requirement in
Section 6.25; or

                           (vii)    consent to or take action with respect to
any matter specified herein to require the consent or approval of the Majority
Lenders.

                  (c)      The consent of the Swingline Lender shall be required
for any action, waiver, consent, amendment or other agreement which would have
the effect of altering any of the Swingline Lender's rights or obligations with
respect to Swingline Loans.

                  (d)      The consent of each Issuing Bank shall be required
for any action, waiver, consent, amendment or other agreement which would have
the effect of altering any provision of Sections 2.20 through 2.20.4 or altering
its rights or obligations with respect to Letters of Credit.

         As to any matters which are subject to the consent of any or all of the
Lenders, as set forth above or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent shall not be permitted or required to exercise any discretion or to take
any action except upon the receipt of the written consent or instruction with
respect to such action by the requisite Lenders, which written consent or
instruction shall be binding upon the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that the Lenders'
right to consent to or disapprove any particular matter shall be limited to the
extent that the Lenders' or Administrative Agent's rights to consent to or
disapprove of such matter are limited in the Loan Documents.

         As to any matter which is subject to a vote of the Lenders hereunder,
any of the Lenders may require the Administrative Agent to initiate such a vote.
In such event, the Administrative Agent shall conduct a vote in accordance with
the provisions of the next paragraph. The Administrative Agent shall be bound by
the results of such vote, so long as the action voted in favor of is permissible
under the Loan Documents and under applicable law, and subject to the obligation
of each Lender to contribute its Pro Rata Share of all expenses and liabilities
incurred in connection therewith as more fully set forth below.

         All communications from the Administrative Agent to the Lenders
requesting the Lenders' approval (i) shall be given in the form of a written
notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter
as to which such approval is requested and (iii) shall include, if appropriate,
the recommendation of the Administrative Agent, if any.

         Subject to the foregoing limitations, each Lender hereby appoints and
constitutes the Administrative Agent as its agent with full power and authority
to exercise on behalf of such Lender any and all rights and remedies which such
Lender may have with respect to, and to the extent necessary under applicable
law for, the enforcement of the Loan Documents, including the right to exercise,
or to refrain from exercising, any and all remedies afforded to such Lender by
the Loan Documents or which such Lender may have as a matter of law.

         Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, each Lender shall be
responsible for its Pro Rata Share of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses or liabilities incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with
the Obligations, the protection of any security for the Secured Obligations, the
enforcement of the Loan Documents or the management or operation of any
Collateral after acquisition of title thereto. Each Lender shall, within twenty
(20) days after a written demand therefor accompanied with a description of the
amounts payable, contribute its

                                      111
<PAGE>

respective Pro Rata Share of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, fees of receivers or trustees, court costs, title
company charges, filing and recording fees, appraisers' fees and expenses of
attorneys.

         10.13    Borrower Default. Promptly after the Administrative Agent
acquires actual knowledge that a Default has occurred, the Administrative Agent
shall evaluate the circumstances of such Default, its impact on Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors and the courses of action available to the
Lenders, which may include such responses as entering into a forbearance
agreement for a period of time, establishing certain additional credit or
collateral safeguards in exchange for a waiver of such Default or determining
the timing and order of enforcement of the remedies available to the Lenders.
Unless expressly directed in writing to the contrary by the Majority Lenders,
the Administrative Agent is expressly authorized to discuss such Default and
possible resolutions with Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors
and to refrain from exercising any rights and remedies while conducting such
evaluation, provided that the Administrative Agent shall not enter into any
written forbearance agreement with Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary
Guarantor without the prior consent of the Majority Lenders. The foregoing
provisions shall not limit the right, power or authority of the Administrative
Agent to take actions pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1 or Section
9.19.

         The Administrative Agent shall, upon completing such evaluation and if
the Administrative Agent deems it appropriate, forward to each Lender a written
proposal outlining the course of action that the Administrative Agent
recommends, if any.

         If the Majority Lenders so approve the Administrative Agent's proposal,
the Administrative Agent shall seek to implement such proposal in due course in
the same manner the Administrative Agent generally implements similar proposals
for loans held for its own account.

         The Lenders agree to cooperate in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner in connection with the exercise by the Administrative Agent of
the rights granted to the Lenders by law and the Loan Documents, including, but
not limited to, providing necessary information to the Administrative Agent with
respect to the Obligations, preparing and executing necessary affidavits,
certificates, notices, instruments and documents and participating in the
organization of applicable entities to hold title to the Opryland Hotel Florida.
Each Lender agrees that it shall subscribe to and accept its Pro Rata Share of
the ownership interests in any entity organized to hold title to the Opryland
Hotel Florida or any other Collateral. The Administrative Agent is hereby
authorized to act for and on behalf of the Lenders in all day-to-day matters
with respect to the exercise of rights described herein such as the supervision
of attorneys, accountants, appraisers or others acting for the benefit of all of
the Lenders in connection with litigation, foreclosure, realization of all or
any security given as collateral for the Secured Obligations or other similar
actions.

                                      112

         10.14    Acquisition of Collateral. If the Administrative Agent (or its
nominee or designee), on behalf of the Lenders, acquires the Opryland Hotel
Florida or any other Collateral either by foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure, then the Lenders agree to negotiate in good faith to reach
agreement among themselves in writing relating to the ownership, operation,
maintenance, marketing, and sale of the Opryland Hotel Florida. The Lenders
agree that such agreement shall be consistent with the following:

                  (a)      The Collateral will not be held as a long term
investment but will be marketed in an attempt to sell the Collateral in a time
period consistent with the regulations applicable to national banks for owning
real estate. Current Appraisals of the Collateral shall be obtained by the
Administrative Agent, such Appraisals shall be furnished to the Lenders from
time to time during the ownership period at the Lenders' expense (without
diminishing or releasing any obligation of Borrower or Parent Guarantor to pay
for such costs) and an appraised value shall be established and updated from
time to time based on such Appraisals.

                  (b)      Decision-making with respect to the day to day
operations of the Opryland Hotel Florida will be delegated to management and
leasing agents. All agreements with such management and leasing agents will be
subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders. All material decisions reserved
to the owner in such agreements will also be subject to the approval of the
Majority Lenders. The day to day supervision of such agents shall be done by the
Administrative Agent.

                  (c)      Except as provided in the immediately following
sentence, all decisions as to whether to sell the Opryland Hotel Florida and any
other Collateral shall be subject to the approval of all the Lenders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lenders agree that if the Administrative
Agent receives a bona fide "all cash" (as determined by the Administrative Agent
in its discretion) offer for the purchase of the Opryland Hotel Florida or other
Collateral which has been approved in writing by the Majority Lenders and such
offer equals or exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent appraised
values of the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or such other Collateral, as
applicable, as established by an Appraisal or Appraisals that have been
completed within six months of such offer, then the Administrative Agent is
irrevocably authorized to accept such offer on behalf of all the Lenders.

                  (d)      All expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders in connection with the Opryland Hotel Florida shall be allocated
among the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.
In the event any Lender does not pay its Pro Rata Share of such expenses, such
Lender shall be subject to the terms of Section 10.11 above.

                  (e)      All proceeds received by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender from the operation, sale or other disposition of the Opryland Hotel
Florida and any other Collateral (net of expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection therewith and any reserves deemed reasonably necessary by
the Majority Lenders for potential obligations of the Lenders with respect to
the Opryland Hotel Florida and subject to Section 10.11 above) shall be paid to
the Lenders in accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata Share from time to time
upon authorization by the Majority Lenders.

                                      113
<PAGE>

                  (f)      All expenditures and other actions taken with respect
to the Opryland Hotel Florida and any other Collateral shall at all times be
subject to the regulations and requirements pertaining to national banks
applicable thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
necessary approvals from regulatory authorities in connection with any
expenditure of funds by the Lenders shall be a condition to such expenditure.

         10.15    Documents. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, it
is acknowledged and agreed that (a) the Administrative Agent has not and shall
not provide to the other Lenders documents, other than Loan Documents delivered
as of the Effective Date, received from Borrower and Parent Guarantor with
respect to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.1 or the
conditions precedent to the initial or any subsequent Advances, but that such
documents are or shall be available for inspection by each Lender, and (b) the
determination by each Lender of whether the conditions precedent set forth in
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have been satisfied shall be for the benefit of each such
Lender only, and may not be relied on by any other party.

         10.16    Receipt and Maintenance of Loan Documents. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has received, reviewed and approved the form of the Loan
Documents delivered as of the Effective Date. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and to each of the Lenders party
hereto on the Effective Date executed original counterparts of all of the Loan
Documents, other than the originals of the Notes, each of which shall be
delivered to the Lender named therein.

         10.17    No Representations. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that
the Administrative Agent has not made any representations or warranties, express
or implied, with respect to any aspect of the Loans, including, without
limitation (i) the existing or future solvency or financial condition or
responsibility of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors, (ii)
the payment or collectibility of the Obligations, (iii) the validity,
enforceability or legal effect of the Loan Documents, or the Mortgage Title
Insurance Policy or the Surveys furnished by Borrower, or (iv) the validity or
effectiveness of the liens created by the Mortgage or any other liens or
security interests required by this Agreement.

         10.18    No Relation. The relationship between the Administrative
Agent, the Co-Lead Arrangers, Joint Book-Running Managers, Syndication Agent and
the other Lenders is not intended by the parties to create, and shall not
create, any trust, joint venture or partnership relation between them.

         10.19    Standard of Care. The Administrative Agent shall be liable to
the Lenders for any loss or liability sustained in connection with its
management and administration of the Obligations, or in connection with the
exercise of any rights and remedies under the Loan Documents or at law, only if,
and to the extent, such loss or liability results from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Administrative Agent or any of its employees,
officers, agents or directors or a breach of the Administrative Agent's express
obligations under this Agreement.

                                      114
<PAGE>

         10.20    No Responsibility for Loans, Etc. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement (including Section 10.21), none of the Administrative Agent,
the Initial Lender Affiliates or any of their respective shareholders,
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any Advance
hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified herein; (iv) the
validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; or (v) the value,
sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any interest in any collateral
security. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Initial Lender
Affiliates shall have any duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is
not required to be furnished to it by Borrower or Parent Guarantor.

         10.21    Payments After Default. Subject to the provisions of Section
10.11 regarding the subordination of any Defaulting Lender's interest, after the
occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply all payments in
respect of any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral in the following
order:

                           (i)      first, to pay Obligations in respect of any
fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Administrative
Agent;

                           (ii)     second, to pay principal of and interest on
any Protective Advance for which the Administrative Agent has not then been paid
by Borrower or Parent Guarantor or reimbursed by the Lenders;

                           (iii)    third, to pay Obligations in respect of any
fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders (other than
Rate Management Obligations);

                           (iv)     fourth, to the ratable payment, on a pari
passu basis, of (a) principal and interest on the Loans and on Unpaid Drawings
(such application to be made first to interest and then to principal) together
with the Letter of Credit Collateral Amount and (b) Secured Rate Management
Obligations; and

                           (v)      fifth, to the ratable payment of all other
Obligations.

         The order of priority set forth in this Section 10.21 is set forth
solely to determine the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders as among themselves. As between Borrower, Parent Guarantor and
Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and Lenders
on the other, after the occurrence of a Default the Administrative Agent and
Lenders may apply all payments in respect of any Secured Obligations, and all
proceeds of Collateral, to the Secured Obligations, including, without
limitation, the Letter of Credit Collateral Amount, in such order and manner as
the Administrative Agent and Lenders may elect in their sole and absolute
discretion. The order of

                                      115
<PAGE>

priority set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 10.21 may be
changed by the Majority Lenders with the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent.

         10.22    Payments Received. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent from Borrower or Parent Guarantor for the account of the Lenders shall be
disbursed to the applicable Lenders no later than the next Business Day
following the day such payment is received in good funds by the Administrative
Agent. If payments received by the Administrative Agent from Borrower or Parent
Guarantor are not disbursed to the applicable Lenders the same day as they are
received, such funds shall be invested overnight by the Administrative Agent and
each Lender will receive its Pro Rata Share of any interest so earned. The
Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent does not guarantee any
particular level of return on the overnight funds and that the Administrative
Agent will invest such funds as it deems prudent from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1     Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary Guarantor becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default
occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether
provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any
Lender to or for the credit or account of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary Guarantor may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Secured
Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Secured Obligations, or any
part thereof, shall then be due.

         11.2     Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other
than (x) payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5, (y)
payments to the Swingline Lender in respect of a Swingline Loan, either by
Borrower or by the Lenders, pursuant to a Mandatory Advance or participation in
respect of Swingline Loans, as contemplated by Section 2.1(c) and (z) payments
in respect of Unpaid Drawings or Letter of Credit Participations, as
contemplated by Sections 2.20.4 and 2.20.3) in a greater proportion than that
received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than
Swingline Loans and Letter of Credit Outstandings) held by the other Lenders so
that after such purchase each Lender will hold its applicable Pro Rata Share of
the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than Swingline Loans and Letter
of Credit Outstandings). If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or
amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or
other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to
setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary
to provide that the Administrative Agent and all Lenders share in the benefits
of such collateral in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12(b).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         12.1     Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor, Subsidiary Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and
their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors shall not have the right to assign their
respective rights or obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) any
assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. The
parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1
relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments creating
security interests, including, without limitation, financings in the nature of
repurchase agreements and any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security
interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder
unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of
Section 12.3. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan
or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow
instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to
direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of
the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be
bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent is the owner of any Loan (whether or not a Note
has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         12.2     Participations.

         12.2.1   Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Note held by
such Lender, any Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender or any other interest
of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a
Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the
holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the
Loan Documents, all amounts payable by Borrower under this Agreement shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
the Loan Documents.

                                      117
<PAGE>

         12.2.2   Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver with respect to any Advance or Revolving Loan Commitment
in which such Participant has an interest which (a) forgives principal,
interest, fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any
such Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment (except in connection with a waiver of
applicability of any post-Default increase in interest rates), extends the
Maturity Date, postpones any date fixed for any required payment of principal
of, or interest on any Loan in which such Participant has an interest, or any
regularly-scheduled payment of fees on any such Advance or Revolving Loan
Commitment, (b) releases any guarantor of any such Advance (except in connection
with an Asset Sale in accordance with the terms hereof) or all or substantially
all of any collateral, if any, securing any such Advance; (c) increases the
amount of the participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect
(it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not
constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in
any Revolving Loan Commitment (or the available portion thereof) or Loan shall
be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant's
participation therein is not increased as a result thereof) or (d) consents to
the assignment or transfer by Borrower or Parent Guarantor of any of their
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower and
Parent Guarantor and the other Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon any
actions taken by a Lender in its capacity as such, whether or not within the
scope of such Lender's authority under any agreement between the Lender and a
Participant.

         12.2.3   Benefit of Setoff. Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree that
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section
11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each
Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders
agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any
amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to
be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

         12.3     Assignments.

         12.3.1   Permitted Assignments. Subject to satisfaction of the
applicable requirements and conditions set forth in this Section 12.3, any
Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with
applicable law, at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities
("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents, subject to the following:

                           (i)      such assignment shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit D or in such other form as may be agreed to by the
Administrative Agent;

                           (ii)     the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, of Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the
Swingline Lender, shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective,
and, unless each of Borrower, Parent

                                      118
<PAGE>

Guarantor and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, each assignment with
respect to an Eligible Assignee which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof
shall be in an amount not less than the lesser of (A) $1,000,000 or (B) the sum
(calculated as at the date of such assignment) of the assigning Lender's
Available Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure; provided, however, that
(1) the consent of Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall not be required for an
assignment from one Lender to another Lender or an Affiliate thereof; (2) the
consent of Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall not be required in connection
with any such assignments occurring in connection with the primary syndication
of this facility and (3) if a Default has occurred and is continuing, no consent
of Borrower and Parent Guarantor to any assignment shall be required;

                           (iii)    Unless the Administrative Agent and the
Swingline Lender otherwise consents, a Lender shall not be permitted to assign
less than the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Available
Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure if upon completion of such assignment
the remaining amount (calculated as at the date of such assignment) of the
assigning Lender's Available Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure shall be
less than $1,000,000; and

                           (iv)     No Lender shall assign all or any part of
its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents without the Administrative
Agent's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or to any Person
other than an Eligible Assignee.

         This Section 12.3 relates only to absolute assignments and does not
prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation,
financings in the nature of repurchase agreements and any pledge or assignment
by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any
Note to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such financing,
pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor
Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have
complied with the provisions of this Section 12.3.

         12.3.2   Transfers. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Lenders
consent to each Lender's pledge (a "Pledge") of its interest in the Loans and
the Collateral to any Eligible Assignee which has extended a credit facility to
such Lender (a "Loan Pledgee"), on the terms and conditions set forth in this
paragraph. Upon written notice by the Lender to Administrative Agent that the
Pledge has been effected, Administrative Agent agrees to acknowledge receipt of
such notice and thereafter agrees: (a) to give Loan Pledgee written notice of
any default by Lenders under this Agreement and any amendment, modification,
waiver or termination of any of Lenders' rights under this Agreement; (b) that
Administrative Agent shall deliver to Loan Pledgee such estoppel certificate(s)
as Loan Pledgee shall reasonably request; and (c) that, upon written notice (a
"Redirection Notice") to Administrative Agent by Loan Pledgee that a Lender is
in default, beyond applicable cure periods, under such Lender's obligations to
Loan Pledgee pursuant to the applicable credit agreement between such Lender and
Loan Pledgee (which notice need not be joined in or confirmed by Lenders), and
until such Redirection Notice is withdrawn or rescinded by Loan Pledgee, any
payments to which such Lender is entitled from time to time pursuant to this
Agreement, or any other agreements that relate to the Loans, shall be paid or
directed to Loan Pledgee. The relevant Lender hereby unconditionally and
absolutely releases Administrative

                                      119
<PAGE>

Agent and the Lenders from any liability to the relevant Lender on account of
Administrative Agent's or any Lender's compliance with any Redirection Notice
reasonably believed by Administrative Agent or Lenders to have been delivered in
good faith. Loan Pledgee shall be permitted fully to exercise its rights and
remedies against the relevant Lender, and realize on any and all collateral
granted by such Lender to Loan Pledgee (and accept an assignment in lieu of
foreclosure as to such collateral), in accordance with applicable law and the
provisions of this Agreement. In such event, Lenders shall recognize Loan
Pledgee, and its successors and assigns which are Eligible Assignees as the
successor to the applicable Lender's rights, remedies and obligations under this
Agreement and the Loan Documents. The rights of Loan Pledgee under this
paragraph shall remain effective unless and until Loan Pledgee shall have
notified Administrative Agent in writing that its interest in the Loans has
terminated. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if a conduit
("Conduit") which is not an Eligible Assignee provides financing to a Lender
then such Conduit will be a permitted "Loan Pledgee" despite the fact it is not
an Eligible Assignee if the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the loan
(the "Conduit Inventory Loan") made by the Conduit to a Lender to finance the
acquisition and holding of such Lender's Loan will require a third party (the
"Conduit Credit Enhancer") to provide credit enhancement; (ii) the Conduit
Credit Enhancer will be an Eligible Assignee; (iii) the applicable Lender will
pledge its interest in the Loan to the Conduit as collateral for the Conduit
Inventory Loan; (iv) the Conduit Credit Enhancer and the Conduit will agree
that, if the applicable Lender defaults under the Conduit Inventory Loan, or if
the Conduit is unable to refinance its outstanding commercial paper even if
there is no default by the applicable Lender, the Conduit Credit Enhancer will
purchase the Conduit Inventory Loan from the Conduit, and the Conduit will
assign the pledge of the applicable Lender's interest in the relevant Loan to
the Conduit Credit Enhancer; and (v) the Conduit will not have any greater right
to acquire the interests in the Loan pledged by the relevant Lender, by
foreclosure or otherwise, than would any other purchaser that is not an Eligible
Assignee at a foreclosure sale conducted by a Loan Pledgee.

         12.3.3   Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the
Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by
Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 to
the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is
waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become effective on
the effective date specified in such assignment. On and after the effective date
of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to
this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the
Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and the
transferor Lender shall be discharged and released with respect to the
percentage of the Revolving Loan Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure
assigned to such Purchaser, without any further consent or action by Borrower,
Parent Guarantor, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent. Upon the consummation
of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor
Lender, the Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall make
appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes
are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate,
replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal
amounts reflecting their respective Revolving Loan Commitment and Outstanding
Credit Exposure, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

         12.4     Dissemination of Information. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
each authorize each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any
other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law
(each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in
such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors; provided that each Transferee and
prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.

         12.5     Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     NOTICES

respect to Borrowing Notices, all notices, requests and other communications to

facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a)

Lender, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages
hereof, or (b) in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile
number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the
Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when
transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation
of receipt is received, (ii) if given by certified mail, return receipt
requested, when delivered at the address specified in this Section, as indicated
by the return receipt, or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered (or,
in the case of electronic transmission, received) at the address specified in
this Section; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article II
shall not be effective until received.

         13.2     Change of Address. Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the
Administrative Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of
notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                  COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by Borrower, Parent
Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and each
