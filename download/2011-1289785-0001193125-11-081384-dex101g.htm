Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loans so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or
sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this subsection (and the Administrative Agent is hereby directed to enter into any such amendments). Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with the establishment of any Extended Term Loans
or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments the respective Credit Parties shall (at their expense) amend (and the Administrative Agent is hereby directed to amend) any Mortgage that has a maturity date prior to the then latest maturity date so that
such maturity date is extended to the then latest maturity date (or such later date as may be advised by local counsel to the Administrative Agent). </FONT></P>
