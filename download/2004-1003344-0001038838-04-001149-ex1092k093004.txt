the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below)
requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance

                  continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the
                  Interest Period applicable thereto.

         2.8. Changes in Interest Rate, Etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a
Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.7, to but

Default (including the Borrower's failure to pay any Loan at maturity) the
Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice

                                       29

                  the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
                  provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative
                  Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error
                  therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
                  Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their
                  terms.

                                       30

Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. The
Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written
confirmation, signed by an Authorized Officer, if such confirmation is requested

Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give the
Borrower and each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base
Rate.

         2.15. Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender, as applicable, and may change its
Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply
to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder
shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending
Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or
additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it or
Facility LCs will be issued by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

         2.16. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent
prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative
Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case
of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.
The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of
such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact
made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment
shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent
the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each
day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available
by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

         2.17. Replacement of Lender. If the Borrower is required pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances
into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected an "Affected
Lender"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such
suspension is still effective, to terminate or replace the Commitment and Loans
of such Affected Lender, provided that no Default or Unmatured Default shall
have occurred and be continuing at the time of such termination or replacement,
and provided further that, concurrently with such termination or replacement,
(i) if the Affected Lender is being replaced, another bank or other entity which
is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall
agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans of the Affected Lender
pursuant to an Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C and
to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all
obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to
comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii)
the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in immediately available funds on
the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then

                                       32
<PAGE>

accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and
including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to
such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any,
equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such
replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid
on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender, in each case to the
extent not paid by the purchasing lender and (iii) if the Affected Lender is
being terminated, the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender all Obligations
due to such Affected Lender (including the amounts described in the immediately
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) plus, to the extent not paid by the replacement
Lender, the outstanding principal balance of such Affected Lender's Advances).

         2.18. Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event that, at any one time, (i)
any Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a
Defaulted Loan to the Borrower and (iii) the Borrower shall be required to make
any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of
such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, so long as no Default shall occur
or be continuing at such time and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, set off and otherwise apply the Obligation of the Borrower to make such
payment to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender against the obligation
of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted Loan. In the event that, on any
date, the Borrower shall so set off and otherwise apply its obligation to make
any such payment against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make any
such Defaulted Loan on or prior to such date, the amount so set off and
otherwise applied by the Borrower shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents a Loan by such Defaulting Lender made on
the date of such setoff under the Facility pursuant to which such Defaulted Loan
was originally required to have been made pursuant to Section 2.1. Such Loan
shall be considered, for all purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the
Advance in connection with which such Defaulted Loan was originally required to
have been made pursuant to Section 2.1, even if the other Loans comprising such
Advance shall be Eurodollar Loans on the date such Loan is deemed to be made
pursuant to this subsection (a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent at any time the Borrower exercises its right of set-off pursuant to this
subsection (a) and shall set forth in such notice (A) the name of the Defaulting
Lender and the Defaulted Loan required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and
(B) the amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of such Defaulted Loan
pursuant to this subsection (a). Any portion of such payment otherwise required
to be made by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender which
is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the amount set off and otherwise
applied by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.18.

         (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount to
any Agent or any of the other Lenders and (iii) the Borrower shall make any
payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, on
its behalf or on behalf of such other Agents or such other Lenders and to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply at such time the amount so
paid by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender to the
payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to pay such
Defaulted Amount. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall so apply any
such amount to the payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount
so applied by the Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this

                                       33
<PAGE>

Agreement and the other Loan Documents payment, to such extent, of such
Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount so applied by the Administrative
Agent shall be retained by the Administrative Agent or distributed by the
Administrative Agent to such other Agents or such other Lenders, ratably in
accordance with the respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at
such time to the Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lenders
and, if the amount of such payment made by the Borrower shall at such time be
insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the
Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lenders, in the following
order of priority:

         (i)      first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then owing to
                  them, in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with
                  such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Agents;
                  and

         (ii)     second, to any other Lenders for any Defaulted Amounts then
                  owing to such other Lenders, ratably in accordance with such
                  respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lenders.

         Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account of such
         Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied
         by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be
         applied by the Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of
         this Section 2.18.

         (c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a Defaulted Loan or
a Defaulted Amount and (iii) the Borrower, any Agent or any other Lender shall
be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder or under any other Loan
Document to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower or
such Agent or such other Lender shall pay such amount to the Administrative
Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, in escrow or the Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by
it. Any funds held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection
(c) shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent in an account with a bank
(the "Escrow Bank") selected by the Administrative Agent, in the name and under
the control of the Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this
subsection (c). The terms applicable to such account, including the rate of
interest payable with respect to the credit balance of such account from time to
time, shall be the Escrow Bank's standard terms applicable to escrow accounts
maintained with it. Any interest credited to such account from time to time
shall be held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by the
Administrative Agent from time to time in accordance with the provisions of,
this subsection (c). The Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time
to the extent necessary to make any Loans required to be made by such Defaulting
Lender and to pay any amount payable by such Defaulting Lender hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender,
as and when such Loans or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the
amount so held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all
such Loans and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, in the
following order of priority:

         (i)      first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable by
                  such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder, in their capacities
                  as such, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts
                  then due and payable to the Agents;

                                       34
<PAGE>

         (ii)     second, to any other Lenders for any amount then due and
                  payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lenders
                  hereunder, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts
                  then due and payable to such other Lenders; and

         (iii)    third, to the Borrower for any Loan then required to be made
                  by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment of such
                  Defaulting Lender.

In the event that any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any time,
cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative Agent in
escrow at such time with respect to such Lender shall be distributed by the
Administrative Agent to such Lender and applied by such Lender to the
Obligations owing to such Lender at such time under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents ratably in accordance with the respective amounts of such
Obligations outstanding at such time.

         (d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this
Section 2.18 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower may
have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Loan and that
any Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to
any Defaulted Amount.

                                  ARTICLE III
                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

         3.1. Yield Protection. If, on or after the Closing Date, the adoption
of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy,
guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change
in any such law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of Reserve
Requirements):

         (i)      subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to
                  any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other
                  than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect
                  of its Eurodollar Loans, or

         (ii)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
                  assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar
                  requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
                  account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any
                  applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and
                  assessments taken into account in determining the interest
                  rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

         (iii)    imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
                  the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
                  of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans, or
                  reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable
                  Lending Installation in connection with its Eurodollar Loans,
                  or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation

                                       35
<PAGE>

                  to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of
                  Eurodollar Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount
                  deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans,
or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans, then, within 15 days of
demand, accompanied by the written statement required by Section 3.6, by such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender or LC Issuer such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or LC Issuer for such increased cost
or reduction in amount received. If, upon receipt of the notice specified by the
immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower so notifies the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower may either (i) prepay in full all Eurodollar Loans of such
Lender then outstanding, so long as the Borrower reimburses such Lender for its
increased costs in accordance with this Section 3.1, or (ii) convert all
Eurodollar Loans of all Lenders then outstanding into Floating Rate Loans in
accordance with this Agreement, so long as the Borrower reimburses the Lenders
for all of their increased costs in accordance with this Section 3.1.

         3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
or LC Issuer is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of
demand, accompanied by the written statement required by Section 3.6, by such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate
for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital
which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans, or
its Commitment to Loans, as applicable, hereunder (after taking into account
such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change
after the Closing Date in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption
of, or change in, or change in the interpretation or administration of any other
law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
Closing Date which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the Closing Date, including
transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by
regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988
report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices
Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital
Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations
adopted prior to the Closing Date.

         3.3. Availability of Types of Advances. (a) Eurodollar Advances shall
not be available on the Closing Date. For 45 days following the Closing Date no
Eurodollar Advances shall be available other than those with an Interest Period
of one month.

                  (b) If (x) any Lender reasonably determines that maintenance
of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any
applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force
of law, or (y) the Required Lenders determine in good faith that (i) deposits of
a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, or

                                       36
<PAGE>

(iii) no reasonable basis exists for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate, then
the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances
and require any affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to
Floating Rate Advances on the respective last days of the then current Interest
Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by
law, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4.

         3.4. Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar
Advance is not made or continued, or a Floating Rate Advance is not converted
into a Eurodollar Advance, on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason
other than default by the Lenders, or a Eurodollar Advance is not prepaid on the
date specified by the Borrower for any reason, the Borrower will indemnify each
Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including,
without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits
acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Advance.

         3.5. Taxes.

         (i)      All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
                  Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note
                  shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
                  and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be required by law to
                  deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
                  hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the
                  sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
                  making all required deductions (including deductions
                  applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5)
                  such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
                  receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
                  no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such
                  deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay the full amount
                  deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with
                  applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish to the
                  Administrative Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing
                  payment thereof or, if a receipt cannot be obtained with
                  reasonable efforts, such other evidence of payment as is
                  reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in each
                  case within 30 days after such payment is made.

         (ii)     In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future
                  stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
                  taxes, intangible or mortgage recording taxes, charges or
                  similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
                  under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or
                  otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other
                  Taxes").

         (iii)    The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
                  Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,
                  without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on
                  amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the
                  Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of its any
                  Advances made by it hereunder or otherwise in connection with
                  its participation in this Agreement and any liability
                  (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
                  or with respect thereto. Payments due under this

                                       37
<PAGE>

                  indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the
                  Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor
                  pursuant to Section 3.6.

         (iv)     Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
                  United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S.
                  Lender") agrees that it will, not more than ten Business Days
                  after the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement
                  (but in any event before a payment is due to it hereunder),
                  (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative
                  Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal
                  Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either
                  case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
                  this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
                  States federal income taxes, or (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S.
                  Lender that is fiscally transparent, deliver to the
                  Administrative Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form
                  W-8IMY together with the applicable accompanying forms, W-8 or
                  W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an
                  exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each
                  Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the
                  Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or
                  additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or
                  before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete,
                  and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change
                  in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional
                  forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by
                  the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. All forms or
                  amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify
                  that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
                  Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
                  States federal income taxes, unless an event (including
                  without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation)
                  has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery
                  would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
                  inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly
                  completing and delivering any such form or amendment with
                  respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving
                  payments without any deduction or withholding of United States
                  federal income tax.

         (v)      For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
                  provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to
                  clause (iv) above (unless such failure is due to a change in
                  treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
                  or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
                  occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally
                  was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not
                  be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with
                  respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that,
                  should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or
                  subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to
                  Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under
                  clause (iv) above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such
                  Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
                  Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

         (vi)     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction
                  of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
                  Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant

                                       38
<PAGE>

                  jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with
                  a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
                  prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
                  executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will
                  permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
                  reduced rate.

         (vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
                  authority of the United States or any other country or any
                  political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the
                  Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from
                  amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
                  appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed,
                  because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent
                  of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from
                  withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender
                  shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts
                  paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as
                  tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties
                  and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
                  on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this
                  subsection, together with all costs and expenses related
                  thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of
                  attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be
                  employees of the Administrative Agent). The obligations of the
                  Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment
                  of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.6. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a
Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar
Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type, currency and maturity
corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar
Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.
Notwithstanding any other term or condition contained herein or elsewhere in the
Loan Documents, a Lender claiming compensation under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or
3.5 shall only be entitled to compensation under this Article III (i) from and
after the date of such notice until the events giving rise to such claim have
ceased to exist, and (ii) during the ninety (90) day period preceding the date
the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or such Lender
setting forth the described claim for compensation. Unless otherwise provided
herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be
payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The
obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.7. Alternative Lending Installation. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in

                                       39
<PAGE>

the judgment of such Lender, reasonably disadvantageous to such Lender. A
Lender's designation of an alternative Lending Installation shall not affect the
Borrower's rights under Section 2.18 to replace a Lender.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

                  4.1.2 Copies, certified by the Secretary or Assistant
Secretary (or the equivalent thereof) of each initial Credit Party, in each
case, of its by-laws and of its Board of Directors' resolutions and of

Authorized Officers and any other officers of such Credit Party authorized to
sign the Loan Documents to which such Credit Party is party, upon which
certificate the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely

the form of Exhibit D, addressed to the Administrative Agent and signed by an

judgment of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, together with all other
information then available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries have the ability to repay their debts and satisfy

termination of the Existing Credit Agreement and the agreements, documents, and

                  4.1.13 Such other documents as the Administrative Agent or its
counsel may have reasonably requested, including, without limitation, those

                  4.1.14 The Lenders shall have completed a legal,
environmental, tax accounting and confirmatory business due diligence

and with results, satisfactory to the Lenders.

fiscal years ended October 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 including the audit reports

fairly reflect in all material respects the financial position of Tapco
Holdings, Inc. and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in members' equity and
cash flow for the periods then ended.

                  4.1.16 The Lenders shall be satisfied with the corporate and

Subsidiaries, including the terms and conditions of the charter, bylaws and each
class of Equity Interest in each Credit Party and each Subsidiary and of each
agreement or instrument relating to such structure or capitalization.

conditions of the First Lien Financing and the documentation with respect
thereto, including the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Borrower shall have

forma basis after giving effect to the Transaction, is no less than $190.0

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender and the
Administrative Agent as of each of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date of the
initial Advances hereunder (if different from the Closing Date):

         5.1. Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited
liability company (in the case of Subsidiaries only) duly and properly
incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the
extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite
authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is
conducted, except where the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.2. Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by
proper proceedings, and the Transaction Documents to which the Borrower is a
party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyances, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements
of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

         5.3. No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, of the Loan
Documents to which such Person is a party, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof,
nor the consummation of the Tapco Acquisition or the Refinancing will violate
(i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or
award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Borrower's
or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership
agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization,
by-laws, or operating agreement or other management agreement, as the case may
be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which
it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with, or constitute a default
thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in,

                                       43
<PAGE>

of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of,
any such indenture, instrument or agreement, except as in the aggregate could
not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Change. No order,
consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or
filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in
respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings
under this Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the
Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
of the Loan Documents, or the consummation of the Tapco Acquisition or the
Refinancing except as in the aggregate cannot reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.4. Financial Statements. (a) The September 30, 2003 audited
consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the
October 31, 2003 audited consolidated financial statements of Tapco Holdings,
Inc. and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition and
operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries, respectively, at such date and the consolidated results of their
operations for the period then ended. The June 30, 2004 unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Tapco Holdings,
Inc. and its Subsidiaries, respectively, heretofore delivered to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in effect on the date such statements were
prepared and fairly present, subject to year-end audit adjustments, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial condition and operations of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such date and the consolidated results of
their operations for the period then ended.

                  (b) The consolidated pro forma balance sheet of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2004 and the related Consolidated pro forma
statements of income and cash flows of the Borrower for the twelve months then
ended, certified by the chief financial officer of the Borrower, copies of which
have been furnished to each Lender Party, fairly present, subject to year-end
audit adjustments, in all material respects the consolidated pro forma financial
condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such date and the
Consolidated pro forma results of operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries for the period ended on such date, in each case giving effect to
the Tapco Acquisition, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

         5.5. Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 2003, there has been
no Material Adverse Change and since October 31, 2003, there has been no
material adverse change in the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
operations, performance and properties of Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                                       44
<PAGE>

         5.6. Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns, Utah state tax returns and, to the Borrower's best
knowledge after due inquiry, all other tax returns which are required to be
filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any
assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
respect of such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to
which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists (except as permitted by
Section 6.15.1), except as could not be reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change. No Liens have been filed and no claims are being
asserted with respect to such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the
books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other
governmental charges are adequate under Agreement Accounting Principles.

         5.7. Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Change or affecting Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations,
performance or properties of Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole, or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Credit
Extensions. Other than liabilities incident to any litigation, arbitration or
proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to be in an aggregate amount
in excess of $1,000,000 or as disclosed in Schedule 5.7, the Borrower has no
material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial
statements referred to in Section 5.4.

         5.8. Subsidiaries. Schedule 5.8 contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by such Credit
Party or one or more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, except
those created under the Collateral Documents and the second priority liens
created under the Second Lien Collateral Documents.

         5.9. ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do
not in the aggregate exceed $1,000,000. Neither the Borrower nor any other
member of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur,
pursuant to Section 4201 of ERISA, any withdrawal liability to Multiemployer
Plans an amount that would result in a Material Adverse Change. Each Plan
complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and
regulations. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan. Neither
the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan within the meaning of Title IV of
ERISA or initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize or
terminate, within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, any Multiemployer Plan. No
steps have been taken to initiate the termination of any Plan, and the PBGC has
not given notice that it intends to terminate any Plan.

                                       45
<PAGE>

         5.10. Accuracy of Information. (a) No Loan Document or written
statement furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Administrative Agent or to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or
compliance with, the Loan Documents contained any material misstatement of fact
or omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading.

                  (b) The consolidated forecasted financial statements of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 6.1.7
were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions stated therein,
which assumptions were fair in light of the conditions existing at the time of
delivery of such forecasts, and represented, at the time of delivery, the
Borrower's best estimate of its future financial performance.

         5.11. Regulation U. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate of
buying or carrying margin stock (as defined in Regulation U), and after applying
the proceeds of each Credit Extension, margin stock (as defined in Regulation U)
constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or any other
restriction hereunder.

         5.12. Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Change. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any (i) agreement or instrument to which it is a party,
which default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

         5.13. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective Property, except as cannot
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.14. Ownership of Properties. (a) Set forth on Schedule 5.14(a)(i)
hereto is a complete and accurate list of all Owned Real Property as of the date
hereof, showing as of the date hereof the street address, county or other
relevant jurisdiction, state, record owner and book and estimated fair market
value thereof; (ii) set forth on Schedule 5.14(a)(ii) hereto is a complete and
accurate list of all Real Property Leases as of the date hereof, showing the
street address or other information sufficient to identify the location of the

entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of
Loans hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

         5.16. Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business,
the officers of the Borrower consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which they
identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to the Borrower
due to Environmental Laws. On the basis of this consideration, the Borrower has
concluded that Environmental Laws are not reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with
any of the requirements of applicable Environmental Laws or are the subject of
any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is
needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into
the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.17. Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance
on all their Property in such amounts, subject to such deductibles and
self-insurance retentions and covering such properties and risks as is
consistent with sound business practice.

         5.20. No Default or Unmatured Default. No Default or Unmatured Default
has occurred and is continuing.

         5.21. SDN List Designation. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a country, individual or entity named on the

otherwise consent in writing:

         6.1. [Reserved.]

         6.2. Limitation on Indebtedness. (vii) The Borrower will not, and will
not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (other
than the Loans and Indebtedness existing on the Closing Date); provided that the
Borrower or any Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness if, after giving pro forma
effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and the receipt and application of
the proceeds therefrom (as though such Incurrence and receipt and application
had occurred on the first day of the most recently ended four fiscal quarter
period), no Default under Section 6.17 shall have occurred and be continuing.

         (viii) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6.2(a), the Borrower and
any Restricted Subsidiary (except as specified below) may Incur each and all of
the following:

         (i)      Indebtedness of the Borrower and any Guarantor outstanding at
                  any time in an aggregate principal amount (together with
                  refinancings thereof) not to exceed $725 million under the
                  First Lien Credit Agreement less any amount of such
                  Indebtedness permanently repaid as provided under Section
                  6.10;

         (ii)     Indebtedness owed (A) to the Borrower or any Guarantor
                  evidenced by an unsubordinated promissory note or (B) to any
                  other Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (x) any event which
                  results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a
                  Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of such
                  Indebtedness (other than to the Borrower or another Restricted
                  Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an
                  Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause
                  (ii) and (y) if the Borrower or any Guarantor is the obligor
                  on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly
                  subordinated in right of payment to the Loans, in the case of
                  the Borrower, or the Guaranty, in the case of a Guarantor on
                  the terms set forth in Schedule 6.2(b)(ii) hereto;

         (iii)    Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the net proceeds of
                  which are used to refinance, refund, replace, renew or extend

                  then outstanding Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
                  outstanding under clause (ii) or (iv) hereof) and any
                  refinancings thereof in an amount not to exceed the amount so
                  refinanced or refunded (plus premiums, accrued and unpaid
                  interest, fees, underwriting discounts, commissions and

                                       48

                  which are used to refinance or refund the Loans or
                  Indebtedness that is pari passu with, or subordinated in right
                  of payment to, the Loans or the Guaranty shall only be
                  permitted under this clause (iii) if (x) in case the Loans are
                  refinanced in part or the Indebtedness to be refinanced is
                  pari passu with the Loans or the Guaranty, such new
                  Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any agreement or
                  instrument pursuant to which such new Indebtedness is
                  outstanding, is expressly made pari passu with, or subordinate
                  in right of payment to, the remaining Loans or the Guaranty,
                  or (y) in case the Indebtedness to be refinanced is
                  subordinated in right of payment to the Loans or the Guaranty,
                  such new Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any
                  agreement or instrument pursuant to which such new
                  Indebtedness is issued or remains outstanding, is expressly
                  made subordinate in right of payment to the Loans or the
                  Guaranty at least to the extent that the Indebtedness to be
                  refinanced is subordinated to the Loans or the Guaranty, (b)
                  such new Indebtedness, determined as of the date of Incurrence
                  of such new Indebtedness, does not mature prior to the Stated
                  Maturity of the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded, and
                  the Average Life of such new Indebtedness is at least equal to
                  the remaining Average Life of the Indebtedness to be
                  refinanced or refunded and (c) such new Indebtedness is
                  Incurred by the Borrower or a Guarantor or by the Restricted
                  Subsidiary who is the obligor on the Indebtedness to be
                  refinanced or refunded;

         (iv)     Indebtedness existing on the date hereof and described in
                  Schedule 6.2(b)(iv) (and renewals, refinancings or extensions
                  thereof on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
                  applicable obligor than such existing Indebtedness and in a
                  principal amount not in excess of that outstanding as of the
                  date of such renewal, refinancing or extension);

         (v)      To the extent approved by the Administrative Agent,
                  Indebtedness arising under Rate Management Transactions;

                  Capitalized Leases) incurred by the Borrower or any of its
                  Subsidiaries after the Closing Date to finance the acquisition
                  of assets used in its business, if (1) the total of all such
                  Indebtedness for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken
                  together incurred on or after the Closing Date shall not
                  exceed an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 at any one
                  time outstanding, (2) such Indebtedness when incurred shall
                  not exceed the purchase price of the asset(s) financed, (3) no
                  such Indebtedness shall be refinanced for a principal amount
                  in excess of the principal balance outstanding thereon at the
                  time of such refinancing, and (4) any Lien securing such
                  Indebtedness is permitted under Section 6.8 (such Indebtedness
                  being referred to herein as "Permitted Purchase Money
                  Indebtedness");

                  maximum amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant
                  to this Section 6.2 will not be deemed to be exceeded, with
                  respect to any outstanding Indebtedness due solely to the

         (x)      For purposes of determining any particular amount of
                  Indebtedness under this Section 6.2, (x) Indebtedness Incurred

                  determining compliance with this Section 6.2, in the event
                  that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than

                  discretion, shall classify, and from time to time may
                  reclassify, such item of Indebtedness.

         (xii)    The Borrower will not Incur any Indebtedness if such
                  Indebtedness is subordinate in right of payment to any other
                  Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness is also subordinate in

the Closing Date shall exceed the sum of

         (i)      50% of the aggregate amount of the Adjusted Consolidated Net
                  Income (or, if the Adjusted Consolidated Net Income is a
                  negative number, 100% of the negative amount is included in

                  day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the Closing
                  Date and ending on the last day of the last fiscal quarter

                  Disqualified Stock) to a Person who is not a Subsidiary of the
                  Borrower, including an issuance or sale permitted by this
                  Agreement of Indebtedness of the Borrower for cash subsequent
                  to the Closing Date upon the conversion of such Indebtedness
                  into Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the

                  rights to acquire Capital Stock of the Borrower (in each case,
                  exclusive of any Disqualified Stock or any options, warrants
                  or other rights that are redeemable at the option of the
                  holder, or are required to be redeemed, prior to the Maturity

                  Subsidiary or from the Net Cash Proceeds from the sale of any
                  such Investment (except, in each case, to the extent any such
                  payment or proceeds are included in the calculation of
                  Adjusted Consolidated Net Income), or from redesignations of
                  Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued
                  in each case as provided in the definition of "Investments"),
                  not to exceed, in each case, the amount of Investments
                  previously made by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
                  in such Person or Unrestricted Subsidiary.

                  (vi) Investments acquired as a capital contribution to, or in
         exchange for, or out of the proceeds of a substantially concurrent
         offering of, Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the
         Borrower;

                  (vii) the repurchase of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon the
         exercise of options or warrants if such Capital Stock represents all or
         a portion of the exercise price thereof;

                  (viii) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or
         other acquisition for value of shares of, or options to purchase shares
         of, common stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from
         employees, former employees, directors or former directors of the

                                       52
<PAGE>

         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or permitted transferees of such
         employees, former employees, directors or former directors), pursuant
         to the terms of any of the Borrower Incentive Plans; or

                  (ix) Restricted Payments, not otherwise described in clauses
         (i) through (viii) above, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20
         million.

                  Each Restricted Payment permitted pursuant to the preceding
paragraph (other than the Restricted Payment referred to in clause (ii) thereof,
an exchange of Capital Stock for Capital Stock or Indebtedness referred to in
clause (iii) or (iv) thereof, an Investment acquired as a capital contribution
or in exchange for Capital Stock referred to in clause (vi) thereof and the
repurchase of Capital Stock referred to in clause (vii) thereof), and the Net
Cash Proceeds from any issuance of Capital Stock referred to in clause (iii),
(iv) or (vi), shall be included in calculating whether the conditions of clause
(c) of the first paragraph of this Section 6.3 have been met with respect to any
subsequent Restricted Payments. In the event the proceeds of an issuance of
Capital Stock of the Borrower are used for the redemption, repurchase or other
acquisition of the Notes, or Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Loans or
the Guaranty, then the Net Cash Proceeds of such issuance shall be included in
clause (c) of the first paragraph of this Section 6.3 only to the extent such
proceeds are not used for such redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of
Indebtedness.

                  For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.3,
(x) the amount, if other than in cash, of any Restricted Payment shall be
determined in good faith by the Disinterested Members of the Board of Directors,
whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution and
(y) in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one
of the types of Restricted Payments described in the above clauses, including
the first paragraph of this Section 6.3, the Borrower, in its sole discretion,
may order and classify, and from time to time may reclassify, such Restricted
Payment if it would have been permitted at the time such Restricted Payment was
made and at the time of such reclassification.

         6.4. Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become
effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability
of any Restricted Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any other
distributions permitted by applicable law on any Capital Stock of such
Restricted Subsidiary owned by the Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary,
(ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or any other Restricted
Subsidiary, (iii) make loans or advances to the Borrower or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or (iv) transfer any of its property or assets to the Borrower or any
other Restricted Subsidiary.

         The foregoing provisions shall not restrict any encumbrances or
restrictions:

                  (a) existing on the Closing Date in the First Lien Credit
Agreement, this Agreement or any other agreements in effect on the Closing Date,
and any extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements of such agreements;
provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such extensions,

                                       53
<PAGE>

refinancings, renewals or replacements taken as a whole are no less favorable in
any material respect to the Holders of the Obligations than those encumbrances
or restrictions that are then in effect and that are being extended, refinanced,
renewed or replaced;

                  (b) existing under or by reason of applicable law, regulation,
rule or order;

                  (c) existing with respect to any Person or the property or
assets of such Person acquired by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary,
existing at the time of such acquisition and not incurred in contemplation
thereof, which encumbrances or restrictions are not applicable to any Person or
the property or assets of any Person other than such Person or the property or
assets of such Person so acquired and any extensions, refinancings, renewals or
replacements of thereof; provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any
such extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements taken as a whole are no
less favorable in any material respect to the Holders than those encumbrances or
restrictions that are then in effect and that are being extended, refinanced,
renewed or replaced;

                  (d) in the case of clause (iv) of the first paragraph of this
Section 6.4:

                  (i) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting,
         assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is a lease,
         license, conveyance or contract or similar property or asset,

                  (ii) existing by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to
         transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or
         assets of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise
         prohibited by this Agreement or

                  (iii) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business,
         not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in
         the aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of the
         Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the
         Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary;

                  (iv) with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary and imposed
         pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or
         disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock of, or
         property and assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary;

                  (v) existing in agreements governing Indebtedness of any
         Guarantor permitted to be Incurred after the date of this Agreement,
         provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or
         restrictions are no more restrictive than those permitted under clause
         (a) above, and any extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements
         of such Indebtedness; and provided that the encumbrances or
         restrictions in any such extensions, refinancings, renewals or
         replacements taken as a whole are no less favorable in any material
         respect to the Holders than those encumbrances or restrictions that are
         then in effect and that are being extended, refinanced, renewed or
         replaced;

                                       54
<PAGE>

                  (vi) existing under purchase money obligations for property
         acquired in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
         practice that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so
         acquired of the nature described in clause (iv) of the first paragraph
         of this Section 6.4; and

                  (vii) customary provisions with respect to the distribution of
         assets or property in joint venture agreements and other similar
         agreements.

Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prevent the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary from (1) creating, incurring, assuming or suffering to
exist any Liens otherwise permitted by Section 6.8 or (2) restricting the sale
or other disposition of property or assets of the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that secure Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries.

         6.5. Limitation on the Issuance and Sale of Capital Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries. The Borrower will not sell, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to issue or sell, any shares of Capital
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary (including options, warrants or other rights to
purchase shares of such Capital Stock) except:

                  (a) to the Borrower or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary;

                  (b) issuances of director's qualifying shares or sales to
foreign nationals of shares of Capital Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries, to the
extent required by applicable law;

                  (c) if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or
sale, such Restricted Subsidiary would no longer constitute a Restricted
Subsidiary and any Investment in such Person remaining after giving effect to
such issuance or sale would have been permitted to be made under Section 6.3 if
made on the date of such issuance or sale; or

                  (d) sales of Capital Stock other than Disqualified Stock
(including options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of such Capital
Stock) of a Restricted Subsidiary by the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary,
provided that the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary applies the Net Cash
Proceeds of any such sale in accordance with clause (A) or (B) of the second
paragraph of Section 6.10.

         6.6. Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries. The Borrower will cause
each Restricted Subsidiary, other than a Foreign Subsidiary or a Restricted
Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of a Permitted
Investment under clause (xv) of the definition of Permitted Investment, to
execute and deliver the Guaranty or, if such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date, a supplement to the Guaranty.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Guaranty may provide by
its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not an Affiliate
of the Borrower, of all of the Borrower's and each Restricted Subsidiary's
Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted
Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is otherwise permitted by this

                                       55
<PAGE>

Agreement) or upon the designation of such Restricted Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii)
to the extent that the aggregate EBITDA of FlexCrete Building Systems, L.C.,
Florida N-Viro L.P. and Florida N-Viro Management, LLC for the most recently
completed four fiscal quarter period does not exceed one percent (1%) of the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the same period,
the Borrower shall not be required to cause FlexCrete Building Systems, L.C.,
Florida N-Viro, L.P. or Florida N-Viro Management, LLC to guarantee the
Obligations.

         6.7. Limitation on Transactions with Shareholders and Affiliates. The
Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, enter into, renew or extend any transaction (including, without
limitation, the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of property or assets, or the
rendering of any service) with any holder (or any Affiliate of such holder) of
5% or more of any class of Capital Stock of the Borrower or with any Affiliate
of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, unless such transaction or series
of related transactions is on fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the
Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary than could be obtained, at the time of
such transaction or, if such transaction is pursuant to a written agreement, at
the time of the execution of the agreement providing therefor, in a comparable
arm's-length transaction with a Person that is not such a holder or an
Affiliate.

         The foregoing limitation does not limit, and shall not apply to:

                  (i) any transaction solely between the Borrower and any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries or solely between Restricted Subsidiaries;

                  (ii) the payment of reasonable and customary regular fees to
         directors of the Borrower who are not employees of the Borrower,
         insurance premiums in connection with directors' and officers'
         insurance and indemnification arrangements entered into by the Borrower
         consistent with past practices of the Borrower or typical for companies
         with businesses similar to that of the Borrower;

                  (iii) any payments or other transactions pursuant to any
         tax-sharing agreement between the Borrower and any other Person with
         which the Borrower files a consolidated tax return or with which the
         Borrower is part of a consolidated group for tax purposes;

                  (iv) any sale of shares of Capital Stock (other than
         Disqualified Stock) of the Borrower;

                  (v) any Permitted Investments or any Restricted Payments not
         prohibited by Section 6.3;

                  (vi) any issuance of securities pursuant to employment
         arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans;

                  (vii) loans or advances to employees of the Borrower or any of
         its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business in
         accordance with past practices of the Borrower, but in any event not to
         exceed $2.5 million in the aggregate outstanding at any one time;

                  (viii) the renewal or extension of any agreement or
         arrangement in existence on the Closing Date to which the Borrower or
         any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party and that is described on
         Schedule 6.7 to this Agreement, as these agreements may be amended,
         modified or supplemented from time to time; provided, however, that any

                                       56
<PAGE>

         future amendment, modification or supplement entered into after the
         Closing Date will be permitted to the extent that its terms are not
         materially less favorable to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary
         than the terms of the agreements or arrangements in effect on the
         Closing Date; and

         6.8. Limitation on Liens. The Borrower will not, and will not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien
in, of or on any of the Property of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary.

         The foregoing limitation does not apply to:

                  6.8.1 Liens existing on the Closing Date;

Owned Restricted Subsidiary to secure Indebtedness owing to the Borrower or such
other Restricted Subsidiary;

                  6.8.4 Liens securing Indebtedness which is Incurred to
refinance secured Indebtedness which is permitted to be Incurred under clause

                  6.8.5 Liens to secure Indebtedness Incurred under clause (i)

                  6.8.6 Liens on cash set aside at the time of the Incurrence of
any Indebtedness, or government securities purchased with such cash, in either
case to the extent that such cash or government securities pre-fund the payment
of interest on such Indebtedness and are held in a collateral or escrow account
or similar arrangement to be applied for such purpose;

                  6.8.7 Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or
levies on its Property if the same shall not at the time be delinquent or
thereafter can be paid without penalty, or are being contested in good faith and
by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with
Agreement Accounting Principles shall have been set aside on its books, unless
and until any Lien resulting therefrom attaches to its Property or becomes
enforceable against its other creditors.

                  6.8.8 Liens imposed by law, such as landlords', wage earners',
carriers', warehousemen's and mechanics' liens and other similar liens arising
in the ordinary course of business which (a) secure payment of obligations not
more than 60 days past due, (b) are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles shall have been set aside on its books, or (c)

                                       57
<PAGE>

the use of the Property to which they relate.

nature incurred in the ordinary course of business.

                  6.8.12 Easements, reservations, rights-of-way, restrictions,
survey exceptions and other similar encumbrances as to real property of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries which customarily exist on properties
of corporations engaged in similar activities and similarly situated and which
(a) were not incurred in connection with and do not secure indebtedness (except
as expressly permitted by this Section 6.8), (b) do not render title to the
property encumbered thereby unmarketable, and (c) do not materially interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary
conducted at the property subject thereto.

                  6.8.13 Purchase money Liens securing Permitted Purchase Money
Indebtedness; provided, that such Liens shall not apply to any property of the

<PAGE>

                  6.8.18 Liens in respect of judgments that do not otherwise
cause a Default under this Agreement.

                  6.8.19 Liens arising out of the refinancing, extension,

amount not to exceed an amount equal to 5% of Consolidated Tangible Assets at
any time outstanding.

                  In addition, neither Borrower nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall become a party to any agreement, note, indentures or other
instrument, or take any other action, which would prohibit the creation of a
Lien on any of its Properties or other assets in favor of the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Obligations; provided, further, that
any agreement, note, indenture or other instrument in connection with purchase
money Indebtedness (including Capitalized Leases) for which the related Liens
are permitted hereunder may prohibit the creation of a Lien in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Obligations, with
respect to the assets or property obtained with the proceeds of such
Indebtedness.

         6.9. Limitation on Sale-Leaseback Transactions. The Borrower will not,
and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any sale-leaseback
transaction involving any of its assets or properties whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, whereby the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary sells or
transfers such assets or properties and then or thereafter leases such assets or
properties or any part thereof or any other assets or properties which the
Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, intends to use for
substantially the same purpose or purposes as the assets or properties sold or
transferred.

                  The foregoing restriction does not apply to any sale-leaseback
transaction if (i) the lease is for a period, including renewal rights, of not
in excess of three years; (ii) the lease secures or relates to industrial
revenue or pollution control bonds; (iii) the transaction is solely between the
Borrower and any Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary or solely between Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiaries; or (iv) the Borrower or such Restricted
Subsidiary, within 12 months after the sale or transfer of any assets or
properties is completed, applies an amount not less than the net proceeds
received from such sale in accordance with the second paragraph clause (i) or
(ii) of Section 6.10(b).

         6.10. Limitation on Asset Sales. (a) The Borrower will not, and will
not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale, unless (i)
the consideration received by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary is at
least equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or disposed of and (ii)
at least 75% of the consideration received consists of (A) cash or Cash
Equivalent Investments, (B) the assumption of unsubordinated Indebtedness of the

                                       59
<PAGE>

Borrower or any Guarantor or Indebtedness of any other Restricted Subsidiary (in
each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or any Affiliate of the
Borrower), provided that the Borrower, such Guarantor or such other Restricted
Subsidiary is irrevocably and unconditionally released from all liability under
such Indebtedness or (C) Replacement Assets.

         (b) In the event and to the extent that the Net Cash Proceeds received
by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from one or more Asset
Sales occurring on or after the Closing Date in any fiscal year exceed 1% of
Consolidated Total Assets, then the Borrower shall or shall cause the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary to:

                  (i) within 12 months after the date Net Cash Proceeds so
         received exceed the amount set forth in the immediately preceding
         paragraph,

                           (A) apply an amount equal to such excess Net Cash
                  Proceeds to permanently repay Indebtedness under the First
                  Lien Credit Agreement, or

                           (B) invest an equal amount, or the amount not so
                  applied pursuant to clause (A) (or enter into a definitive
                  agreement committing to so invest within 12 months after the
                  date of such agreement), in Replacement Assets (including,
                  without limitation, by using such amount to repay Indebtedness
                  Incurred to acquire Replacement Assets that were acquired in
                  anticipation of the applicable Asset Sale), and

                  (ii) apply (no later than the end of the 12-month period
         referred to in clause (i)) such excess Net Cash Proceeds (to the extent
         not applied pursuant to clause (i)) as provided in the following
         paragraphs of this Section 6.10.

The amount of such excess Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied (or to be
committed to be applied) during such 12-month period as set forth in clause (i)
of the preceding sentence and not applied as so required by the end of such
period shall constitute "Excess Proceeds."

                  If, as of the first day of any calendar month after the end of
the 12-month period set forth in clause (i) of the preceding paragraph, there
are any Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Offer to Prepay, the
Borrower must commence, not later than the fifteenth Business Day of such month,
and consummate an Offer to Prepay to the Lenders on a pro rata basis an
aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date,
at a purchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus, in each case,
accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the Payment Date and any applicable
premium as set forth in Section 2.5.

                  To the extent that the aggregate amount of Loans for which
prepayment is validly elected and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Offer to
Prepay is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Borrower may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds for any other purpose which is permitted by this Agreement.

                  If the aggregate principal amount of Loans for which Lenders
elect prepayment exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Administrative Agent
shall select the Loans to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the

                                       60
<PAGE>

aggregate principal amount of Loans electing prepayment. Upon completion of such
Offer to Prepay, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

         6.11. Existence. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same
manner and in substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently
conducted and do all things necessary to remain duly incorporated or organized,
validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good
standing as a domestic corporation, partnership or limited liability company in
its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, as in
effect on the Closing Sate, and maintain all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

         6.12. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims. The Borrower will, and will
cause each Subsidiary to, timely file complete and correct United States federal
and applicable foreign, state and local tax returns required by law and pay when
due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or its
income, profits or Property, except those which are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves
have been set aside in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles;
provided, however, that it shall not be a Default or Unmatured Default under
this Section 6.5 if all such failures in the aggregate do not result in a
Material Adverse Change.

         6.13. Maintenance of Properties and Insurance. The Borrower will cause
all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries material to the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole to be maintained and kept in normal condition,
repair and working order (reasonable wear and tear excepted) and will cause to
be made all necessary repairs, renewals and replacements thereof, all as in the
judgment of the Borrower may be necessary so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times; provided that
nothing in this Section 6.13 shall prevent the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary from discontinuing the use, operation or maintenance of any of such
properties or disposing of any of them, if such discontinuance or disposal is,
in the judgment of the Borrower, desirable in the conduct of the business of the
Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary.

         The Borrower will provide or cause to be provided, for itself and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, insurance (including appropriate self-insurance)
against loss or damage of the kinds that in the reasonable good faith judgment
of the Borrower is adequate and appropriate for the conduct of the business of
the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

         6.14. Notice of Defaults. Within three (3) Business Days after an
Authorized Officer becomes aware thereof, the Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give notice in writing to the Lenders of the occurrence (i) of
any Default or Unmatured Default and (ii) of any other development, financial or
otherwise, which (solely with respect to this clause (ii)) could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

Obligations to secure the Obligations in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Collateral Documents, subject in any case to Liens permitted

Obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collateral
Documents or such other security documents as the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no pledge agreement in
respect of the equity interests of a Foreign Subsidiary shall be required
hereunder to the extent such pledge thereunder is prohibited by applicable law
or the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that such pledge would not
provide material credit support for the benefit of the Holders of Secured
Obligations pursuant to legally valid, binding and enforceable pledge agreements
and (2) no such pledge agreement shall be required to be delivered with respect
to Foreign Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date, unless otherwise
determined in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent upon 45 days

terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents, subject in each case to Liens
created or permitted by the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, such
items that will constitute Permitted Encumbrances. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will, and will cause each Guarantor
to, deliver Mortgages and, to the extent applicable, Mortgage Instruments with
respect to the Real Property Collateral to the extent, and within such time
period as is, reasonably required by the Administrative Agent; provided,
however, that with respect to the Real Property Collateral existing as of the

<PAGE>

Closing Date, no such Mortgages, Mortgage Instruments and pledge agreements are
required to be delivered hereunder until 90 days following the Closing Date with
respect to Real Property Collateral and 120 days following the Closing Date with
respect to all other Real Property Collateral (it being understood and agreed
that the failure to deliver such Mortgages, Mortgage Instruments and pledge
agreements by 120 days following the Closing Date or such date 30 days later as
the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion shall constitute a
Default under Section 7.3); provided that the Borrower hereby agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to cause the delivery of such Mortgages and Mortgage
Instruments as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in addition to each Mortgage delivered pursuant to

         Secured Obligations and that all applicable filing and recording taxes

                  Required Lenders) may (a) terminate or suspend the obligations
                  of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder or declare the
                  Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the
                  Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
                  presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of
                  which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

         (ii)     If, after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or
                  termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans as
                  a result of any Default (other than any Default as described
                  in Section 7.8 or 7.9 with respect to the Borrower) and before
                  any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due
                  shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in
                  their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative
                  Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such
                  acceleration and/or termination.

         8.2. Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2 and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with
the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into
agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any
provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the
Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder
or thereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of all of the Lenders (other than any Lender that is, at
such time, a Defaulting Lender), except for any amendment, waiver or consent
with respect to the items set forth in Sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.3, which shall
only require the consent of all of the Lenders directly affected by such
amendment, waiver or consent:

                  8.2.1 Extend the final maturity date of any Loan to a date
after the Maturity Date, or postpone any regularly scheduled payment of
principal of any Loan or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount
thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees
thereon (other than a waiver of the application of the default rate of interest
pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof.

                                       69
<PAGE>

                  8.2.2 Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Lenders or any other percentage of Lenders specified to be the
applicable percentage in this Agreement to act on specified matters or amend the
definition of "Pro Rata Share".

                  8.2.3 Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender
hereunder.

                  8.2.4 Amend this Section 8.2, or permit the Borrower to assign
its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

                  8.2.5 Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, other than in connection with a transaction permitted under this
Agreement, release all or substantially all of the Collateral.

                  8.2.6 Other than in connection with a transaction permitted
under this Agreement, release all or substantially all of the value of the
Guaranty.

If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver, or consent, the consent
of all of the Lenders, or all of the Lenders directly affected thereby, is
required pursuant to this Section 8.2, and any such Lender refuses to consent to
such amendment, waiver or consent (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained
as described in this Section 8.2 being referred to as a "Non-Consenting
Lender"), then, so long as the Administrative Agent is not a Non-Consenting
Lender, at the Borrower's request, the Administrative Agent or an Eligible
Assignee shall be entitled (but shall have no obligation) to purchase from such
Non-Consenting Lender, and such Non-Consenting Lender (by its acceptance of the
benefits of the Loan Documents) agrees that it shall, upon the Administrative
Agent's request, sell and assign to the Administrative Agent or such Eligible
Assignee, all of the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender or Non-Consenting
Lenders for an amount equal to the principal balance of all Loans held by the
Non-Consenting Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto
through the date of sale. Each Lender (by its acceptance of the benefits of the
Loan Documents) agrees that, if it becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, it shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance to
evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
any Note (if the assigning Lender's Loans are evidenced by Notes) subject to
such Assignment and Acceptance; provided, however, that the failure of any
Non-Consenting Lender to execute an Assignment and Acceptance shall not render
such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) ineffective.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to or affecting the
Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee
without obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement.

         8.3. Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no

                                       70
<PAGE>

waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of
the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by, or by
the Administrative Agent with the consent of, the requisite number of Lenders
required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing
specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law
afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders until all of the Obligations have been paid in full.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1. Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties of
the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the
Advances herein contemplated.

         9.2. Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to
the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

         9.3. Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.4. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof
other than those contained in the fee letter described in Section 10.13 which
shall survive and remain in full force and effect during the term of this
Agreement.

         9.5. Several Obligations; Benefits of This Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to
confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that
the parties hereto expressly agree that the Lead Arrangers shall enjoy the
benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent
specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such
provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it
were a party to this Agreement.

         9.6. Expenses; Indemnification. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and time charges
of attorneys for the Administrative Agent) paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lead Arrangers in connection with the investigation,
preparation, negotiation, documentation, execution, delivery, syndication,
distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet), review,
amendment, modification and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower
also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers and the

                                       71
<PAGE>

Lenders for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and time charges and
expenses of attorneys and paralegals for the Administrative Agent, the Lead
Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys and paralegals may be employees of
the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers or the Lenders) paid or incurred by
the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers or any Lender in connection with
the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents. Expenses being reimbursed
by the Borrower under this Section include, without limitation, the cost and
expense of obtaining an appraisal of each parcel of real property or interest in
real property described in any relevant Collateral Document, which appraisal
shall be in conformity with the applicable requirements of any law or any
governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not
having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, and any rules
promulgated to implement such provisions and costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Reports described in the following sentence.

                  (ii) The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, each Lender, their respective
affiliates, and each of their directors, officers and employees against all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and out-of-pocket
expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or
preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Lead
Arrangers, any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto, and all attorneys'
and paralegals' fees, time charges and expenses of attorneys and paralegals of
the party seeking indemnification, which attorneys and paralegals may or may not
be employees of such party seeking indemnification) which any of them may pay or
incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or
proposed application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder except to
the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         9.7. Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to each
of the Lenders, as shall have been reasonably requested of the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent.

         9.8. Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used in the calculation of any financial covenant or test shall
be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder in the calculation of
any financial covenant or test shall be made in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles. If any changes in generally accepted accounting
principles are hereafter required or permitted and are adopted by the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries with the agreement of its independent certified
public accountants and such changes result in a change in the method of
calculation of any of the financial covenants, tests, restrictions or standards
herein or in the related definitions or terms used therein ("Accounting
Changes"), the parties hereto agree, at the Borrower's request, to enter into
negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend such provisions in a credit
neutral manner so as to reflect equitably such changes with the desired result
that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' financial
condition shall be the same after such changes as if such changes had not been
made; provided, however, until such provisions are amended in a manner

                                       72
<PAGE>

reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, no
Accounting Change shall be given effect in such calculations. In the event such
amendment is entered into, all references in this Agreement to Agreement
Accounting Principles shall mean generally accepted accounting principles as of
the date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all financial
statements to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect
at such time.

         9.9. Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10. Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand
shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Administrative Agent,
the Lead Arrangers nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to
the Borrower. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers nor any
Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business
or operations. The Borrower agrees that neither the Administrative Agent, the
Lead Arrangers nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether
sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions
contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act,
omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in
a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party
from which recovery is sought. None of the parties hereto shall have any
liability with respect to, and each party hereto hereby waives, releases and
agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
suffered by any such party in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

         9.11. Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees
to hold any confidential information which it may receive from the Borrower in
connection with this Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its
Affiliates and to the Administrative Agent and any other Lender and their
respective Affiliates, to the extent such Person is or is reasonably expected to
be involved in the evaluation of such information in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants,
and other professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee, (iii) to
regulatory officials, (iv) to any Person as required by law, regulation, or
legal process, or to any Person as required in connection with any legal
proceeding to which it is a party, provided that the Borrower shall have
received prior written notice of such disclosure to the extent such notice is
permitted and the disclosing party shall have taken all steps reasonably
requested by the Borrower to protect the confidentiality of the information so
disclosed, (v) to its direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or to legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors to
such counterparties, to the extent required in connection with such swap

                                       73
<PAGE>

agreements, (vi) permitted by Section 12.4, and (vii) to rating agencies subject
to confidentiality restrictions reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, if
requested or required by such agencies in connection with a rating relating to
the Advances hereunder. Without limiting Section 9.4, the Borrower agrees that
the terms of this Section 9.11 shall set forth the entire agreement between the
Borrower and each Lender (including the Administrative Agent) with respect to
any confidential information previously or hereafter received by such Lender in
connection with this Agreement, and this Section 9.11 shall supersede any and
all prior confidentiality agreements entered into by such Lender with respect to
such confidential information.

         9.12. Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying
on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in
the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for herein.

         9.13. Disclosure. The Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledge and
agree that each Lender and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold
investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the
Borrower and its Affiliates.

         9.14. Performance of Obligations. The Borrower agrees that the
Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to (i) at any time, pay
or discharge taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances levied or
placed on or threatened against any Collateral and (ii) after the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Default make any other payment or perform any act
required of the Borrower under any Loan Document or take any other action which
the Administrative Agent in its discretion deems necessary or desirable to
protect or preserve the Collateral, including, without limitation, any action to
(x) effect any repairs or obtain any insurance called for by the terms of any of
the Loan Documents and to pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the
costs thereof and (y) pay any rents payable by the Borrower which are more than
30 days past due, or as to which the landlord has given notice of termination,
under any lease. The Administrative Agent shall use its best efforts to give the
Borrower notice of any action taken under this Section 9.14 prior to the taking
of such action or promptly thereafter provided the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect thereof. The Borrower
agrees to pay the Administrative Agent, upon demand, the principal amount of all
funds advanced by the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.14, together
with interest thereon at the rate from time to time applicable to Floating Rate
Loans from the date of such advance until the outstanding principal balance
thereof is paid in full. If the Borrower fails to make payment in respect of any
such advance under this Section 9.14 within one (1) Business Day after the date
the Borrower receives written demand therefor from the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender and each Lender agrees
that it shall thereupon make available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars
in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of such advance. If such funds are not made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Lender within one (1) Business Day after the Administrative
Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover
any such amount from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of
such demand and ending on the date such amount is received. The failure of any
Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of any
such unreimbursed advance under this Section 9.14 shall neither relieve any
other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative

                                       74
<PAGE>

Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such advance on the date such
payment is to be made nor increase the obligation of any other Lender to make
such payment to the Administrative Agent. All outstanding principal of, and
interest on, advances made under this Section 9.14 shall constitute Obligations
secured by the Collateral until paid in full by the Borrower.

         9.15. USA Patriot Act Notification. The following notification is
provided to the Borrower pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001,
31 U.S.C. Section 5318:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the
government of the United States of America fight the funding of terrorism and
money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to
obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each Person that opens an
account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other
extension of credit, or other financial services product. Accordingly, when the
Borrower opens an account, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders will ask for
the Borrower's name, tax identification number, business address, and other
information that will allow the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to identify
the Borrower. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may also ask to see the
Borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

                                   ARTICLE X
                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         10.1. Appointment; Nature of Relationship. MSSF is hereby appointed by
each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the
"Administrative Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each
of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the
contractual representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. MS&Co. is hereby appointed by
each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the
"Collateral Agent" and, together with the Administrative Agent, the "Agents")
hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders
irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. Each of the Agents agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined terms "Administrative Agent" and
"Collateral Agent," it is expressly understood and agreed that the Agents shall
not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any of the Holders of the Obligations
by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the Agents are
merely acting as the contractual representatives of the Lenders with only those
duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, each of
the Agents (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Holders
of the Obligations, (ii) is a "representative" of the Holders of the Obligations
within the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined in the New York
Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the
rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders, for itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates as Holders of the Obligations, hereby agrees to assert
no claim against either of the Agents on any agency theory or any other theory
of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Holder of
the Obligations hereby waives.

                                       75
<PAGE>

         10.2. Powers. Each of the Agents shall have and may exercise such
powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to Agent by the
terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Neither Agent shall have any implied duties or fiduciary duties to the
Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except
any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the such
Agent.

         10.3. General Immunity. Neither Agent nor any of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, or any
Lender or Holder of the Obligations for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined
in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, Etc. Neither Agent nor any
of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any
statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document
or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly
to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV,
except, in the case of the Administrative Agent, receipt of items required to be
delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (d) the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value,
sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any Collateral; or
(g) the financial condition of the Borrower or any guarantor of any of the
Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such guarantor's respective
Subsidiaries. Neither Agent shall have any duty to disclose to the Lenders
information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to such Agent
at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to such Agent (either
in its capacity as such Agent or in its individual capacity).

         10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders. Each Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under
any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in the event that and to the extent that
this Agreement expressly requires such), and such instructions and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.
The Lenders hereby acknowledge that neither Agent shall be under any duty to
take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be
requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in
the event that and to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires such).
Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost
and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

                                       76
<PAGE>

         10.6. Employment of Agents and Counsel. Each Agent may execute any of
its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. Each Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between such Agent and the
Lenders and all matters pertaining to such Agent's duties hereunder and under
any other Loan Document.

         10.7. Reliance on Documents; Counsel. Each Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex, electronic mail message, statement, paper or document believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel
selected by such Agent, which counsel may be employees of such Agent. For
purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.1,
each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to,
approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter
required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from such Lender prior to the applicable date specifying its objection
thereto.

         10.8. Agents' Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
ratably in proportion to the Lenders' Pro Rata Shares (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which such Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
such Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by such Agent in
connection with any dispute between such Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against such Agent in connection with any
dispute between such Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the
Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any
such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent and (ii) any indemnification
required pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the
provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall
survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         10.9. Notice of Default. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless such Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the

                                       77
<PAGE>

Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

         10.10. Rights as a Lender. In the event either Agent is a Lender, such
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Advances as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when an Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include such Agent in its individual capacity. Either Agent
and their respective Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. Neither
Agent, in its individual capacity, is obligated to remain a Lender.

         10.11. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Lead Arrangers or any other Lender and based on the financial
statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         10.12. Successor Agents. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such
resignation to be effective (x) twenty (20) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign, if the
Administrative Agent resigns due to its determination, in its sole discretion,
that being the Administrative Agent poses a conflict of interest for it or (y)
upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor
Administrative Agent has been appointed, forty-five (45) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. The Administrative
Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written notice
received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to
be (i) subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the
prior written consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld and (ii) effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon
any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative
Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Administrative Agent's
giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Administrative
Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor
Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrative
Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint
any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Administrative
Agent hereunder. If the Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed and no
successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all
the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all
payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all
other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Administrative
Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor
Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor

                                       78
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank or other financial institution
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the
event that there is a successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or the
Administrative Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant
to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement
shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new
Administrative Agent.

                  (b) The Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective (x) twenty (20) days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice
of its intention to resign, if the Collateral Agent resigns due to its
determination, in its sole discretion, that being the Administrative Agent poses
a conflict of interest for it or (y) upon the appointment of a successor
Collateral Agent or, if no successor Collateral Agent has been appointed,
forty-five (45) days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Collateral Agent may be removed at any time with or
without cause by written notice received by the Collateral Agent from the
Required Lenders, such removal to be (i) subject to, so long as no Default has
occurred and is continuing, the prior written consent of the Borrower, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld and (ii) effective on the date specified
by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required
Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the
Lenders, a successor Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the
resigning Collateral Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Collateral Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the
Lenders, a successor Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
the Collateral Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any
Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates as a successor Collateral Agent hereunder.
If the Collateral Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Collateral
Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the
Collateral Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect
of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall
deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Collateral Agent shall be deemed to
be appointed hereunder until such successor Collateral Agent has accepted the
appointment. Any such successor Collateral Agent shall be a commercial bank,
trust company or other financial institution having capital and retained
earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, such successor
Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Collateral

                                       79
<PAGE>

Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Collateral
Agent, the resigning or removed Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the
effectiveness of the resignation or removal of a Collateral Agent, the
provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
Collateral Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was acting as the Collateral Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

         10.13. Administrative Agent and Lead Arrangers Fees. The Borrower
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers, for their
respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lead Arrangers pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated
September 3, 2004, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

         10.14. Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree
that each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may delegate any
of its respective duties under this Agreement to any of its respective
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which such Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

         10.15. Co-Agents, Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent, Etc. None of
the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a "co-agent",
"documentation agent" or "syndication agent" shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than
those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of
such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such
Lenders as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent in Section 10.11.

         10.16. Collateral Documents. (a) Each Lender authorizes the Collateral
Agent to enter into each of the Collateral Documents to which it is a party and
to take all action contemplated by such documents. Each Lender agrees that no
Holder of the Obligations (other than the Collateral Agent) shall have the right
individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any Collateral
Document, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be
exercised solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the
Obligations upon the terms of the Collateral Documents.

                  (b) In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by
any Person as collateral security for the Obligations, the Collateral Agent is
hereby authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of the Holders of the
Obligations any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a
Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the
Holders of the Obligations.

                  (c) The Lenders hereby authorize the Collateral Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the
Collateral Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments and
payment and satisfaction of all of the Obligations (other than contingent
indemnity obligations and Rate Management Obligations) at any time arising under
or in respect of this Agreement or the Loan Documents or the transactions

                                       80
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby or thereby; (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance
with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved,
authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release
is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the
Collateral Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral
Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to
this Section 10.16.

                  (d) Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting
Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or
consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as
applicable, and upon at least five Business Days' prior written request by the
Borrower to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be
necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Holders of the Obligations herein or pursuant hereto upon
the Collateral that was sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i) the
Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms
which, in the Collateral Agent's opinion, would expose the Collateral Agent to
liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the
release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall
not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon
(or obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of) all interests
retained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, including (without limitation) the
proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the
Collateral.

         10.17. Supplemental Collateral Agent. Anything contained herein or in
the Collateral Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative
Agent may from time to time, when the Administrative Agent deems it necessary,
appoint one or more trustees, co-trustees, collateral co-agents or collateral
subagents (each a "Supplemental Collateral Agent") with respect to all or any
part of the Real Property Collateral. In the event that the Administrative Agent
so appoints any Supplemental Collateral Agent with respect to any Real Property
Collateral, (i) such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall automatically be
vested, in addition to the Administrative Agent, with all rights, powers,
privileges, interests and remedies of the Administrative Agent under the
Collateral Documents with respect to such Real Property Collateral; (ii) such
Supplemental Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be an "Agent" for purposes of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of Section 9.1
of the Security Agreement, this Article and Section 9.6 hereof that refer to the
Agents (or either of them) shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental
Collateral Agent, and all references therein and in the other Loan Documents to
the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative
Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require; and
(iii) the term "Administrative Agent," when used herein or in any applicable
Collateral Document in relation to the Liens on or security interests in such
Real Property Collateral granted in favor of the Administrative Agent, and any
rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Administrative Agent
with respect to such Real Property Collateral, shall be deemed to include such
Supplemental Collateral Agent; provided, however, that no such Supplemental
Collateral Agent shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any such
Real Property Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in
writing by the Administrative Agent. Should any instrument in writing from the
Borrower or any other Credit Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral
Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent to more fully or certainly vest
in and confirming to such Supplemental Collateral Agent such rights, powers,

                                       81
<PAGE>

privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Credit Party to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon
request by the Administrative Agent. If any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or
successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed,
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent, to the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in and be
exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new
Supplemental Collateral Agent.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1. Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any other Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all
account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

         11.2. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a
participation in the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase
each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share. If any Lender, whether in connection
with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares. In case any such payment is
disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall
be made.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         12.1. Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower shall not have the right to
assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior
written consent of each Lender, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made
in compliance with Section 12.3, and (iii) any transfer by Participation must be
made in compliance with Section 12.2. Any attempted assignment or transfer by
any party not made in compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null and void,
unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in
accordance with Section 12.3.2. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this
Section 12.1 does not prohibit assignments creating security interests,
including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank, (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or

                                       82
<PAGE>

assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note
to its Administrative Agent in support of its obligations to its Administrative
Agent or (z) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and any Note to direct or indirect contractual
counterparties in swap agreements relating to the Loans; provided, however, that
no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties
thereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3. The Administrative
Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the
owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with
Section 12.3; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may in its
discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person
which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such
Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any
Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any
Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been
issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent
holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         12.2. Participations.

                  12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Loans of such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, or any
other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder
of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan
Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
the Loan Documents.

                  12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right
to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification
or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver with respect to any Advance in which such Participant has
an interest which would require consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the
terms of Section 8.2 or of any other Loan Document.

                  12.2.3 Benefit of Certain Provisions. The Borrower agrees that
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section
11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each
Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders
agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any
amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to

                                       83
<PAGE>

be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.
The Borrower further agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3,
provided that (i) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating
interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest
for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is
made with the prior written consent of the Borrower, and (ii) any Participant
not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any State
thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5 to the same extent
as if it were a Lender.

         12.3. Assignments.

                  12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may at any time
assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of
its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be
evidenced by an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such
other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto (each such agreement, an
"Assignment Agreement"). Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which
is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be
in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and/or Loans, as
applicable, of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than
$1,000,000. The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment and/or
outstanding Loans (if the Commitment has been terminated), as applicable,
subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of
the "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment Agreement.

                  12.3.2 Consents. The consent of the Borrower shall be required
prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the consent of the
Borrower shall not be required if (i) a Default has occurred and is continuing,
(ii) if such assignment is in connection with the physical settlement of any
Lender's obligations to direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements relating to the Loans or (iii) if such assignment is made in
connection with the primary syndication of the Loans and commitments hereunder.
The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment
becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
an Approved Fund. Any consent required under this Section 12.3.2 shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  12.3.3 Effect; Effective Date. Upon delivery to the
Administrative Agent of an Assignment Agreement, together with any consents
required by Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2, such assignment shall become effective
on the effective date specified in such assignment. The Assignment Agreement
shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the
consideration used to make the purchase of the Loans under the applicable
Assignment Agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that
the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will
not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such
assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders

                                       84
<PAGE>

and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the
transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Loans assigned to such
Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or
the Administrative Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the
applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2.
Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
12.3.3, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall,
if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by
Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate,
replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender, if applicable, and new
Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in
each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments (or, if
the Commitments have been terminated, outstanding Loans), as adjusted pursuant
to such assignment.

                  12.3.4 Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for
this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Loan Commitments of, and
principal amounts of the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  12.3.5 Borrower Increased Costs. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if solely and directly as a result
of any assignment or transfer effected by a Lender under this Agreement, there
arises or will arise any obligation on the part of the Borrower under Article
III of this Agreement to pay any sum in excess of the sum (if any) which, but
for such assignment or transfer, it would have been obliged to pay to such
Lender as an additional amount under Article III, the Borrower shall not be
obliged to pay such excess.

         12.4. Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including

                                       85
<PAGE>

without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided that each
Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this
Agreement.

         12.5. Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

                                   LITIGATION

Headwaters:

1.       Boynton, et al v. Headwaters, Inc. et al, U.S. Dist. Ct. W.D. Tenn.,
         Civ. No. 1-02-1111, filed 2002.

         In October 1998, Headwaters entered into a technology purchase
         agreement with James G. Davidson and Adtech, Inc. The transaction
         transferred certain patent and royalty rights to Headwaters related to
         a synthetic fuel technology invented by Davidson. (This technology is
         distinct from the technology developed by Headwaters.) This action is
         factually related to an earlier action brought by certain purported
         officers and directors of Adtech, Inc. That action was dismissed by the
         United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee and
         the District Court's order of dismissal was affirmed on appeal. In the
         current action, the allegations arise from the same facts, but the
         claims are asserted by certain purported stockholders of Adtech. In
         June 2002, Headwaters received a summons and complaint from the United
         States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee alleging,
         among other things, fraud, conspiracy, constructive trust, conversion,
         patent infringement and interference with contract arising out of the
         1998 technology purchase agreement entered into between Davidson and
         Adtech on the one hand, and Headwaters on the other. The complaint
         seeks declaratory relief and compensatory damages in the approximate
         amount of $10 million and punitive damages. The District Court has
         dismissed all claims against Headwaters except conspiracy and
         constructive trust. The case is set for trial in November 2004.

2.       AGTC v. Headwaters Incorporated, American Arbitration Association, Salt
         Lake City, Utah, No. 81 181 031 02, filed 2002.

         In March 1996, Headwaters entered into an agreement with AGTC and its
         associates for certain services related to the identification and
         selection of synthetic fuel projects. In March 2002, AGTC filed an
         arbitration demand in Salt Lake City, Utah claiming that it is owed
         commissions under the 1996 agreement for 8% of the revenues received by
         Headwaters from the Port Hodder project. AGTC claims approximate
         damages in a range between $520,000 and $14,000,000. Headwaters asserts
         that AGTC did not perform under the agreement and that the agreement
         was terminated and the disputes were settled in July 1996. Headwaters
         has filed an answer in the arbitration, denying AGTC's claims and has
         asserted counterclaims against AGTC. In July and August 2004, the
         arbitrator held hearings. The arbitrator has asked the parties for
         post-hearing briefs and proposed findings and conclusions.

3.       Headwaters Incorporated v. AJG Financial Services, Inc., Fourth Dist.
         Ct., State of Utah, Civ. No. 000403381, filed 2000.

<PAGE>

         In December 1996, Headwaters entered into a technology license and
         proprietary chemical reagent sale agreement with AJG Financial
         Services, Inc. The agreement called for AJG to pay royalties and to
         purchase proprietary chemical reagent material from Headwaters. In
         October 2000, Headwaters filed a complaint in the Fourth District Court
         for the State of Utah against AJG alleging that it had failed to make
         payments and to perform other obligations under the agreement.
         Headwaters asserts claims including breach of contract, declaratory
         judgment, unjust enrichment and accounting and seeks money damages as
         well as other relief. AJG's answer to the complaint denies Headwaters'
         claims and asserted counterclaims based upon allegations of
         misrepresentation and breach of contract. AJG seeks compensatory
         damages in the approximate amount of $71 million and punitive damages.
         Headwaters denies the allegations of AJG's counterclaims. The case is
         set for trial in January 2005.

4.       EEOC and Chavez et al v. Eldorado Stone, LLC, U.S. Dist. Ct. W.D.
         Wash., Civ. No. CV03-2768P, filed 2003.

         In September 2003, the EEOC filed a complaint in the Federal District
         Court for the Western District of Washington against Eldorado Stone,
         LLC, an affiliated company, and certain individuals alleging sexual
         harassment, retaliation, and constructive discharge in violation of the
         Civil Rights Act, arising out of the operations at a Carnation,
         Washington facility. Six individual former employees joined the lawsuit
         alleging multiple related causes of action. Plaintiffs pray for
         injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.
         Eldorado Stone has filed answers to the complaints, denying liability
         and damages. Plaintiffs have not provided a damages calculation, but
         estimates range between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

5.       McEwan v. Headwaters Incorporated, Fourth Dist. Ct., State of Utah,
         Civ. No. 040401670, filed 2004.

         In 1995, Headwaters granted stock options to a member of its board of
         directors, Lloyd , McEwan. The director resigned from the board in
         1996. Headwaters has declined McEwan's attempts to exercise most of the
         options on grounds that the options terminated. In May 2004, McEwan
         filed a complaint in the Fourth District Court for the State of Utah
         against Headwaters alleging breach of contract, breach of implied
         covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and misrepresentation.
         McEwan seeks declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages in the
         approximate amount of $2,000,000 and punitive damages. Headwaters has
         filed an answer denying McEwan's claims and has asserted counterclaims
         against McEwan. McEwan denies the counterclaims.

Tapco:

1.       Eason Associates Sales Company, Inc. vs. Darin Lee Watson, Evergreene
         Marketing, Inc., John D. Greene, and Franklin Murray Hyatt, North
         Carolina Superior Court, Columbus County, Division Case No. 03CV01428.

         Eason Associate Sales Company, Inc. ("Eason"), a company which formerly
         provided sales representatives to Tapco International Corporation
         ("Tapco International"), filed a claim on November 3, 2003 against two
         former Tapco International individual sales representatives, John D.
         Greene and Franklin Murray Hyatt, seeking compensatory damages in
         excess of $10,000 and punitive damages. Although Tapco International is
         not a named defendant in the suit, Tapco International has an oral
         indemnification agreement with Mr. Greene and Mr. Hyatt and has,
         consequently, undertaken their defense. Although the suit is still
         ongoing, Tapco International believes that the General Release obtained
         from Eason pursuant to settlement of an earlier related lawsuit filed
         by Eason against Tapco International bars this second lawsuit.

2.       Richard Grubola vs. Tapco International Corporation, Wayne County
         Circuit Court, State of Michigan, Case No. 03-318496NZ.

         On June 9, 2003, Richard Grubola, an employee of Tapco International
         who was terminated in 2002, filed an age discrimination complaint.
         Although the claims was denied by the EEOC on March 10, 2003, the
         matter is still ongoing. Mr. Grubola claims compensatory damages in the
         amount of $25,000, exemplary damages in the amount of $25,000 and lost
         wages and benefits, past and future. Tapco International maintains that
         the decision to terminate Mr. Grubola was performance-related.

         District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Case No. 4:04 CV
         0185.

         This litigation involves claims and counterclaims for both patent
         infringement and trade dress claims in connection with certain vent,

         settled in June 2004 pursuant to a settlement agreement under which
         Dinesold Building Products, Ltd. agreed to change its design, the trade
         dress claims are currently being litigated.

5.       Pamela Darling vs. Tapco International Corporation, Michigan Department
         of Civil Rights, Complaint/Charge No. 316048, EEOC 23AA400557C.

         Pamela Darling, a current employee of Tapco International, filed a
         claim of age, gender and disability discrimination against her
         employer. No specific amount of damages have been claimed. On January
         20, 2004, the State of Michigan Department of Civil Rights sent Tapco
         International a notice requesting a response to interrogatories and a
         statement of position with regard to the complaint. Tapco responded to
         this request in a letter dated February 17, 2004. In this letter, Tapco
         International states that no adverse employment action has been taken
         against Ms. Darling and requests that the charge be dismissed with a
         finding of no probable cause.

6.       Metamora

         There is historical contamination at the 4057 South Oak Street,
         Metamora, MI property, which has been the subject of several
         investigations. Initially, the site was targeted for investigation due
         to a disgruntled former employee's 1991 report of illegal disposal of
         hazardous waste drums in a pond on the property that has since been
         filled. Subsequent investigation discredited the employee's claims but
         did turn up modest levels of contaminants at the site. A No Further
         Action ("NFA") letter from the Michigan Department of Environmental
         Quality has been requested. There are presently no estimates of amounts
         of remediation should remediation eventually be required.

7.       Internal Revenue Service audit of Tapco Holdings, Inc. & Subsidiaries
         federal income tax returns for the tax year ended October 31, 2002.

8.       Workers Compensation claims by Brandon Montrull, Anna Hotelling,
         Matthew Little and Pamela Darling.

         California and Texas Guarantors; and

         I. such other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the
         opinions we express below.

         On the basis of the assumptions and subject to the qualifications and
limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

         1. (a) The Company is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware General Corporation Law and has the corporate power to
own and hold under lease the properties it purports to own and hold under lease
and to conduct the business in which it is engaged.

                  (b) The Company has the corporate power to execute and
         deliver, and to perform its obligations under the Agreement, the
         Delivered Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral
         Agreements and for the Company's incurrence of the indebtedness in the
         amount of the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment and the Aggregate
         Term B Loan Commitment (as in effect on the date hereof) and the
         repayment of such indebtedness, with interest, in accordance with the
         terms of the Agreement, and for the grant by the Company of the
         security interest in its Collateral described in Section 1.2 of the
         Pledge and Security Agreement.

                  (c) Each California Guarantor is duly incorporated, validly
         existing and in good standing under the law of California and has the
         corporate power to own and hold under lease the properties it purports
         to own and hold under lease and to conduct the business in which it is
         engaged.

                  (d) Each Texas Guarantor is duly incorporated, validly
         existing and in good standing under the law of Texas and has the
         corporate power to own and hold under lease the properties it purports
         to own and hold under lease and to conduct the business in which it is
         engaged.

                  (e) Each California and Texas Guarantor has the corporate
         power to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the
         Guaranty and for the grant by such Guarantor of the security interest
         in its Collateral described in Section 1.2 of the Pledge and Security
         Agreement.

         2. Each of the Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the
Company, and each Delivered Note will, upon disbursement of the loans evidenced
by such Note, constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company,
in each case enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

<PAGE>

         3. Each of the Guaranty and the Collateral Agreements (a) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Texas and California
Guarantors and (b) constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of each
Guarantor, in each case enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with
its terms.

         4. The execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations under, the Agreement, the Delivered Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements by the Company do not and will not
violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any property of the Company under, the
federal law of the United States of America ("Federal Law") or the law of the
State.

         5. The execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations under, the Guaranty and the Collateral Agreements by each Guarantor
do not and will not violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute
a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any property of such
Guarantor under, Federal Law or the law of the State or, in the case of the
California Guarantors, the law of California or, in the case of the Texas
Guarantors, the law of Texas.

         6. Under Federal Law and the law of the State and, in the case of the
California Guarantors, the law of California and, in the case of the Texas
Guarantors, the law of Texas, no Governmental Approvals are required to have
been obtained, and no Governmental Registrations are required to have been made:

                  (a) by the Company, (i) for the valid execution and delivery
         by the Company of the Agreement, the Delivered Notes, the Intercreditor
         Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, (ii) for the Company's
         incurrence of the indebtedness in the amount of the Aggregate Revolving
         Loan Commitment and the Aggregate Term B Loan Commitment (as in effect
         on the date hereof) and the repayment of such indebtedness, with
         interest, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, or (iii) for
         the grant by the Company of the security interest in its Collateral
         described in Section 1.2 of the Pledge and Security Agreement (such
         security interests, collectively, the "Company Security Interests"); or

                  (b) by any Guarantor, (i) for the valid execution and delivery
         by such Guarantor of the Guaranty or the Collateral Agreements, or (ii)
         for the grant by such Guarantor of the security interest in its
         Collateral described in Section 1.2 of the Pledge and Security
         Agreement (such security interests, collectively, the "Guarantor
         Security Interests" and, together with the Company Security Interests,
         the "Security Interests").

         7. (a) Each of the Security Interests is an enforceable security
interest in the collateral to which it applies.

                  (b) (i) If financing statements in the form attached hereto as
                  Schedule 1A through Schedule 1M are communicated to the
                  Delaware Secretary of State by a method of document delivery
                  authorized under Section 106 of the Administrative Rules of
                  the Delaware Secretary of State and an amount equal to the
                  applicable filing fee is tendered to such filing office, such
                  filing office will have an obligation to accept such financing
                  statements.

                  Guarantor Security Interests granted by the Delaware Guarantor
                  in so much of the Collateral as consists of (in each case as
                  defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) accounts (other than

                  Commercial Code), general intangibles, goods, chattel paper,
                  investment property, negotiable documents and instruments will
                  be perfected.

                           (iii) Such financing statements are all of the

                  recording or other taxes or fees, is required by law to effect
                  such perfection.

                  (c) (i) If financing statements in the form attached hereto as

                           (ii) Upon acceptance of such financing statements by
                  said filing office, the Guarantor Security Interests granted
                  by the California Guarantors in so much of the Collateral as
                  consists of (in each case as defined in the Uniform Commercial
                  Code) accounts (other than accounts described in Section
                  9-102(a)(6)(B) of the Uniform Commercial Code), general
                  intangibles, goods, chattel paper, investment property,

                           (iii) Such financing statements are all of the
                  filings, and are in the form, required to effect such

                           (iv) Except for the filings and fees referred to in

<PAGE>

                  Code) accounts (other than accounts described in Section
                  9-102(a)(6)(B) of the Uniform Commercial Code), general
                  intangibles, goods, chattel paper, investment property,
                  negotiable documents and instruments will be perfected.

                           (iii) Such financing statements are all of the
                  filings, and are in the form, required to effect such
                  perfection.

                  clause (i), no other action, including the payment of any
                  recording or other taxes or fees, is required by law to effect
                  such perfection.

                  (e) (i) The delivery to the First Lien Collateral Agent (as
                  defined in the Agreement) in New York of the certificates (and
                  related stock powers executed in blank) evidencing the
                  Securities listed on Schedule 4 will be effective to perfect
                  the Security Interest in such Securities.

                           (ii) The Security Interest in the Securities listed
                  on Schedule 4, when such certificates are so delivered, will
                  be free of any adverse claim, as defined in Section
                  8-102(a)(1) of the New York Uniform Commercial Code.

         8. To our knowledge, neither the Company nor any Guarantor is a party
in any action, suit or proceeding in which the pleadings request as relief that
(a) any of the obligations of the Company, or any of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, under the Agreement, the Delivered Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, or (b) any of the
obligations of any Guarantor, or any of the rights of the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders, under the Guaranty or the Collateral Agreements, be declared
invalid or subordinated or their performance be enjoined.

         Our opinion is subject to the following qualifications and limitations:

                  1. Our opinion is subject to the effect of (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance and other similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles,
(iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and (iv)
additionally in the case of (A) indemnities, a requirement that facts, known to
the indemnitee but not the indemnitor, in existence at the time the indemnity
becomes effective that would entitle the indemnitee to indemnification be
disclosed to the indemnitor, (B) waivers, Sections 9-602 and 9-603 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, (C) indemnities, waivers and exculpatory provisions,
public policy and (D) restrictions on, or remedies in the event of, assignment
or transfer of rights or interests or the creation, attachment, perfection or
enforcement of security interests, Sections 9-401(b), 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 and
9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Our opinion with respect to the Guaranty
is subject to the further qualification that the Guarantor may be exonerated as
to a guaranteed party if such guaranteed party fails to inform the Guarantor of
material, adverse information, known to it and not to the Guarantor, concerning
the Company or any Collateral.

                  2. The opinions expressed in paragraphs 1(a), 1(c) and 1(d) as
to the due incorporation, valid existence and good standing of the Company, the
California Guarantors and the Texas Guarantors, respectively, are based on
recent good standing certificates and verbal confirmations of good standing as
of September 7, 2004.

<PAGE>

                  3. Certain remedial provisions of the Loan Documents as to
which we are opining may be unenforceable in whole or in part, but the inclusion
of such provisions does not affect the validity of the balance of such Loan
Documents, and the practical realization of the benefits created by such Loan
Documents taken as a whole will not be materially impaired by the
unenforceability of those particular provisions. In addition, certain remedial
provisions of such Loan Documents may be subject to procedural requirements not
set forth therein.

                  4. The Security Interests (i) will not be enforceable with
respect to, or attach to, any Collateral until value has been given and the
Grantor thereof has rights in such Collateral or (ii) be enforceable with
respect to any Collateral (other than the Securities that are the subject of our
opinion in paragraph 7(e)) against the competing interests of those third
parties (other than the Grantor thereof) who would, in accordance with the
provisions of Applicable Law, take free of, or have priority over, such Security
Interest in such Collateral, notwithstanding its perfection.

                  5. Our opinion is limited to the law of the State and Federal
Law, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, except that our opinions
expressed in paragraphs 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) are limited to the Delaware Uniform
Commercial Code, the California Commercial Code and the Texas Uniform Commercial
Code, respectively, and, in each case, to Federal Law.

                  6. Our opinion is intended for the sole benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and their permitted successors and
assignees and permitted participants in or purchasers of the obligations of the
Company under the Loan Documents and no other Person is entitled to rely on it
for any purpose without our prior written consent.

                  7. We express no opinion with respect to:

                           a. the Company's or the Guarantors' rights in, title
                  to or legal or beneficial ownership of any of the Collateral
                  or any Collateral acquired after the date hereof;

                           b. the perfection of the Security Interest in any
                  dividends or other distributions of any Securities that are
                  not the subject of our opinion in paragraph 7(e);

                           c. the priority of the Security Interests in any
                  Collateral or the effect of perfection or nonperfection of the
                  Security Interests in any Collateral of a type referred to in
                  Section 9-301(c) of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (or
                  the equivalent section of the Delaware, California or Texas
                  Uniform Commercial Code) that is not located in the State, the
                  State of California, the State of Delaware, or the State of
                  Texas, as applicable;

                           d. any Collateral that (A) is not governed by Article
                  8 or 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (and not, in the case of
                  Article 9, excluded therefrom by Section 9-109(c) or (d)) or
                  (B) is subject to a certificate of title or (C) is a
                  trademark;

                           e. Section 15.2 of the Agreement and the equivalent
                  sections in the other Loan Documents insofar as said sections
                  relate to federal courts (except as to the personal
                  jurisdiction thereof); and

<PAGE>

                           f. the definition of Collateral contained in the
                  Pledge and Security Agreement to the extent the same purports
                  to make (A) commercial tort claims part of the Collateral by
                  using general terms such as "currently existing commercial
                  tort claims" or (B) any other assets part of the Collateral by
                  using general terms such as "any property of the Grantors", in
                  each case without further specificity; provided that the
                  foregoing shall not in any way limit our opinions in
                  paragraphs 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) in respect of (i) commercial
                  tort claims which are specifically listed in the definition of
                  Collateral (directly or by reference to a schedule or exhibit)
                  or (ii) any property which is specifically referenced by type
                  in the definition of Collateral.

         In rendering our opinion:

                  1. We have, without independent verification, relied, with
respect to factual matters, statements and conclusions, on certificates and
statements of governmental officials and officials of the Company and the
Guarantors and on the representations made by the Company and the Guarantors in
the Loan Documents.

                  2. We have examined originals, or copies of originals
certified, conformed or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such
agreements, documents and records as we have considered relevant and necessary
as a basis for this opinion.

                  3 We have assumed the accuracy and completeness of all, and
the authenticity of all original, certificates, agreements, documents, records
and other materials submitted to us, the conformity with the originals of any
copies submitted to us, the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity
of all natural persons.

                  4. We have assumed that:

                           (a) (i) the execution and delivery of, and the
                           performance of its obligations under, the Agreement
                           and the Collateral Agreements by the Company do not
                           and will not (A) require any Governmental Approval or

         in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation; that
         each such other party has the requisite corporate or other

         each of them constitutes the legally valid and binding obligations of,
         such other parties, as applicable, enforceable against such other
         parties in accordance with their respective terms;

                  (iii) that [Borrower/Mortgagor] is duly incorporated, validly

         record in the real property portions of the Mortgaged Property owned by

                  (ix) [**FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: that the

                                    Opinions

         On the basis of such examination, our reliance upon the assumptions
contained herein and our consideration of those questions of law we considered
relevant, and subject to the limitations and qualifications in this opinion, we
are of the opinion that:

                  1. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] constitutes the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of [Borrower/Mortgagor], enforceable against
         [Borrower/Mortgagor] in accordance with its terms.

                  2. The execution and delivery of the Subject Documents, the
         performance by [Borrower/Mortgagor] of its obligations thereunder and
         the compliance with the terms and conditions thereof by
         [Borrower/Mortgagor] are not in contravention of or in conflict with
         any law, rule or regulation of the State applicable to
         [Borrower/Mortgagor].

                  3. The execution and delivery by [Borrower/Mortgagor] of the
         Subject Documents to which it is a party and the performance of
         [Borrower/Mortgagor]'s obligations thereunder do not require any
         governmental consents, approvals, authorizations, permits,
         registrations, declarations or filings or other action or any notices
         to, consents of, orders of or filings with any governmental authority
         or regulatory body of the State (including those having jurisdiction
         over the enforcement of the environmental laws of the State), except
         for the recordation of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] [** FOR MICHIGAN,
         GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: and the Fixture Filings**] in the
         respective recording offices described herein.

                  4. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] (including the
         acknowledgement, attestation, seal and witness requirements) is in
         appropriate form for recordation in the State.

                  5. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] is in proper form sufficient
         to create a valid [mortgage/deed of trust lien] in favor of Collateral
         Agent on, and to vest [Trustee and] Agent with power of sale in, such

<PAGE>

         of the Mortgaged Property described therein that constitutes real
         property (including fixtures, to the extent the same constitute real
         property). The recordation of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] in the [**
         NAME APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE**] are the only recordation,
         filings or registrations necessary to perfect the liens on the
         Mortgaged Property created by the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] [** FOR
         MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA:, except for the filing with the
         ** NAME APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE** of the Fixture Filings
         regarding that portion of the Mortgaged Property constituting
         fixtures**]. Upon recordation of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] in the
         [** NAME APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE**], [Trustee/Collateral
         Agent] will have valid and perfected [mortgage/deed of trust liens] on
         the Mortgaged Property described therein. No other recordation, filing,
         re-recordation or re-filing is necessary in order to perfect or to
         maintain the priority of the liens created by the [Mortgages/Deeds of
         Trust].

                  6. The real property descriptions attached to the
         [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] are in form legally sufficient for the
         purpose of subjecting that portion of the Mortgaged Property that
         constitutes real property to the liens evidenced by the
         [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust][** FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA:
         and the Fixture Filings**].

                  7. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] is in proper form sufficient
         to constitute a valid and effective fixture filing with respect to the
         Pic,, rises under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect
         in the State naming [Borrower/Mortgagor] as debtor and Agent as secured
         party.

                  8. Collateral Agent is not required to qualify to transact
         business in the State nor will Collateral Agent incur any tax imposed
         by the State (including, without limitation, any tax imposed by the
         State on interest or on revenue paid in respect of the Credit
         Agreements), solely as the result of the ownership or recordation of
         the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust]

                  9. [**FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: The Fixture
         Filings are in appropriate form for recordation in the State.**]

                  10. [**FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: With respect
         to that portion of the Mortgaged Property in which a security interest
         may be perfected by the recordation of a fixture filing in the State

<PAGE>

         (the "Fixtures"), the proper place to file the Fixture Filings is in
         the [LIST APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE] (the "Filing Office"),
         and no filing or recordation in any other place is necessary under the
         UCC to perfect a security interest in the Fixtures. Upon the
         recordation of the Fixture Filings with the Filing Office, Agent will
         have a perfected security interest in the Fixtures. Subsequent to the
         recordation of the Fixture Filings in accordance with the procedures

                                 Qualifications

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications, limitations
and exceptions:

                  1. Qualifying paragraph 1 above, the enforceability of the
         [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] and the liens created thereby may be limited
         or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
         similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including, without
         limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws) and by general principles of
         equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality,
         reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible
         unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless
         of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. The
         aforesaid opinion as to enforceability of the [Mortgages/Deeds of
         Trust] is also subject to the qualification that certain provisions
         contained therein may not be enforceable, but (subject to the
         limitations set forth in the foregoing sentence) such unenforceability
         will not render the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] invalid as a whole or
         substantially interfere with realization of the principal benefits
         and/or security provided thereby.

                  2. In rendering the opinions expressed in this opinion letter,
         we have made no examination of and express no opinion with respect to:
         (i) title to or, except as to adequacy of form, descriptions of the
         Mortgaged Property described in the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust]; (ii)
         the nature or extent of [Borrower/Mortgagor]'s rights in, or title to,
         the Mortgaged Property; (iii) the existence or non-existence of liens,
         security interests, charges or encumbrances thereon or therein actually
         of record; or (iv) the priority of any liens on any part of the
         Mortgaged Property. We have not independently certified the existence,
         condition, location or ownership of any of the Mortgaged Property.

         This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any
obligation to update this opinion letter for events occurring after the date of
this opinion letter. The foregoing opinion applies only with respect to the laws
of the State and the federal laws of the United States of America and we express
no opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction.

when due under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall

         Section 3.5 Inspection. Grantor shall permit Beneficiary and the other
Lender Parties and their respective agents, representatives and employees, upon
reasonable prior notice to Grantor, to inspect the Mortgaged Property and all
books and records of Grantor located thereon, and to conduct such environmental

provided that such inspections and studies shall not materially interfere with
the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property.

         Section 3.6 Other Covenants. All of the covenants in the Credit
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and, together with covenants in
this Article 3, shall be covenants running with the Land.

         Section 3.7 Insurance; Condemnation Awards and Insurance Proceeds.

financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to the
Mortgaged Property against loss or damage of the kinds customarily carried or
maintained under similar circumstances by corporations of established reputation
engaged in similar businesses. Each such policy of insurance shall name
Beneficiary as the loss payee (or, in the case of liability insurance, an
additional insured) thereunder for the ratable benefit of the Lender Parties,
shall (except in the case of liability insurance) name Beneficiary as the
"mortgagee" under a so-called "New York" long form non-contributory endorsement

modification or cancellation of such policy. In addition to the foregoing, if
any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located in an area identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards and
in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 (or any amendment or successor act thereto), then Grantor
shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, with a financially sound and
reputable insurer, flood insurance in an amount sufficient to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to such Act.

         (b) Condemnation Awards. Grantor assigns all Condemnation Awards to
Beneficiary and authorizes Beneficiary to collect and receive such Condemnation
Awards and to give proper receipts and acquittances therefor, subject to the
terms of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.2(b)
thereof).

         (c) Insurance Proceeds. Grantor assigns to Beneficiary all proceeds of
any insurance policies insuring against loss or damage to the Mortgaged
Property. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 2.2(b) thereof), Grantor authorizes Beneficiary to collect
and receive such proceeds and authorizes and directs the issuer of each of such
insurance policies to make payment for all such losses directly to Beneficiary,
instead of to Grantor and Beneficiary jointly.

                             [Intentionally Omitted]

                                    ARTICLE 5
                             DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE

         Section 5.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary's election and by or
through Trustee or otherwise, exercise any or all of the following rights,
remedies and recourses:

         (a) Acceleration. Subject to any provisions of the Loan Documents
providing for the automatic acceleration of the Indebtedness upon the occurrence
of certain Events of Default, declare the Indebtedness to be immediately due and
payable, without further notice, presentment, protest, notice of intent to
accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand or action of any nature whatsoever
(each of which hereby is expressly waived by Grantor), whereupon the same shall
become immediately due and payable.

         (b) Entry on Mortgaged Property. Enter the Mortgaged Property and take
exclusive possession thereof and of all books, records and accounts relating
thereto or located thereon. If Grantor remains in possession of the Mortgaged
Property following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and without Beneficiary's prior written consent, Beneficiary may invoke
any legal remedies to dispossess Grantor.

         (c) Operation of Mortgaged Property. Hold, lease, develop, manage,
operate or otherwise use the Mortgaged Property upon such terms and conditions
as Beneficiary may deem reasonable under the circumstances (making such repairs,
alterations, additions and improvements and taking other actions, from time to
time, as Beneficiary deems necessary or desirable), and apply all Rents and
other amounts collected by Trustee or Beneficiary in connection therewith in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7.

         (d) Foreclosure and Sale. Institute proceedings for the complete
foreclosure of this Deed of Trust by judicial action or by power of sale, in
which case the Mortgaged Property may be sold for cash or credit in one or more
parcels as Beneficiary may determine. With respect to any notices required or
permitted under the UCC, Grantor agrees that ten (10) days' prior written notice
shall be deemed commercially reasonable. At any such sale by virtue of any
judicial proceedings, power of sale, or any other legal right, remedy or
recourse, the title to and right of possession of any such property shall pass
to the purchaser thereof, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantor
shall be completely and irrevocably divested of all of its right, title,
interest, claim, equity, equity of redemption, and demand whatsoever, either at
law or in equity, in and to the property sold and such sale shall be a perpetual
bar both at law and in equity against Grantor, and against all other Persons
claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof, by, through or under
Grantor. Beneficiary or any of the other Lender Parties may be a purchaser at
such sale. If Beneficiary or such other Lender Party is the highest bidder,
Beneficiary or such other Lender Party may credit the portion of the purchase
price that would be distributed to Beneficiary or such other Lender Party
against the Indebtedness in lieu of paying cash. In the event this Deed of Trust
is foreclosed by judicial action, appraisement of the Mortgaged Property is
waived.

         (e) Receiver. Make application to a court of competent jurisdiction
for, and obtain from such court as a matter of strict right and without notice
to Grantor or regard to the adequacy of the Mortgaged Property for the repayment
of the Indebtedness, the appointment of a receiver of the Mortgaged Property,
and Grantor irrevocably consents to such appointment. Any such receiver shall
have all the usual powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including

<PAGE>

the full power to rent, maintain and otherwise operate the Mortgaged Property
upon such terms as may be approved by the court, and shall apply such Rents in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7.

         (f) Other. Exercise all other rights, remedies and recourses granted
under the Loan Documents or otherwise available at law or in equity.

         Section 5.2 Separate Sales. The Mortgaged Property may be sold in one
or more parcels and in such manner and order as Trustee in its sole discretion
may elect. The right of sale arising out of any Event of Default shall not be
exhausted by any one or more sales.

         Section 5.3 Remedies Cumulative, Concurrent and Nonexclusive. Trustee,
Beneficiary and the other Lender Parties shall have all rights, remedies and
recourses granted in the Loan Documents and available at law or equity
(including the UCC), which rights (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b)
may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against Grantor or
others obligated under the Loan Documents, or against the Mortgaged Property, or
against any one or more of them, at the sole discretion of Trustee, Beneficiary
or such other Lender Party, as the case may be, (c) may be exercised as often as
occasion therefor shall arise, and the exercise or failure to exercise any of
them shall not be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other
right, remedy or recourse, and (d) are intended to be, and shall be,
nonexclusive. No action by Trustee, Beneficiary or any other Lender Party in the
enforcement of any rights, remedies or recourses under the Loan Documents or
otherwise at law or equity shall be deemed to cure any Event of Default.

         Section 5.4 Release of and Resort to Collateral. Beneficiary may
release, regardless of consideration and without the necessity for any notice to
or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien on the Mortgaged Property, any
part of the Mortgaged Property without, as to the remainder, in any way
impairing, affecting, subordinating or releasing the lien or security interest
created in or evidenced by the Loan Documents or their status as a first and
prior lien and security interest in and to the Mortgaged Property. For payment
of the Indebtedness, Beneficiary may resort to any other security in such order
and manner as Beneficiary may elect.

         Section 5.5 Waiver of Redemption, Notice and Marshalling of Assets. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and releases (a) all benefit that might accrue to Grantor
by virtue of any present or future statute of limitations or law or judicial
decision exempting the Mortgaged Property from attachment, levy or sale on
execution or providing for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process,
redemption or extension of time for payment, (b) all notices of any Event of
Default or of any election by Trustee or Beneficiary to exercise or the actual
exercise of any right, remedy or recourse provided for under the Loan Documents,
and (c) any right to a marshalling of assets or a sale in inverse order of
alienation.

         Section 5.6 Discontinuance of Proceedings. If Trustee, Beneficiary or
any other Lender Party shall have proceeded to invoke any right, remedy or
recourse permitted under the Loan Documents and shall thereafter elect to
discontinue or abandon it for any reason, Trustee, Beneficiary or such other
Lender Party, as the case may be, shall have the unqualified right to do so and,
in such an event, Grantor, Trustee, Beneficiary and the other Lender Parties
shall be restored to their former positions with respect to the Indebtedness,
the Obligations, the Loan Documents, the Mortgaged Property and otherwise, and
the rights, remedies, recourses and powers of Trustee, Beneficiary and the other
Lender Parties shall continue as if the right, remedy or recourse had never been

<PAGE>

invoked, but no such discontinuance or abandonment shall waive any Event of
Default which may then exist or the right of Trustee, Beneficiary or any other
Lender Party thereafter to exercise any right, remedy or recourse under the Loan
Documents for such Event of Default.

         Section 5.7 Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale
of, and the Rents and other amounts generated by the holding, leasing,
management, operation or other use of the Mortgaged Property, shall be applied
by Beneficiary or Trustee (or the receiver, if one is appointed) in the
following order unless otherwise required by applicable law:

         (a) to the payment of the costs and expenses of taking possession of
the Mortgaged Property and of holding, using, leasing, repairing, improving and
selling the same, including, without limitation (1) trustee's and receiver's
fees and expenses, including the repayment of the amounts evidenced by any
receiver's certificates, (2) court costs, (3) attorneys' and accountants' fees
and expenses, and (4) costs of advertisement;

         (b) to the payment of the Indebtedness and performance of the
Obligations in such manner and order of preference as Beneficiary in its sole
discretion may determine; and

         (c) the balance, if any, to the Persons legally entitled thereto.

         Section 5.8 Occupancy After Foreclosure. Any sale of the Mortgaged
Property or any part thereof in accordance with Section 5.1(d) will divest all
right, title and interest of Grantor in and to the property sold. Subject to
applicable law, any purchaser at a foreclosure sale will receive immediate
possession of the property purchased. If Grantor retains possession of such
property or any part thereof subsequent to such sale, Grantor will be considered
a tenant at sufferance of the purchaser, and will, if Grantor remains in
possession after demand to remove, be subject to eviction and removal, forcible
or otherwise, with or without process of law.

         Section 5.9 Additional Advances and Disbursements; Costs of
Enforcement.

         (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, Beneficiary and each of the other Lender Parties shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to cure such Event of Default in the name and on behalf
of Grantor. All sums advanced and expenses incurred at any time by Beneficiary
or any other Lender Party under this Section 5.9, or otherwise under this Deed
of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents or applicable law, shall bear
interest from the date that such sum is advanced or expense incurred, to and
including the date of reimbursement, computed at the highest rate at which
interest is then computed on any portion of the Indebtedness, and all such sums,
together with interest thereon, shall be secured by this Deed of Trust.

         (b) Grantor shall pay all expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) of or incidental to the perfection and enforcement of this
Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, or the enforcement, compromise or
settlement of the Indebtedness or any claim under this Deed of Trust and the
other Loan Documents, and for the curing thereof, or for defending or asserting
the rights and claims of Beneficiary in respect thereof, by litigation or
otherwise.

         Section 5.10 No Mortgagee in Possession. Neither the enforcement of any
of the remedies under this Article 5, the assignment of the Rents and Leases
under Article 6, the security interests under Article 7, nor any other remedies
afforded to Beneficiary under the Loan Documents, at law or in equity shall
cause Trustee, Beneficiary or any other Lender Party to be deemed or construed

<PAGE>

to be a mortgagee in possession of the Mortgaged Property, to obligate Trustee,
Beneficiary or any other Lender Party to lease the Mortgaged Property or attempt
to do so, or to take any action, incur any expense, or perform or discharge any
obligation, duty or liability whatsoever under any of the Leases or otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE 6
                         ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

         Section 6.1 Assignment. In furtherance of and in addition to the
assignment made by Grantor in Section 2.1 of this Deed of Trust, Grantor hereby
absolutely and unconditionally assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to Trustee
(for the benefit of Beneficiary) and to Beneficiary all of its right, title and
interest in and to all Leases, whether now existing or hereafter entered into,
and all of its right, title and interest in and to all Rents. This assignment is
an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. So
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Grantor shall
have a revocable license from Trustee and Beneficiary to exercise all rights
extended to the landlord under the Leases, including the right to receive and
collect all Rents and to hold the Rents in trust for use in the payment and
performance of the Obligations and to otherwise use the same. The foregoing
license is granted subject to the conditional limitation that no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, whether or not legal proceedings have
commenced, and without regard to waste, adequacy of security for the Obligations
or solvency of Grantor, the license herein granted shall automatically expire
and terminate, without notice to Grantor by Trustee or Beneficiary (any such
notice being hereby expressly waived by Grantor to the extent permitted by
applicable law).

         Section 6.2 Perfection Upon Recordation. Grantor acknowledges that
Beneficiary and Trustee have taken all actions necessary to obtain, and that
upon recordation of this Deed of Trust Beneficiary and Trustee shall have, to
the extent permitted under applicable law, a valid and fully perfected, first
priority, present assignment of the Rents arising out of the Leases and all
security for such Leases. Grantor acknowledges and agrees that upon recordation
of this Deed of Trust Trustee's and Beneficiary's interest in the Rents shall be
deemed to be fully perfected, "choate" and enforced as to Grantor and to the
extent permitted under applicable law, all third parties, including, without
limitation, any subsequently appointed trustee in any case under Title 11 of the
United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), without the necessity of commencing
a foreclosure action with respect to this Deed of Trust, making formal demand
for the Rents, obtaining the appointment of a receiver or taking any other
affirmative action.

         Section 6.3 Bankruptcy Provisions. Without limitation of the absolute
nature of the assignment of the Rents hereunder, Grantor, Trustee and
Beneficiary agree that (a) this Deed of Trust shall constitute a "security
agreement" for purposes of Section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) the
security interest created by this Deed of Trust extends to property of Grantor
acquired before the commencement of a case in bankruptcy and to all amounts paid
as Rents and (c) such security interest shall extend to all Rents acquired by
the estate after the commencement of any case in bankruptcy.

         Section 6.4 No Merger of Estates. So long as part of the Indebtedness
and the Obligations secured hereby remain unpaid and undischarged, the fee and
leasehold estates to the Mortgaged Property shall not merge, but shall remain
separate and distinct, notwithstanding the union of such estates either in
Grantor, Beneficiary, any tenant or any third party by purchase or otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                               SECURITY AGREEMENT

         Section 7.1 Security Interest. This Deed of Trust constitutes a
"security agreement" on personal property within the meaning of the UCC and
other applicable law and with respect to the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases,
Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance
and Condemnation Awards. To this end, Grantor grants to Beneficiary a first and
prior security interest in the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Deposit
Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance, Condemnation
Awards and all other Mortgaged Property which is personal property to secure the
payment of the Indebtedness and performance of the Obligations, and agrees that
Beneficiary shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the
UCC with respect to such property. Any notice of sale, disposition or other
intended action by Beneficiary with respect to the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases,
Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance
and Condemnation Awards sent to Grantor at least ten (10) days prior to any
action under the UCC shall constitute reasonable notice to Grantor. In the event
of any inconsistency between the terms of this Deed of Trust and the terms of
the Security Agreement with respect to the collateral covered both therein and
herein, the Security Agreement shall control and govern to the extent of any
such inconsistency.

         Section 7.2 Financing Statements. Grantor shall prepare and deliver to
Beneficiary such financing statements, and shall execute and deliver to
Beneficiary such other documents, instruments and further assurances, in each
case in form and substance satisfactory to Beneficiary, as Beneficiary may, from
time to time, reasonably consider necessary to create, perfect and preserve
Beneficiary's security interest hereunder. Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes
Beneficiary to cause financing statements (and amendments thereto and
continuations thereof) and any such documents, instruments and assurances to be
recorded and filed, at such times and places as may be required or permitted by
law to so create, perfect and preserve such security interest. Grantor
represents and warrants to Beneficiary that Grantor's jurisdiction of
organization is the State of [________________]. After the date of this Deed of
Trust, Grantor shall not change its name, type of organization, organizational
identification number (if any), jurisdiction of organization or location (within
the meaning of the UCC) without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written
notice to Beneficiary.

         Section 7.3 Fixture Filing. This Deed of Trust shall also constitute a
"fixture filing" for the purposes of the UCC against all of the Mortgaged
Property which is or is to become fixtures. The information provided in this
Section 7.3 is provided so that this Deed of Trust shall comply with the
requirements of the UCC for a mortgage instrument to be filed as a financing
statement. Grantor is the "Debtor" and its name and mailing address are set
forth in the preamble of this Deed of Trust immediately preceding Article 1.
Beneficiary is the "Secured Party" and its name and mailing address from which
information concerning the security interest granted herein may be obtained are
also set forth in the preamble of this Deed of Trust immediately preceding
Article 1. A statement describing the portion of the Mortgaged Property
comprising the fixtures hereby secured is set forth in Section 1.1(c) of this
Deed of Trust. Grantor represents and warrants to Beneficiary that Grantor is
the record owner of the Mortgaged Property, the employer identification number
of Grantor is [_____________] and the organizational identification number of
Grantor is [____________].

                                    ARTICLE 8
                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

<PAGE>

         Section 8.1 Certain Rights. With the approval of Beneficiary, Trustee
shall have the right to select, employ and consult with counsel. Trustee shall
have the right to rely on any instrument, document or signature authorizing or
supporting any action taken or proposed to be taken by it hereunder, believed by
it in good faith to be genuine. Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement for
actual, reasonable expenses incurred by it in the performance of its duties and
to reasonable compensation for Trustee's services hereunder as shall be
rendered. Grantor shall, from time to time, pay the compensation due to Trustee
hereunder and reimburse Trustee for, and indemnify, defend and save Trustee
harmless against, all liability and reasonable expenses which may be incurred by
it in the performance of its duties, including those arising from joint,
concurrent, or comparative negligence of Trustee; provided, however, that
Grantor shall not be liable under such indemnification to the extent such
liability or expenses result solely from Trustee's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Grantor's obligations under this Section 8.1 shall not be reduced or
impaired by principles of comparative or contributory negligence.

         Section 8.2 Retention of Money. All moneys received by Trustee shall,
until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for
which they were received, but need not be segregated in any manner from any
other moneys (except to the extent required by law), and Trustee shall be under
no liability for interest on any moneys received by Trustee hereunder.

         Section 8.3 Successor Trustees. If Trustee or any successor Trustee
shall die, resign or become disqualified from acting in the execution of this
trust, or Beneficiary shall desire to appoint a substitute Trustee, Beneficiary
shall have full power to appoint one or more substitute Trustees and, if
preferred, several substitute Trustees in succession who shall succeed to all
the estates, rights, powers and duties of Trustee. Such appointment may be
executed by any authorized agent of Beneficiary and as so executed, such
appointment shall be conclusively presumed to be executed with authority, valid
and sufficient, without further proof of any action.

         Section 8.4 Perfection of Appointment. Should any deed, conveyance or
instrument of any nature be required from Grantor by any successor Trustee to
more fully and certainly vest in and confirm to such successor Trustee such
estates, rights, powers and duties, then, upon request by such Trustee, all such
deeds, conveyances and instruments shall be made, executed, acknowledged and
delivered and shall be caused to be recorded and/or filed by Grantor.

         Section 8.5 Trustee Liability. In no event or circumstance shall
Trustee or any substitute Trustee hereunder be personally liable under or as a
result of this Deed of Trust, either as a result of any action by Trustee (or
any substitute Trustee) in the exercise of the powers hereby granted or
otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.1 Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under
this Deed of Trust shall be given in accordance with Section 13.1 of the Credit
Agreement.

         Section 9.2 Covenants Running with the Land. All Obligations contained
in this Deed of Trust are intended by Grantor, Beneficiary and Trustee to be,
and shall be construed as, covenants running with the Land. As used herein,
"Grantor" shall refer to the party named in the first paragraph of this Deed of
Trust and to any subsequent owner of all or any portion of the Mortgaged
Property. All Persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Mortgaged

<PAGE>

Property shall be deemed to have notice of, and be bound by, the terms of the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that no such
party shall be entitled to any rights thereunder without the prior written
consent of Beneficiary.

         Section 9.3 Attorney-in-Fact. Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints
Beneficiary as its attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest
and with full power of substitution, with full authority in the place and stead
of Grantor and in the name of Grantor or otherwise (a) to execute and/or record
any notices of completion, cessation of labor or any other notices that
Beneficiary deems appropriate to protect Beneficiary's interest, if Grantor
shall fail to do so within ten (10) days after written request by Beneficiary,
(b) upon the issuance of a deed pursuant to the foreclosure of this Deed of
Trust or the delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, to execute all
instruments of assignment, conveyance or further assurance with respect to the
Leases, Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds,
Insurance and Condemnation Awards in favor of the grantee of any such deed and
as may be necessary or desirable for such purpose, (c) to prepare and file or
record financing statements and continuation statements, and to prepare, execute
and file or record applications for registration and like papers necessary to
create, perfect or preserve Beneficiary's security interests and rights in or to
any of the Mortgaged Property, and (d) after the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, to perform any obligation of Grantor
hereunder; provided, however, that (1) Beneficiary shall not under any
circumstances be obligated to perform any obligation of Grantor; (2) any sums
advanced by Beneficiary in such performance shall be added to and included in
the Indebtedness and shall bear interest at the highest rate at which interest
is then computed on any portion of the Indebtedness; (3) Beneficiary as such
attorney-in-fact shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually
received by Beneficiary; and (4) Beneficiary shall not be liable to Grantor or
any other person or entity for any failure to take any action which it is
empowered to take under this Section 9.3.

         Section 9.4 Successors and Assigns. This Deed of Trust shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of Beneficiary, the Lender Parties, Trustee and
Grantor and their respective successors and assigns. Grantor shall not, without
the prior written consent of Beneficiary, assign any rights, duties or
obligations hereunder.

         Section 9.5 No Waiver. Any failure by Beneficiary, the other Lender
Parties or Trustee to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of the Loan Documents shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of same, and Beneficiary, the other Lender Parties and Trustee shall have
the right at any time to insist upon strict performance of all of such terms,
provisions and conditions.

         Section 9.6 Credit Agreement. If any conflict or inconsistency exists
between this Deed of Trust and the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement
shall govern.

         Section 9.7 Release or Reconveyance. Upon payment in full of the
Indebtedness and performance in full of the Obligations or upon a sale or other
disposition of the Mortgaged Property permitted by the Credit Agreement,
Beneficiary, at Grantor's request and expense, shall release the liens and
security interests created by this Deed of Trust or reconvey the Mortgaged
Property to Grantor.

         Section 9.8 Waiver of Stay, Moratorium and Similar Rights. Grantor
agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully do so, that it will not at any
time insist upon or plead or in any way take advantage of any stay, marshalling
of assets, extension, redemption or moratorium law now or hereafter in force and
effect so as to prevent or hinder the enforcement of the provisions of this Deed

<PAGE>

of Trust or the Indebtedness or Obligations secured hereby, or any agreement
between Grantor and Beneficiary or any rights or remedies of Trustee,
Beneficiary or any other Lender Party.

         Section 9.9 Applicable Law. The provisions of this Deed of Trust
regarding the creation, perfection and enforcement of the liens and security
interests herein granted shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located. All other provisions of
this Deed of Trust shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(including, without limitation, Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law of
the State of New York).

         Section 9.10 Headings. The Article, Section and Subsection titles
hereof are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way alter,
modify or define, or be used in construing, the text of such Articles, Sections
or Subsections.

         Section 9.11 Severability. If any provision of this Deed of Trust shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be deemed severable from and
shall in no way affect the enforceability and validity of the remaining
provisions of this Deed of Trust.

         Section 9.12 Entire Agreement. This Deed of Trust and the other Loan
Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between Grantor and
Beneficiary relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings between such parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. Accordingly, the Loan Documents may not be
contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements
of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.

         Section 9.13 Beneficiary as Agent; Successor Agents.

         (a) Agent has been appointed to act as Agent hereunder by the other
Lender Parties. Agent shall have the right hereunder to make demands, to give
notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or
refrain from taking any action (including, without limitation, the release or
substitution of the Mortgaged Property) in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement, any related agency agreement among Agent and the other Lender
Parties (collectively, as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced from time to time, the "Agency Documents") and
this Deed of Trust. Grantor and all other Persons shall be entitled to rely on
releases, waivers, consents, approvals, notifications and other acts of Agent,
without inquiry into the existence of required consents or approvals of the
Lender Parties therefor.

         (b) Beneficiary shall at all times be the same Person that is Agent
under the Agency Documents. Written notice of resignation by Agent pursuant to
the Agency Documents shall also constitute notice of resignation as Agent under
this Deed of Trust. Removal of Agent pursuant to any provision of the Agency
Documents shall also constitute removal as Agent under this Deed of Trust.
Appointment of a successor Agent pursuant to the Agency Documents shall also
constitute appointment of a successor Agent under this Deed of Trust. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent by a successor Agent under the Agency
Documents, that successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested

<PAGE>

with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed
Agent as the Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust, and the retiring or removed
Agent shall promptly (i) assign and transfer to such successor Agent all of its
right, title and interest in and to this Deed of Trust and the Mortgaged
Property, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Agent such assignments
and amendments and take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate
in connection with the assignment to such successor Agent of the liens and
security interests created hereunder, whereupon such retiring or removed Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Deed of Trust.
After any retiring or removed Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Deed of Trust and the Agency Documents shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Deed of
Trust while it was Agent hereunder.
