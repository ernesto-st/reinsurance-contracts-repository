                                              --------------------
BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. and THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF CHICAGO, as syndication
agents for the Lenders hereunder (in such capacity, the "Syndication
                                                         -----------
Agents").

         WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders make loans and
other financial accommodations to the Borrower in the amount of up to
$205,000,000, as more particularly described herein;

         WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to make such loans and other
financial accommodations to the Borrower on the terms and conditions
contained herein;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:


                                  ARTICLE I

                                 DEFINITIONS

         SECTION 1.1  DEFINED TERMS.
                      -------------

         As used in this Agreement, terms defined in the preamble to this
Agreement have the meanings therein indicated, and the following terms have
the following meanings:

         "Account Designation Letter" shall mean the Notice of Account
          --------------------------
Designation Letter dated the Closing Date from the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as
Schedule 1.1(a).
---------------

         "Acquisition", by any Person, means the acquisition by such Person
          -----------
of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the Property of another
Person, whether or not involving a merger or consolidation with such Person.

         "Administrative Agent" shall have the meaning set forth in the
          --------------------
first paragraph of this Agreement and any successors in such capacity.


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         "Affiliate" shall mean as to any Person, any other Person
          ---------
(excluding any Subsidiary) which, directly or indirectly, is in control of,
is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes
of this definition, a Person shall be deemed to be "controlled by" a Person
if such Person possesses, directly or indirectly, power either (a) to vote
10% or more of the securities having ordinary voting power for the election
of directors of such Person or (b) to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of such Person whether by contract or otherwise.

         "Agreement" shall mean this Credit Agreement, as amended, modified
          ---------
or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms.

         "Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum
          -------------------
equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the
Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For
purposes hereof: "Prime Rate" shall mean, at any time, the rate of interest
                  ----------
per annum publicly announced from time to time by First Union at its
principal office in Charlotte, North Carolina as its prime rate. Each change
in the Prime Rate shall be effective as of the opening of business on the
day such change in the Prime Rate occurs. The parties hereto acknowledge
that the rate announced publicly by First Union as its Prime Rate is an
index or base rate and shall not necessarily be its lowest or best rate
charged to its customers or other banks; and "Federal Funds Effective Rate"
                                              ----------------------------
shall mean, for any day, the weighted average of the rates on overnight
federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System
arranged by federal funds brokers, as published on the next succeeding
Business Day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if such rate is
not so published on the next succeeding Business Day, the average of the
quotations for the day of such transactions received by the Administrative
Agent from three federal funds brokers of recognized standing selected by
it. If for any reason the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error) that it
is unable to ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate, for any reason,
including the inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain
sufficient quotations in accordance with the terms thereof, the Alternate
Base Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (b) of the first
sentence of this definition, as appropriate, until the circumstances giving
rise to such inability no longer exist. Any change in the Alternate Base
Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate
shall be effective on the opening of business on the date of such change.

         "Alternate Base Rate Loans" shall mean Loans that bear interest at
          -------------------------
an interest rate based on the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Applicable Margin" shall mean, for any day, the rate per annum set
          -----------------
forth below opposite the applicable Level then in effect, it being
understood that the Applicable Margin for (a) Alternate Base Rate Loans
shall be the percentage set forth under the column "Alternate Base Rate
Margin", (b) LIBOR Rate Loans shall be the percentage set forth under the
column "LIBOR Rate Margin", (c) the Letter of Credit Fee shall be the
percentage set forth under the column "LIBOR Rate Margin" and (d) the
Facility Fee shall be the percentage set forth under the column "Facility
Fee."

         notify the Borrower of all Competitive Bids made and the terms
         thereof. The Administrative Agent shall send a copy of each of the
         Competitive Bids to the Borrower for its records as soon as

         Agent. If the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Lender,
         -----
         elects to submit a Competitive Bid in response to any Competitive
         Bid Request, it shall submit such Competitive Bid directly to the
         Borrower one-half of an hour earlier than the latest time at which
         the other Lenders are required to submit their Competitive Bids to
         the Administrative Agent in response to such Competitive Bid
         Request pursuant to subsection (c) above.

                  (e) Acceptance of Competitive Bids. The Borrower may, in
                      ------------------------------
         its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the provisions of
         this subsection (e), accept or refuse any Competitive Bid offered
         to it. To accept a Competitive Bid, the Borrower shall give written
         notification (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing)
         substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.2(e) of its acceptance of
                                      --------------

         any or all such Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent by
         11:00 A.M.. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date on which
         notice of election to make a Competitive Bid is to be given to the
         Administrative Agent by the Lenders; provided, however, (i) the
                                              --------  -------
         failure by the Borrower to give timely notice of its acceptance of
         a Competitive Bid shall be deemed to be a refusal thereof, (ii) the
         Borrower may accept Competitive Bids only in ascending order of
         rates, (iii) the aggregate amount of Competitive Bids accepted by
         the Borrower shall not exceed the principal amount specified in the
         Competitive Bid Request, (iv) the Borrower may accept a portion of
         a Competitive Bid in the event, and to the extent, acceptance of
         the entire amount thereof would cause the Borrower to exceed the
         principal amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request, subject
         however to the minimum amounts provided herein (and provided that
         where two or more Lenders submit such a Competitive Bid at the same
         Competitive Bid Rate, then pro rata between or among such Lenders)
         and (v) no bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such
         Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof, except that where
         a portion of a Competitive Bid is accepted in accordance with the
         provisions of subsection (iv) hereof, then in a minimum principal
         amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess
         thereof (but not in any event less than the minimum amount
         specified in the Competitive Bid), and in calculating the pro rata
         allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple bids at a
         particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to subsection (iv) hereof,
         the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples of $100,000 in a
         manner which shall be in the discretion of the Borrower. A notice
         of acceptance of a Competitive Bid given by the Borrower in
         accordance with the provisions hereof shall be irrevocable. The
         Administrative Agent shall, not later than 12:00

         Administrative Agent of a notification from the Borrower of its
         acceptance and/or refusal of Competitive Bids, notify each affected
         Lender of its receipt and the contents thereof. Upon its receipt from
         the Administrative Agent of notification of the Borrower's acceptance
         of its Competitive Bid in accordance with the terms of this
         subsection (e), each successful bidding Lender will thereupon
         become bound, subject to the other applicable conditions hereof, to
         make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its bid has been
         accepted.

                  (f) Funding of Competitive Loans. Each Lender which is to
                      ----------------------------
         make a Competitive Loan shall make its Competitive Loan borrowing
         available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in
         Schedule 9.2, or at such other office as the Administrative Agent
         ------------
         may designate in writing, by 1:30 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
         time) on the date specified in the Competitive Bid Request in funds
         immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing
         will then be made available to the Borrower by crediting the
         account of the Borrower on the books of such office with the
         aggregate of the amount made available to the Administrative Agent
         by the applicable Competitive Loan Lenders and in like funds as
         received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (g) Maturity of Competitive Loans. Each Competitive Loan
                      -----------------------------
         shall mature and be due and payable in full on the last day of the
         Interest Period applicable thereto, unless accelerated sooner
         pursuant to Section 7.2. Unless the Borrower shall give notice to
         the Administrative Agent otherwise, the Borrower shall be deemed to
         have requested a Revolving Loan borrowing in the amount of the
         maturing Competitive Loan, the proceeds of which will be used to
         repay such Competitive Loan.

                  (h) Interest on Competitive Loans. Subject to the
                      -----------------------------
         provisions of Section 2.9, Competitive Loans shall bear interest in
         each case at the Competitive Bid Rate applicable thereto. Interest
         on Competitive Loans shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
         Payment Date.

                  (i) Competitive Loan Notes. The Competitive Loans made by
                      ----------------------
         each Lender shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note
         of the Borrower to such Lender in substantially the form of
         Schedule 2.2(i).

         among other things, the account party, the beneficiary, the face
         amount, expiry date as well as any payments or expirations which
         may have occurred. The Issuing Lender will further provide to the
         Administrative Agent promptly upon request copies of the Letters of
         Credit. The Issuing Lender will provide to the Administrative Agent
         promptly upon request a summary report of the nature and extent of
         LOC Obligations then outstanding.

                  (c) Participations. Each Lender upon issuance of a Letter
                      --------------
         of Credit shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a risk
         participation from the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and
         the obligations arising thereunder and any collateral relating
         thereto, in each case in an amount equal to its LOC Commitment
         Percentage of the obligations under such Letter of Credit and shall
         absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary
         obligor and not as surety, and be obligated to pay to the Issuing
         Lender therefor and discharge when due, its LOC Commitment
         Percentage of the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit.
         Without limiting the scope and nature of each Lender's
         participation in any Letter of Credit, to the extent that the
         Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as required hereunder or
         under any LOC Document, each such Lender shall pay to the Issuing
         Lender its LOC Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed drawing
         in same day funds on the day of notification by the Issuing Lender
         of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the provisions of subsection
         (d) hereof. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the
         Issuing Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
         affected by the occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any
         other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve
         or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the
         Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest
         as hereinafter provided.

                  (d) Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any
                      -------------
         Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall reimburse
         the Issuing Lender on the day of drawing under any Letter of Credit
         (either with the proceeds of a Swingline Loan or Revolving Loan
         obtained

                                     28

         hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds as provided herein or in
         the LOC Documents. If the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the
         Issuing Lender as provided herein, the unreimbursed amount of such
         drawing shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         Alternate Base Rate plus two percent (2%). Unless the Borrower
         shall immediately notify the Issuing Lender and the Administrative
         Agent of its intent to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender, the
         Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Swingline Loan, or if
         and to the extent Swingline Loans shall not be available, a
         Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing as provided in
         subsection (e) hereof, the proceeds of which will be used to
         satisfy the reimbursement obligations. The Borrower's reimbursement
         obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under all
         circumstances irrespective of any rights of set-off, counterclaim
         or defense to payment the Borrower may claim or have against the
         Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the
         beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person,
         including without limitation any defense based on any failure of
         the Borrower to receive consideration or the legality, validity,
         regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing
         Lender will promptly notify the other Lenders of the amount of any
         unreimbursed drawing and each Lender shall promptly pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in
         Dollars and in immediately available funds, the amount of such
         Lender's LOC Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed drawing.
         Such payment shall be made on the day such notice is received by
         such Lender from the Issuing Lender if such notice is received at
         or before 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), otherwise
         such payment shall be made at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte,
         North Carolina time) on the Business Day next succeeding the day
         such notice is received. If such Lender does not pay such amount to
         the Issuing Lender in full upon such request, such Lender shall, on
         demand, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period from
         the date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the
         Issuing Lender in full at a rate per annum equal to, if paid within
         two (2) Business Days of the date of drawing, the Federal Funds
         Effective Rate and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base
         Rate. Each Lender's obligation to make such payment to the Issuing
         Lender, and the right of the Issuing Lender to receive the same,
         shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be affected by any
         circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the termination of
         this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the existence of a
         Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the Borrower
         Obligations hereunder and shall be made without any offset,
         abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which
                      ------------------------------
         the Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have
         requested, (i) a Swingline Loan borrowing to reimburse a drawing
         under a Letter of Credit, the Swingline Lender shall make the
         Swingline Loan advance pursuant to the terms of the request or
         deemed request in accordance with the provisions for Swingline Loan
         advances hereunder, or (ii) a Revolving Loan to reimburse a drawing
         under a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall give
         notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been requested or
         deemed requested in connection with a drawing under a Letter of
         Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan borrowing comprised entirely
         of Alternate Base Rate Loans (each such

         pursuant to Section 7.2) pro rata based on each Lender's respective

         Revolving Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to
         any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2) and in
         the case of both clauses (i) and (ii) the proceeds thereof shall be
         paid directly to the Issuing Lender for application to the
         respective LOC Obligations. Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees
         to make such Revolving Loans immediately upon any such request or
         deemed request on account of each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount
         and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the
         same such date notwithstanding (i) the amount of Mandatory
                        ---------------
         Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for borrowings of
         Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any
         conditions specified in Section 4.2 are then satisfied, (iii)
         whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure
         for any such request or deemed request for Revolving Loan to be
         made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.1(b), (v) the date
         of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (vi) any reduction in the Revolving
         Committed Amount after any such Letter of Credit may have been
         drawn upon. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for
         any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including,
         without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding
         under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each
         such Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith fund (as of the
         date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but
         adjusted for any payments received from the Borrower on or after
         such date and prior to such purchase) its Participation Interests
         in the outstanding LOC Obligations; provided, further, that in the
                                             --------  -------
         event any Lender shall fail to fund its Participation Interest on
         the day the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, then
         the amount of such Lender's unfunded Participation Interest therein
         shall bear interest payable to the Issuing Lender upon demand, at
         the rate equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of such
         date, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter at a rate
         equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (f) Modification, Extension. The issuance of any
                      -----------------------
         supplement, modification, amendment, renewal, or extension to any
         Letter of Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all
         respects the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit
         hereunder.

                  (g) Uniform Customs and Practices. The Issuing Lender
                      -----------------------------
         shall have the Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs
         and Practice for Documentary Credits, as published as of the date
         of issue by the International Chamber of Commerce (the "UCP"), in
                                                                 ---
         which case the UCP may be incorporated therein and deemed in all
         respects to be a part thereof.

         Commitment, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
         for the ratable benefit of the Lenders a facility fee (the
         "Facility Fee") in an amount equal to the Applicable Margin per

                  Commitment" under the 364-Day Credit Agreement, (as such
                  term is defined therein) exceeds the product of (A)

                  Lender, a per annum fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the
                  Utilized Revolving Commitment (the "Utilization Fees").
                                                      ----------------

                           (ii) The accrued Utilization Fees shall be due
                  and payable in arrears fifteen days after the end of each
                  fiscal quarter of the Borrower (as well as on the

         Commitments, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender a fee
         (the "Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the Applicable Margin per

         annum on the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn
         under each Letter of Credit from the date of issuance to the date
         of expiration. In addition to such Letter of Credit Fee, the

         sharing by the other Lenders, an additional facing fee of
         one-eighth of one percent (1/8%) per annum on the average daily

         any such reduction which shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000
         or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall be
         irrevocable and effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent,
         provided that no such reduction or termination shall be permitted
         --------
         if after giving effect thereto, and to any prepayments of the

         from time to time to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to LIBOR
         Rate Loans, by giving the Administrative Agent at least three
         Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice of such election. A
         form of Notice of Conversion/Extension is attached as Schedule 2.10.
                                                               -------------
         If the date upon which an Alternate Base Rate Loan is to be
         converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan is not a Business Day, then such
         conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
         during the period from such last day of an Interest Period to such
         succeeding Business Day such Loan shall bear interest as if it were
         an Alternate Base Rate Loan. All or any part of outstanding
         Alternate Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein,

         expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance
         by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in Section
         2.10(a); provided, that no LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such
                  --------
         when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, in which case such Loan shall be automatically
         converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the
         applicable Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower
         shall fail to give timely notice of an election to continue a LIBOR
         Rate Loan, or the continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans is not permitted
         hereunder, such LIBOR Rate Loans shall be automatically converted
         to Alternate Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest
         Period with respect thereto.

         SECTION 2.11 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.
                      --------------------------------

                  (a) Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate
         Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365
         days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days elapsed. All
         other fees, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder shall
         be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days
         elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable
         notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a
         LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof. Any
         change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in
         the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of
         business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate
         shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective
         date and the amount of each such change.

                  (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement
         shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in
         the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at
         the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement
         showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent in
         determining any interest rate.

         SECTION 2.12 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS.
                      -------------------------------

         Each borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction of the
Revolving Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective
                                    --- ----
Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment under this Agreement or
any Note shall be applied, first, to any fees then due and owing by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.5, second, to interest then due and owing in
respect of the Notes of the Borrower and, third, to principal then due and
owing hereunder and under the Notes of the Borrower. Each payment on account
of any fees pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be made pro rata in accordance
                                                  --- ----
with the respective amounts due and owing (except as to the portion of the
Letter of Credit retained by the Issuing Lender and the Issuing Lender
Fees). Each optional prepayment on account of principal of the Loans shall
be applied, to such of the Loans as the Borrower may designate (to be
applied pro rata among the Lenders); provided, that prepayments made
        --- ----                     --------
pursuant to Section 2.15 shall be applied in accordance with such section.
Each mandatory prepayment on account of principal of the Loans shall be
applied in accordance with Section 2.7(b). With respect to Competitive
Loans, if the Borrower fails to specify the particular Competitive Loan or
Loans as to which any payment or other amount should be applied and it is
not otherwise clear as to the particular Competitive Loan or Loans to which
such payment or other amounts relate, or any such payment or other amount is
to be applied to Competitive Loans without regard to any such direction by
the Borrower, then each payment or prepayment of principal on Competitive
Loans and each payment of interest or other amount on or in respect of
Competitive Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the relevant
Competitive Loan Lenders in accordance with the then outstanding amounts of
their respective Competitive Loans. All payments (including prepayments) to
be made by the Borrower on account of principal, interest and fees shall be
made without defense, set-off or counterclaim (except as provided in Section
2.18(b)) and shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders at the

                                     34

Administrative Agent's office specified on Schedule 9.2 in Dollars and in
                                           ------------
immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North
Carolina time) on the date when due. The Administrative Agent shall
distribute such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto promptly upon
receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than
payments on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other
than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon
shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any
payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such
payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be
made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

         SECTION 2.13 NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.
                      ------------------------------------------------

                  (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified in writing by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be
         made by such Lender (which notice shall be effective upon receipt)
         that such Lender does not intend to make the proceeds of such Loan
         available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
         assume that such Lender has made such proceeds available to the
         Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may
         in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to)
         make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
         corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the
         Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to
         recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender
         does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the
         Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent
         will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
         immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative
         Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover
         from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on
         such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
         corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent
         to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered
         by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from
         the Borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing
         pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the
         Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified in writing by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any
         payment is due from it hereunder (which notice shall be effective
         upon receipt) that the Borrower does not intend to make such
         payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has
         made such payment when due, and the Administrative Agent may in
         reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make
         available to each Lender on such payment date an amount equal to
         the portion of such assumed payment to which such Lender is
         entitled hereunder, and if the Borrower has not in fact made such
         payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand,
         repay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to such
         Lender. If such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent on a
         date after the date such amount was made available to such Lender,
         such Lender shall pay to the

                                     35

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         Administrative Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect
         of each day from the date such amount was made available by the
         Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to
         the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (c) A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to
         the Borrower or any Lender with respect to any amount owing under
         this Section 2.13 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
         error.

         SECTION 2.14 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE.
                      ------------------------------------

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (a) the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means
do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period, or (b) the
Required Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate
Loans that the Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR Rate Loan
during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
telephone notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to the
Borrower, and the Lenders at least two Business Days prior to the first day
of such Interest Period. Unless the Borrower shall have notified the
Administrative Agent upon receipt of such telephone notice that it wishes to
rescind or modify its request regarding such LIBOR Rate Loans, any Loans
that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made as
Alternate Base Rate Loans and any Loans that were requested to be converted
into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted into Alternate Base
Rate Loans. Until any such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative
Agent, no further Loans shall be made as, continued as, or converted into,
LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so affected.

         SECTION 2.15 ILLEGALITY.
                      ----------

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation
or application thereof by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender
shall make it unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make
or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain
in the interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the
funds with which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of
such Lender hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans
as such shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
give notice that the condition or situation which gave rise to the
suspension shall no longer exist, and (c) such Lender's Loans then
outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall be converted on the last day
of the Interest Period for such Loans or within such earlier period as
required by law as Alternate Base Rate Loans. The Borrower hereby agrees
promptly to pay any Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct costs (but not
including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender in

                                     36

<PAGE>

making any repayment in accordance with this Section including, but not
limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder.
A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to
use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR
Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be
payable pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that such efforts shall
                                  --------  -------
not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or
regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be
material.

         SECTION 2.16 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.
                      -------------------

                  (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of
         Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance
         by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having
         the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
         Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

                           (i) shall subject such Lender to any tax of any
                  kind whatsoever with respect to any Letter of Credit or
                  any application relating thereto, any LIBOR Rate Loan made
                  by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such
                  Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate
                  of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);

                           (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
                  requirement against assets held by, deposits or other
                  liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or
                  other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of
                  funds by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise
                  included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder;
                  or

                           (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other
                  condition;

         and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
         such Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or the
         Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or
         under any Note, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly
         pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary
         to compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduced
         amount receivable which such Lender reasonably deems to be material
         as determined by such Lender with respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans
         or Letters of Credit. A certificate as to any additional amounts
         payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through
         the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in
         the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use reasonable
         efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic
         Lending Office or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to
         avoid or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable
         pursuant to this paragraph of this Section; provided, however, that
                                                     --------  -------
         such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any
         additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such
         Lender to be material.

                  (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that
         the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding
         capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or
         compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such
         Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
         (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
         Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or
         shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
         Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its
         obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or
         such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change
         or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such
         corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
         amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then from
         time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender,
         the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount as
         shall be certified by such Lender as being required to compensate
         it for such reduction. Such a certificate as to any additional
         amounts payable under this Section submitted by a Lender (which
         certificate shall include a description of the basis for the
         computation), through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
         shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (c) The agreements in this Section 2.16 shall survive the
         termination of this Agreement and payment of the Notes and all
         other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 2.17 INDEMNITY.
                      ---------

         The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold
such Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment
of the principal amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in
accordance with the terms hereof, (b) default by the Borrower in accepting a
borrowing after the Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms
hereof, (c) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment after the
Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d)
the making by the Borrower of a prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion
thereof, on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with
respect thereto, in each case including, but not limited to, any such loss
or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders
of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Loans hereunder. A
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
(which certificate must be delivered to the Administrative Agent within
thirty days following such default, prepayment or conversion) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section
shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 2.18 TAXES.
                      -----

                  (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under
         any Note will be, except as provided in Section 2.18(b), made free
         and clear of, and without deduction or

                                     38

         withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
         duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now
         or hereafter imposed by any Governmental Authority or by any
         political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with
         respect to such payments (but excluding any tax imposed on or
         measured by the net income or profits of a Lender pursuant to the
         laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the
         jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending
         office of such Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or
         therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with
         respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
         duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to
         collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed,
                          -----
         the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such
         additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all
         amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after
         withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not
         be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. The
         Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent, upon written
         request of the Administrative Agent, as soon as practicable after
         the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law
         certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and required
         by law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower.
         The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and
         reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of
         any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

                  (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as
         such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to
         deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to
         the Closing Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or
         transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section
         9.6(d) (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder
         immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of
         such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) if the Lender is a
         "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, two
         accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
         Service Form 4224 or 1001 (or successor forms) certifying such
         Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States
         withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this
         Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank"
         within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either
         Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 as set forth in clause
         (i) above, or (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
         Schedule 2.18 (any such certificate, a "2.18 Certificate") and (y)
         -------------                           ----------------
         two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal
         Revenue Service Form W-8 (or successor form) certifying such
         Lender's entitlement to an exemption from United States withholding
         tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this
         Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that
         it will deliver upon the Borrower's request updated versions of the
         foregoing, as applicable, whenever the previous certification has
         become obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, together
         with such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or
         establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption
         from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to
         payments under this Agreement and any Note. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.18(a), but subject
         to the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be

         entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct
         or withhold Taxes imposed by the United States (or any political
         subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest,
         fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any
         Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is defined
         in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax
         purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the
         Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a
         complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the
         Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 2.18(a) hereof
         to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of Taxes
         imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to
         the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be
         provided to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18(b) or (II)
         in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender
         described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do
         not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such Taxes.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding
         sentence or elsewhere in this Section 2.18, the Borrower agrees to
         pay additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner
         set forth in Section 2.18(a) (without regard to the identity of the
         jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of
         any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the
         immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes after the
         Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule,
         regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof,
         relating to the deducting or withholding of Taxes.

                  (c) Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts
         (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office
         or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to
         minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to
         this Section; provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause
                       --------  -------
         the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or
         regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to
         be material.

                  (d) If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant to
         this Section 2.18 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use
         reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its
         tax liabilities on account of such payment; provided that such
                                                     --------
         Lender shall have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if
         either (i) it is in an excess foreign tax credit position or (ii)
         it believes in good faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a
         refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it. In the
         event that such Lender receives such a refund or credit, such
         Lender shall pay to the Borrower an amount that such Lender
         reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by
         such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower. In the
         event that no refund or credit is obtained with respect to the
         Borrower's payments to such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18,
         then such Lender shall upon request provide a certification that
         such Lender has not received a refund or credit for such payments.
         Nothing contained in this Section 2.18 shall require a Lender to
         disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of
         any tax benefit or any other amount or the basis of its
         determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of
         this Section 2.18 to the Borrower or any other party.

                  (e) The agreements in this Section 2.18 shall survive the
         termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all
         other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 2.19 INDEMNIFICATION; NATURE OF ISSUING LENDER'S DUTIES.
                      --------------------------------------------------

                  (a) In addition to its other obligations under Section
         2.4, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
         the Issuing Lender harmless from and against any and all claims,
         demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses
         (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that the Issuing Lender may
         incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i)
         the issuance of any Letter of Credit or (ii) the failure of the
         Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a
         result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
         present or future de jure or de facto government or governmental
         authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called "Government
                                                               ----------
         Acts").
         ----

                  (b) As between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender, the
         Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of
         any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof. The Issuing Lender
         shall not be responsible: (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency,
         accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by
         any party in connection with the application for and issuance of
         any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any
         or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or
         forged; (ii) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
         transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any
         Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
         thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or
         ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of
         a Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in
         order to draw upon a Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions,
         interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
         messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or
         not they be in cipher; (v) for errors in interpretation of
         technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or
         otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under
         a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (vii) for any
         consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing
         Lender, including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of
         the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the
         Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of
         the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or
         omitted by the Issuing Lender, under or in connection with any
         Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted
         in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender under any
         resulting liability to the Borrower. It is the intention of the
         parties that this Agreement shall be construed and applied to
         protect and indemnify the Issuing Lender against any and all risks
         involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which
         risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower, including, without
         limitation, any and all risks of the acts or omissions, whether
         rightful or wrongful, of any Government Authority. The Issuing
         Lender shall not, in any way, be liable for any failure by the
         Issuing Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any

                                     41

<PAGE>

         Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other
         cause beyond the control of the Issuing Lender.

                  (d) Nothing in this Section 2.19 is intended to limit the
         reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained in Section
         2.4(d) hereof. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section
         2.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. No act or
         omissions of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit
         shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Issuing Lender
         to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Agreement.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         this Section 2.19, the Borrower shall have no obligation to
         indemnify any Issuing Lender in respect of any liability incurred
         by such Issuing Lender arising out of the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender (including action not
         taken by an Issuing Lender), as determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction.


                                 ARTICLE III

                       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the
Extensions of Credit herein provided for, the Borrower hereby represents and
warrants to the Administrative Agent and to each Lender that:

         SECTION 3.1  FINANCIAL CONDITION.
                      -------------------

         Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of such
dates. All such financial statements, including the related schedules and
notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
consistently throughout the periods involved (except as disclosed therein).

         SECTION 3.2  NO CHANGE.
                      ---------

         Since December 31, 1998 (and after delivery of annual audited
financial statements in accordance with Section 5.1(a), from the date of the
most recently delivered annual audited financial statements) there has been
no development or event which has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.3  CORPORATE EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.
                      ----------------------------------------

         Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, (b) has the requisite power

                                     42

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

and authority and the legal right to own and operate all its material
property, to lease the material property it operates as lessee and to
conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified
to conduct business and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification except to the extent that the failure
to so qualify or be in good standing could not, in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with
all Requirements of Law (including without limitation, environmental laws),
except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.4  CORPORATE POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS.
                      -------------------------------------------------------

         The Borrower has the full power and authority and the legal right
to make, deliver and perform the Credit Documents to which it is party and
has taken all necessary limited liability company or corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the Credit
Documents to which it is party. No consent or authorization of, filing with,
notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or
any other Person is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or
with the execution, delivery or performance of any Credit Document by the
Borrower (other than those which have been obtained) or with the validity or
enforceability of any Credit Document against the Borrower. Each Credit
Document to which it is a party has been duly executed and delivered on
behalf of the Borrower. Each Credit Document to which it is a party
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower,
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

         SECTION 3.5  NO LEGAL BAR; NO DEFAULT.
                      ------------------------

         The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents,
the borrowings thereunder and the use of the proceeds of the Loans will not
violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower
or its Subsidiaries (except those as to which waivers or consents have been
obtained), and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant
to any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation other than any Liens
arising under or contemplated in connection with the Credit Documents.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or with
respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         SECTION 3.6  NO MATERIAL LITIGATION.
                      ----------------------

         Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6, no litigation, investigation
                                ------------
or proceeding (including without limitation, any environmental proceeding)
of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or against the

                                     43

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or their
respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to the Credit Documents
or any Loan or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) which, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.7  INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.
                      ----------------------

         The Borrower is not an "investment company", or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         SECTION 3.8  MARGIN REGULATIONS.
                      ------------------

         No part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder will be used directly
or indirectly for any purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent
with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.
The Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a group do not own "margin stock"
except as identified in the financial statements referred to in Section 3.1
and the aggregate value of all "margin stock" owned by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a group does not exceed 25% of the value of their
assets.

         SECTION 3.9  ERISA.
                      -----

         Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9, neither a Reportable Event nor
                                ------------
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period
prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with
respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, except to the extent
that any such occurrence or failure to comply would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No termination of a Single
Employer Plan has occurred resulting in any liability that has remained
underfunded, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during
such five-year period which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single
Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not,
as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of
such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount which, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled
Entity is currently subject to any liability for a complete or partial
withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.10 PURPOSE OF LOANS.
                      ----------------

         The proceeds of the Loans hereunder shall be used solely by the
Borrower to (a) refinance existing Indebtedness of the Borrower and to pay
certain fees and expenses related thereto, and (b)

                                     44

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including
commercial paper back-up. The Letters of Credit shall be used only for or in
connection with appeal bonds, reimbursement obligations arising in
connection with surety and reclamation bonds, reinsurance, domestic or
international trade transactions and obligations not otherwise
aforementioned relating to transactions entered into by the applicable
account party in the ordinary course of business.

         SECTION 3.11 SUBSIDIARIES.
                      ------------

         Set forth on Schedule 3.11 is a complete and accurate list of all
                      -------------
Subsidiaries of the Borrower. Information on the attached Schedule includes
state of incorporation and the percentage of outstanding shares of each
class of stock owned by the Borrower.

         SECTION 3.12 OWNERSHIP.
                      ---------

         Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is the owner of, and has
good and marketable title to, all of its respective assets, except as may be
permitted pursuant Section 6.13 hereof, and none of such assets is subject
to any Lien other than Permitted Liens.

         SECTION 3.13 INDEBTEDNESS.
                      ------------

         Except as otherwise permitted under Section 6.1, the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries have no Indebtedness.

         SECTION 3.14 TAXES.
                      -----

         Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed, or caused to
be filed, all tax returns (federal, state, local and foreign) required to be
filed and paid (a) all amounts of taxes shown thereon to be due (including
interest and penalties) and (b) all other taxes, fees, assessments and other
governmental charges (including mortgage recording taxes, documentary stamp
taxes and intangibles taxes) owing by it, except for such taxes (i) which
are not yet delinquent or (ii) that are being contested in good faith and by
proper proceedings, and against which adequate reserves are being maintained
in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
aware as of the Closing Date of any proposed tax assessments against it or
any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.15 INVESTMENTS.
                      -----------

         All Investments of each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
Permitted Investments.

         SECTION 3.16 NO BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS.
                      --------------------------

         None of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement or instrument or subject to any other obligation or any charter or
corporate restriction or any provision of any applicable law, rule or
regulation which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.17 BROKERS' FEES.
                      -------------

         None of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
to any Person in respect of any finder's, broker's, investment banking or
other similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
under the Credit Documents other than the closing and other fees payable
pursuant to this Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 3.18 LABOR MATTERS.
                      -------------

         There are no collective bargaining agreements or Multiemployer
Plans covering the employees of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing Date, other than as set forth in Schedule 3.18 hereto.
                                                -------------
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (a) has suffered any
strikes, walkouts, work stoppages or other material labor difficulty within
the last five years, other than as set forth in Schedule 3.18 hereto or (b)
                                                -------------
has knowledge of any potential or pending strike, walkout or work stoppage

         SECTION 3.19 ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION.
                      ----------------------------------------

         All factual information heretofore, contemporaneously or hereafter
furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender for purposes of or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby, is or will be true and accurate in all material respects
and not incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make
such information not misleading. There is no fact now known to the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries which has, or could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect which fact has not been set forth herein, in
the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries furnished to
the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, or in any certificate, opinion
or other written statement made or furnished by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders.

         SECTION 3.20 YEAR 2000 ISSUE.
                      ---------------

         Any reprogramming and related testing required to permit the proper
functioning of the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' computer systems in and
following the year 2000 will be completed in all material respects prior to
September 1, 1999 (that is, the Borrower will be "Year 2000 Compliant"), and
the cost to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of such reprogramming and
testing will not result in a Default or Event of Default or a Material
Adverse Effect. Except for such reprogramming referred to in the preceding
sentence as may be necessary, the computer and management information
systems of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are and, with ordinary course
upgrading and maintenance, will continue for the term of this Agreement to
be, adequate for the conduct of its business.

request of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice
to the Borrower declare the Commitments to be terminated forthwith,
whereupon the Commitments shall immediately terminate; and (ii) with the
written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or
upon the written request of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
shall, by notice of default to the Borrower, declare the Loans (with accrued
interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the
Notes to be due and payable forthwith and direct the Borrower to pay to the
Administrative Agent cash collateral as security for the LOC Obligations for
subsequent drawings under then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount
equal to the maximum amount which may be drawn under Letters of Credit then
outstanding, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable.


                                ARTICLE VIII

                                  THE AGENT

         SECTION 8.1  APPOINTMENT.
                      -----------

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints First Union
National Bank as the Administrative Agent of such Lender under this
Agreement, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes First Union National
Bank, as the Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such action on
its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly
set forth herein, or any

                                     61

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 8.2  DELEGATION OF DUTIES.
                      --------------------

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable
care. Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may appoint
one of its affiliates as its agent to perform the functions of the
Administrative Agent hereunder relating to the advancing of funds to the
Borrower and distribution of funds to the Lenders and to perform such other
related functions of the Administrative Agent hereunder as are reasonably
incidental to such functions.

         SECTION 8.3  EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.
                      ----------------------

         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (a)
liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
Person under or in connection with this Agreement (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in
any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by the Borrower or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement or
other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency
of any of the Credit Documents or for any failure of the Borrower to perform
its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not
be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance by the Borrower of any of the agreements contained
in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of the Borrower.

         SECTION 8.4  RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.
                      --------------------------------

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation,
counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected
by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless (a) a written
notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed
with the Administrative Agent and (b) the Administrative Agent shall have
received the written agreement of such assignee to be bound hereby as fully
and to the same extent as if such assignee were an original Lender party
hereto, in each case in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in

                                     62

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under any of the Credit Documents in accordance with
a request of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as may be required
under this Agreement, and such request and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future
holders of the Notes.

         SECTION 8.5  NOTICE OF DEFAULT.
                      -----------------

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless
the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall
take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that
                                                --------  -------
unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such
directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests
of the Lenders except to the extent that this Credit Agreement expressly
requires that such action be taken, or not taken, only with the consent or
upon the authorization of the Required Lenders, or all of the Lenders, as
the case may be.

         SECTION 8.6  NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.
                      ------------------------------------------------------

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to
it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including
any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each
Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower
and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the

                                     63

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise),
prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the
possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         SECTION 8.7  INDEMNIFICATION.
                      ---------------

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its
capacity hereunder (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at
any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment
of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit
Document or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or
omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment
           --------  -------
of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The agreements in this
Section 8.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of
the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 8.8  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.
                      -----------------------------------------------

         The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to,
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Borrower as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative
Agent hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any
Note issued to it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

         SECTION 8.9  SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.
                      ------------------------------

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. If the Administrative
Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the
Notes, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by
the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights,
powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative
Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and
approval, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the
part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring Agent's
resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this

                                     64

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Section 8.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

         SECTION 8.10 SYNDICATION AGENTS.
                      ------------------

         Neither of the Syndication Agents shall have any right, power, duty
or obligation under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have
a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the
Agent in Section 8.6.

                                 ARTICLE IX

                                MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 9.1  AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.
                      ----------------------

         Neither this Agreement, nor any of the Notes, nor any of the other
Credit Documents, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented, waived or modified except in accordance with the provisions of
this Section nor may be released except as specifically provided herein or
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1. The Required Lenders
may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the
Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the
other Credit Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this
Agreement or the other Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights
of the Lenders or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on
such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders may specify in such
instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided,
                                                                   --------
however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, waiver, supplement,
-------
modification or release shall:

                           (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled
                  date of maturity of any Loan, LOC Obligation or Note or
                  any installment thereon (including any mandatory
                  prepayment), or reduce the stated rate of any interest or
                  fee payable hereunder (other than interest at the
                  increased post-default rate) or extend the scheduled date
                  of any payment thereof or increase the amount or extend
                  the expiration date of any Lender's Commitment or any LOC
                  Obligation beyond the Revolving Commitment Termination
                  Date, in each case without the written consent of each
                  Lender directly affected thereby, or

                           (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this
                  Section 9.1 or reduce the percentage specified in the
                  definition of Required Lenders, without the written
                  consent of all the Lenders, or

                                     65

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

                           (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of
                  Article VIII without the written consent of the then
                  Administrative Agent, or

                           (iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of the
                  Credit Documents requiring consent, approval or request of
                  the Required Lenders or all Lenders, without the written
                  consent of all of the Lenders and, provided, further, that
                                                     --------  -------
                  no amendment, waiver or consent affecting the rights or
                  duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender
                  under any Credit Document shall in any event be effective,
                  unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent
                  and/or the Issuing Lender, as applicable, in addition to
                  the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action.

         Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and
any such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be
binding upon the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all
future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former
position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding Loans and Notes and
other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be
deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right
consequent thereon.

         Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent
of the Borrower shall not be required for any amendment, modification or
waiver of the provisions of Article VIII (other than the provisions of
Section 8.9); provided, however, that the Administrative Agent will provide
              --------  -------
written notice to the Borrower of any such amendment, modification or
waiver. In addition, the Borrower and the Lenders hereby authorize the
Administrative Agent to modify this Credit Agreement by unilaterally
amending or supplementing Schedule 2.1(a) from time to time in the manner
                          ---------------
requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order
to reflect any assignments or transfers of the Loans as provided for
hereunder; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall promptly
           --------  -------
deliver a copy of any such modification to the Borrower and each Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization
plan that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the
provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the
unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders
may consent to allow the Borrower to use cash collateral in the context of a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

         SECTION 9.2  NOTICES.
                      -------

         Except as otherwise provided in Article II, all notices, requests

         this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain
         solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall
         remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes under this
         Agreement, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall
         continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
         with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. No
         Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the
         Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver
         of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent
         such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of
         any Loan or Note or any installment thereon in which such
         Participant is participating, or reduce the stated rate or extend
         the time of payment of interest or fees thereon (except in
         connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default
         rate) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the
         amount of the Participant's participation over the amount thereof
         then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
         Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
         participation, and that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall
         be permitted without consent of any participant if the
         Participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof)
         or (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of
         any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. In the case
         of any such participation, the Participant shall not have any
         rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents
         (the Participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such
         participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by
         such Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto) and all
         amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if
         such Lender had not sold such participation, provided that each
                                                      --------
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16,
         2.17, 2.18 and 9.5 with respect to its participation in the
         Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time; provided,
                                                                  --------
         that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount
         pursuant to such Sections than the transferor Lender would have
         been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the
         participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such
         Participant had no such transfer occurred.

                  (c) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
         commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law,
         at any time, sell or assign to any Lender or any affiliate thereof
         and with the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no
         Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (in
         each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), to
         one or more additional banks or financial institutions ("Purchasing
                                                                  ----------

         respect to its Revolving Commitment and its Revolving Loans (or, if
         less, the entire amount of such Lender's obligations), pursuant to
         a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing
         Lender and such transferor Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing
         Lender that is not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, the
         Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing, the Borrower), and delivered to the

         that any sale or assignment to an existing Lender or any Affiliate
         of an existing Lender shall not require the consent of the
         Administrative Agent or the Borrower nor shall any such sale or
         assignment be subject to the minimum assignment amounts specified
         herein. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording,
         from and after the Transfer Effective Date specified in such
         Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Lender
         thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in
         such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and
         obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment as set forth
         therein, and (y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the
         extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released
         from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of a
         Commitment Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining
         portion of a transferor Lender's rights and obligations under this
         Agreement, such transferor Lender shall cease to be a party
         hereto). Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to
         amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent,
         necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the
         resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the
         purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the
         rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this
         Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date
         specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the Borrower, at
         its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
         Agent in exchange for the Notes delivered to the Administrative
         Agent pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement new Notes to
         the order of such Purchasing Lender in an amount equal to the
         Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
         Supplement and, unless the transferor Lender has not retained a
         Commitment hereunder, new Notes to the order of the transferor
         Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it
         hereunder. Such new Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall
         otherwise be in the form of the Notes replaced thereby. The Notes
         surrendered by the transferor Lender shall be returned by the
         Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled".

                  (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
         referred to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer
         Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
                                                         --------
         recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
         Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each
         Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be
         conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
         name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded
         therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
         available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
         reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e) Upon its receipt of a duly executed Commitment
         Transfer Supplement, together with payment to the Administrative
         Agent by the transferor Lender or the Purchasing Lender, as agreed
         between them, of a registration and processing fee of $3,000 for
         each Purchasing Lender listed in such Commitment Transfer
         Supplement and the Notes subject to such Commitment Transfer
         Supplement, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such
         Commitment Transfer Supplement, (ii) record the information

                                     70

         contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice of
         such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

                  (f) The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
         Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any
                                                    ----------
         prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's
         possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates which has
         been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower
         pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such
         Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with such
         Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior
         to becoming a party to this Agreement, in each case subject to
         Section 9.16.

                  (g) At the time of each assignment pursuant to this
         Section 9.6 to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and
         which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in
         Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes,
         the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Borrower and
         the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
         Forms (and, if applicable, a 2.18 Certificate) described in Section
         2.18.

                  (h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging
         or assigning any of its rights under this Agreement (including,
         without limitation, any right to payment of principal and interest
         under any Note) to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
         applicable laws.

         SECTION 9.7  ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.
                      --------------------

                  (a) Each Lender agrees that if any Lender (a "benefited
                                                                ---------
         Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of
         ------
         its Loans, or interest thereon, in respect thereof (whether
         voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
         proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7.1(f), or
         otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to any
         other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans, or
         interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash
         from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of
         each such other Lender's Loan, as shall be necessary to cause such
         benefited Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
         the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
                      --------  -------
         excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
         benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the
         purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
         recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each
         Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may
         exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation,
         rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such
         Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

                  (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
         provided by law (including, without limitation, other rights of
         set-off), each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to
         the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the
         Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon the
         occurrence of any Event of

         Default, to setoff and appropriate and apply any and all deposits
         (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any
         currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any
         currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or
         contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such
         Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the
         account of the Borrower, or any part thereof in such amounts as
         such Lender may elect, against and on account of the obligations
         and liabilities of the Borrower to such Lender hereunder and claims
         of every nature and description of such Lender against the
         Borrower, in any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the
         Notes or under any documents contemplated by or referred to herein
         or therein, as such Lender may elect, whether or not such Lender
         has made any demand for payment and although such obligations,
         liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. The
         aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against
         the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in
         possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver or
         execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or
         against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or any
         such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
         benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or
         attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of
         set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the
         occurrence of any Event of Default. Each Lender agrees promptly to
         notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such
         set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however,
                                                      --------  -------
         that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity
         of such set-off and application.

         SECTION 9.15 ARBITRATION.
                      -----------

                  (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.14 to the
         contrary, upon demand of any party hereto, whether made before or
         within three (3) months after institution of any judicial
         proceeding, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of,
         connected with or relating to this Agreement and other Credit
         Documents ("Disputes") between or among parties to this Agreement
         shall be subject to non-binding arbitration as provided herein.
         Institution of a judicial proceeding by a party does not waive the
         right of that party to demand arbitration hereunder. Disputes may
         include, without limitation, tort claims, counterclaims, disputes
         as to whether a matter is subject to arbitration, claims brought as
         class actions, claims arising from Credit Documents executed in the
         future, or claims arising out of or connected with the transaction
         reflected by this Agreement.

                  Arbitration shall be conducted under and governed by the
         Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Arbitration Rules") of the
         American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") and Title 9 of the
         U.S. Code. All arbitration hearings shall be conducted in New York,
         New York. A hearing shall begin within 90 days of demand for
         arbitration and all hearings shall be concluded within 120 days of
         demand for arbitration. These time limitations may not be extended
         unless a party shows cause for extension and then no more than a
         total extension of 60 days. The expedited procedures set forth in
         Rule 51 et seq. of the Arbitration Rules shall be applicable to
         claims of less than $1,000,000. All applicable statutes of
         limitation shall apply to any Dispute. Arbitrators shall be
         licensed attorneys selected from the Commercial Financial Dispute
         Arbitration Panel of the AAA. The parties hereto do not waive
         applicable Federal or state substantive law except as provided
         herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration provision
         does not apply to disputes under or related to Hedging Agreements.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the preceding arbitration provisions,
         the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower agree to
         preserve, without diminution, certain remedies that the
         Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may employ or
         exercise freely, independently or in connection with an arbitration
         proceeding or after an arbitration action is brought. The
         Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders shall have the right
         to proceed in any court of proper jurisdiction or by self-help to
         exercise or prosecute the following remedies, as applicable (i) any
         rights to foreclose against any real or personal property or other
         security by exercising a power of sale granted under Credit
         Documents or under applicable law or by judicial foreclosure and
         sale, including a proceeding to confirm the sale; (ii) any rights
         of self-help including peaceful occupation of real property and
         collection of rents, set-off, and peaceful possession of personal
         property; (iii) obtaining provisional or ancillary remedies
         including injunctive relief, sequestration, garnishment,
         attachment, appointment of receiver and filing an involuntary
         bankruptcy proceeding; and (iv) when applicable, a judgment by
         confession of judgment. Preservation of these remedies does not
         limit the power of an arbitrator to grant similar remedies that may
         be requested by a party in a Dispute.

                  (c) The parties hereto agree that they shall not have a
         remedy of punitive or exemplary damages against the other in any
         Dispute and hereby waive any right or claim to punitive or
         exemplary damages they have now or which may arise in the future in
         connection with any Dispute whether the Dispute is resolved by
         arbitration or judicially.

                  (d) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
         the parties hereto accepts, for itself and in connection with its
         properties, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive
         jurisdiction relating to any arbitration proceedings conducted
         under the Arbitration Rules in New York, New York and irrevocably

         SECTION 9.16 CONFIDENTIALITY.
                      ---------------

         The Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders agrees that it
will use its reasonable best efforts not to disclose without the prior
consent of the Borrower (other than to its employees, affiliates, auditors
or counsel or to another Lender) any information with respect to the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement,
any other Credit Document or any documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein and which is designated by the Borrower to the Lenders in
writing as confidential or as to which it is otherwise reasonably clear such
information is not public, except that any Lender may disclose any such
information (a) as has become generally available to the public other than
by a breach of this Section 9.16, (b) as may be required or appropriate in
any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or
