         2.1.1 Revolving Loan Commitment. (a) Each Revolving Lender agrees to
make loans on a revolving basis ("Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from time to
time until the Termination Date in such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage
of such aggregate amounts as the Borrower may request, provided that (x) the
Revolving Outstandings will not, at any time, exceed the Revolving Commitment
Amount and (y) 130% of the Outstandings will not, at any time, exceed the
Borrowing Base and (b) (i) the Fronting Lender agrees from time to time until
the Termination Date to issue Drafting Agreements to Manufacturers for the
account of the Borrower and any Subsidiary (other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries
and Excluded Subsidiaries and except that, for so long as any Ford Restriction
exists, the Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to enter into a Drafting
Agreement with Ford), as more fully set forth in Sections 2.4 through 2.6, and
to permit Manufacturers that are parties to Drafting Agreements to make Drafts
on accounts of the Fronting Lender in accordance with such Drafting Agreements
(it being understood that the Fronting Lender may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, accept Drafts from Manufacturers and Auction Houses that are not
parties to Drafting Agreements), and (ii) as more fully set forth in Section
2.7.2, each Revolving Lender agrees to purchase a participation in each such
Drafting Agreement and each such Draft, provided that (x) the Revolving
Outstandings will not at any time exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount and (y)
130% of the Outstandings will not, at any time, exceed the Borrowing Base. As
more fully described in Section 2.7.1(a), the Borrower agrees to reimburse the
Fronting Lender for each Draft made against it and each reimbursement obligation
of the Borrower with respect thereto shall be automatically refunded with a
Revolving Loan.

         2.1.2 Term Loan Commitment. Each Term Lender made a term loan (the
"Term Loans") to the Borrower on the Initial Closing Date in such Term Lender's
Term Percentage of $100,000,000. It is understood and agreed that the Term Loans
were disbursed to the Borrower

                                       17

<PAGE>

under the Existing Credit Agreement and that no other Term Loans will be made
available to the Borrower under this Agreement.

         2.1.3 Swing Line Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Fronting Lender may from time to time, in its sole and absolute
discretion, make loans to the Borrower (collectively the "Swing Line Loans" and
individually each a "Swing Line Loan") in an aggregate amount not at any time
exceeding $200,000,000; provided that (x) the Revolving Outstandings will not at
any time exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount and (y) 130% of the Outstandings
will not, at any time, exceed the Borrowing Base. Swing Line Loans may be made
by the Fronting Lender notwithstanding the fact that such Loans, when aggregated
with the Fronting Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans, exceeds its Revolving
Commitment.

         2.2 Loan Procedures. The Borrower may request a Loan (and in the case
of a Draft presented under clause (i) and a Swing Line Loan funded pursuant to
the EFT System under clause (iii), the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Loan) (i) subject to Sections 2.4 through 2.7, in the case of a
Draft presented by a Manufacturer or an Auction House to the Fronting Lender (it
being understood that the Fronting Lender may, but shall have no obligation to,
accept any Draft presented by a Person not a party to any Drafting Agreement or
accept any Draft presented otherwise than in accordance with the terms of a
Drafting Agreement), (ii) in the case of Loans requested directly by the
Borrower, only after delivery to the Agent of written and oral notice of such
proposed borrowing as required pursuant to clause (b) below and (iii) in the
case of Swing Line Loans, by following the Fronting Lender's EFT System policies
and procedures, as communicated by the Fronting Lender to the Borrower from time
to time. Borrowings are subject to the following and to the remaining provisions
hereof:

                  (a)   Each notice of a proposed borrowing (other than in
         respect of Drafts presented to the Fronting Lender and in respect of
         Swing Line Loans) shall set forth the following information:

                        (i)     the proposed date of such borrowing, which shall
                  be a Business Day; and

                        (ii)    the aggregate amount of such borrowing.

                  (b)   Each such notice of borrowing (other than pursuant to
         the presentation of a Draft and with respect to Swing Line Loans) shall
         be given by telephonic notice to the Agent by 10:00 a.m., Detroit time,
         one Business Day prior to the proposed date of such borrowing and shall
         be confirmed in writing (including by facsimile transmission) to the
         Agent by 1:00 p.m. on such Business Day. Any telephonic notice of
         borrowing received after 10:00 a.m., Detroit time, shall be deemed to
         have been delivered by 10:00 a.m., Detroit time, on the next Business
         Day. Each notice of borrowing shall be irrevocable. On the Business Day
         of receipt of any such notice of borrowing (provided that any
         telephonic notice received after 10:00 a.m., Detroit time, shall be
         deemed received on the next Business Day), the Agent shall notify each
         Lender holding a Revolving Commitment of such notice. Not later than
         1:00 p.m., Detroit time, on the date of the proposed borrowing, each
         such Lender shall provide the Agent at the office specified by

                                       18

<PAGE>

         the Agent with immediately available funds covering such Lender's
         applicable Percentage of such borrowing.

                  (c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Fronting Lender
         has, at the request of the Required Lenders or acting in its discretion
         according to the terms hereof, taken action to suspend or terminate
         Drafts pursuant to a Drafting Agreement and such Drafting Agreement has
         in fact been suspended or terminated in accordance with its terms,
         then, subject to the terms of such Drafting Agreement, the Fronting
         Lender shall not fund any Draft under such Drafting Agreement.

                  (d)   In the case of each borrowing pursuant to the
         presentation of a Draft, the applicable Manufacturer or Auction House
         must follow the Fronting Lender's direct Drafting procedures as
         established and modified from time to time.

                  (e)   All Swing Line Loans shall be made through the EFT
         System pursuant to the Fronting Lender's EFT System policies and
         procedures, as communicated by the Fronting Lender to the Borrower from
         time to time.

         2.3 Title Documents. All original Manufacturer's invoices and title
documents evidencing the ownership by the Company and its Subsidiaries of all of
their Motor Vehicles, including the Manufacturer's Certificate, shall be
maintained in safekeeping by the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with
their standard operating policies and procedures as in effect on the Initial
Closing Date or as modified from time to time with the consent of the Agent. If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, within three Business Days
of request by the Agent, each of the Company and each Subsidiary, as the case
may be, shall deliver or cause to be delivered all original invoices and title
documents to the Agent and the Agent shall hold all original invoices and title
documents received by it after such request.

         2.4 Issuance of Drafting Agreements. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Fronting Lender shall, from time to time, upon
the written request of the Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary), issue Drafting Agreements
for the account of the Borrower or such Subsidiary; provided, that for so long
as any Ford Restriction exists, the Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to
enter into any Drafting Agreement with Ford.

         2.5 Conditions to Issuance; Termination of Drafting Agreements prior to
Termination Date. The Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to enter into or
issue a Drafting Agreement unless, as of the date of such Drafting Agreement:

                  (a)   the Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than an
         Unrestricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary) requesting such
         Drafting Agreement shall have delivered to the Fronting Lender a
         written application and such other documentation as the Fronting Lender
         may reasonably request, and the terms of such documents and of the
         proposed Drafting Agreement shall satisfy the terms hereof and
         otherwise be satisfactory to the Fronting Lender; it being understood
         that, the Fronting Lender shall, within three Business Days after the
         Borrower has provided the Fronting Lender with the name of the
         Manufacturer to which such proposed Drafting Agreement relates, provide
         the Borrower

                                       19

<PAGE>

         with the Drafting Agreement proposed by the Fronting Lender for such
         Manufacturer; and

                  (b)   the representations and warranties contained in this
         Agreement and in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in
         all material respects as if made on such date and, both immediately
         before and after issuance of such Drafting Agreement, no Unmatured
         Event of Default or Event of Default shall exist.

         Each application for a Drafting Agreement issued by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary)
hereunder shall constitute certification by the Borrower of the matters set
forth in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), and the Fronting Lender shall be
entitled to rely on such certification without further inquiry.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as any Ford Restriction exists,
the Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to enter into any Drafting Agreement
with Ford.

         The Fronting Lender shall take such action as necessary to terminate
all Drafting Agreements and all other Drafting arrangements (whether written or
oral) within five Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

         2.6 Notice of Issuance of or Entering into Drafting Agreements. The
Fronting Lender shall give notice to each Revolving Lender of the issuance of,
or the entering into of, each Drafting Agreement not later than five Business
Days after issuance of, or the entering into of, each such Drafting Agreement,
attaching a copy of such Drafting Agreement, as issued or entered into.

         2.7 Draft Procedures.

         2.7.1 Generally. (a) Each Draft submitted by a Manufacturer or an
Auction House shall constitute a notice of borrowing of a Revolving Loan, and
upon the funding of each such Draft, the Fronting Lender shall be deemed to have
disbursed to or on behalf of the Borrower, in payment of the obligations of the
Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary in respect of such funded Draft, a
Revolving Loan, bearing interest at the Interest Rate. The Borrower shall be
irrevocably obligated to reimburse the Fronting Lender on demand for the amount
of any Draft presented by a Manufacturer or an Auction House; provided, however
that such reimbursement obligation shall be deemed satisfied by the funding of
Revolving Loans with respect thereto and shall be subject to Section 2.7.3.

                  (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
         Borrower shall bear all risk of loss resulting from the payment of any
         Draft, or any resulting disbursement of a Revolving Loan, whether or
         not due to the negligence, misconduct or fraud of any Manufacturer or
         Auction House.

                  (c)   The Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to terminate
         or suspend the Drafting privileges of any Manufacturer or Auction House
         under any Drafting Agreement or pursuant to any other Drafting
         arrangement (whether in writing or oral) even though the aggregate
         amount of Drafts that may be presented by such Manufacturer or Auction
         House under such Drafting Agreement or pursuant to such other Drafting
         arrangement

                                       20

<PAGE>

         may exceed the availability in effect (under such Drafting Agreement,
         such other Drafting arrangement or this Agreement) from time to time.
         Furthermore, (i) any limitation contained in any Drafting Agreement
         (whether in respect of daily Drafts to be presented or otherwise) or
         other Drafting arrangement is, for the purposes hereof, for
         informational purposes only and the Fronting Lender shall not be
         obligated to monitor or limit the amount of Drafts presented or honored
         on the basis of any such limitation and (ii) any right of the Fronting
         Lender, acting in its discretion and not at the direction or with the
         concurrence of the Required Lenders, to terminate or suspend Drafting
         privileges of any Manufacturer or Auction House or to otherwise
         exercise any right or remedy shall be for the sole benefit and
         protection of the Fronting Lender, and the Fronting Lender shall not
         owe any duty to any other Lender with respect to such rights or
         remedies or be required to exercise such rights or remedies to protect
         any other Lender.

                  (d)   The Fronting Lender (in its sole and absolute
         discretion) may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any Draft
         presented by a Person not a party to any Drafting Agreement and/or
         accept any Draft presented otherwise than in accordance with the terms
         of a Drafting Agreement.

         2.7.2 Participations in Drafting Agreements and Drafts; Funding.
Concurrently with the issuance of each Drafting Agreement and/or the funding of
each Draft (other than the funding of any Draft that is a Fronting Lender
Advance), the Fronting Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to
each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and
unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Fronting Lender, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of
such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage, in such Drafting Agreement or
funded Draft and the Borrower's reimbursement obligations with respect thereto,
which participation shall be funded by each Revolving Lender making the
Revolving Loans specified in this Section or otherwise funding its participation
if Revolving Loans may not then be made. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
unparticipated portion of each Drafting Agreement or funded Draft shall be
deemed to be the Fronting Lender's "participation" therein. If the Fronting
Lender makes any payment or disbursement under any Draft, the Revolving Lenders
will, upon receipt of notice of such payment or disbursement from the Agent,
immediately (and by no later than 2:00 p.m., Detroit time, on the Business Day
of receipt of such notice if such Revolving Lender receives such notice by 10:00
a.m., Detroit time, on such Business Day, otherwise by 2:00 p.m., Detroit time,
on the following Business Day) and without any request by or notice to the
Borrower, provide for the payment of any reimbursement obligations due to the
Fronting Lender by making Revolving Loans (in accordance with their respective
Revolving Percentages) in the amount thereof, the proceeds of which Revolving
Loans shall be paid to the Agent to be paid over to the Fronting Lender;
provided that if for any reason the Revolving Lenders may not then make
Revolving Loans, then instead of making Revolving Loans each Revolving Lender
(other than the Fronting Lender) shall become immediately obligated to fund its
participation in all funded Drafts and shall pay to the Agent for the account of
the Fronting Lender an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Revolving
Percentage of such funded Drafts. Further, if, after the time any Fronting
Lender Advance is made by the Fronting Lender, the Revolving Outstandings are
less than the Revolving Commitment Amount, then, to the extent of such
deficiency, such Fronting Lender Advance shall cease to be a Fronting Lender
Advance and each Revolving Lender shall transfer to the Agent for the benefit of
the Fronting Lender such Revolving Lender's Revolving

                                       21

<PAGE>

Percentage of such deficiency as a Revolving Loan (such advance of funds by such
Revolving Lender shall be made to the Agent by 2:00 p.m., Detroit time, on the
Business Day of receipt of the notice referred to below, if it receives notice
from the Agent of such deficiency by 10:00 a.m., Detroit time, on such Business
Day, otherwise such Revolving Lender shall transfer such funds by 2:00 p.m.,
Detroit time, on the following Business Day); provided that if for any reason
the Revolving Lenders may not then make Revolving Loans, then instead of making
Revolving Loans each Revolving Lender (other than the Fronting Lender) shall
become immediately obligated to fund its participation in such Fronting Lender
Advances that have ceased to be the same and shall pay to the Agent for the
account of the Fronting Lender an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's
Revolving Percentage of such Fronting Lender Advances that have ceased to be the
same. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders set forth in the two immediately
preceding sentences are irrevocable and unconditional as more fully set forth in
Section 2.7.4. All interest that accrues or is earned on any Revolving Lender's
participation interest in any funded Draft or Fronting Lender Advance prior to
the date that such Revolving Lender fully funds such participation interest, as
set forth above, shall be paid to and retained by the Fronting Lender for its
own account. Until the Fronting Lender has been paid the full amount of any
Revolving Lender's participation interest in any funded Draft or Fronting Lender
Advance, any principal payments that are to be applied to such funded Draft or
Fronting Lender Advance shall be paid to and retained by the Fronting Lender for
its own account. Any Revolving Lender's failure to make available to the Agent
its Revolving Percentage of any such payment or disbursement shall not relieve
any other Revolving Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the
Agent such other Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of such payment, but no
Revolving Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Revolving
Lender to make available to the Agent such other Revolving Lender's Revolving
Percentage of any such payment or disbursement.

         2.7.3 Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Borrower to
reimburse the Fronting Lender for Drafts accepted hereunder, and to repay any
Revolving Loan funded to pay a Draft, shall be unconditional and irrevocable,
and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under
all circumstances, including: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (b) any change in the time, manner
or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations
of the Borrower in respect of any Draft or any Drafting Agreement or any other
Drafting arrangement (whether in writing or oral) or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document; (c) the existence
of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Company, the Borrower or
any other Subsidiary may have at any time against any Manufacturer or Auction
House or any other beneficiary or transferee of any Draft or Drafting Agreement
or other Drafting arrangement (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or
such transferee may be acting), the Fronting Lender or any other Person, whether
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the other Loan Documents or any unrelated transaction; (d) any Draft or any
demand, certificate or other document presented to the Fronting Lender proving
to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect, or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or any loss or
delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make
a Draft; (e) any payment by the Fronting Lender on any Draft pursuant to any
Drafting Agreement or other Drafting arrangement against presentation of a Draft
or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of any Drafting
Agreement or other Drafting arrangement or any payment made by the Fronting
Lender under any Draft to any

                                       22

<PAGE>

trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of a successor to any
beneficiary or any transferee of any Draft, including any arising in connection
with any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding; (f) any exchange, release or
non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or
consent to departure from all or any of the obligations of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary in respect of any Draft or Drafting Agreement or other Drafting
arrangement; or (g) any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the
Fronting Lender for a Draft accepted hereunder or to repay any Revolving Loan
funded to pay such funded Draft if the Fronting Lender engaged in willful
misconduct in accepting such Draft. For the avoidance of doubt, the following
actions or failures to act shall not, in and of themselves, be willful
misconduct by the Fronting Lender: (i) accepting a Draft without requesting or
reviewing supporting documentation from the Person submitting such Draft, (ii)
failing to monitor or limit the amount of Drafts presented or honored or (iii)
providing incorrect information as to the availability in effect under any
Drafting Agreement, any other Drafting Arrangement (whether in writing or oral)
or this Agreement.

         2.7.4 Participation Obligations Unconditional. Each Revolving Lender's
obligation to make available to the Agent for the account of the Fronting Lender
the amount of its participation interest in any funded Draft or Fronting Lender
Advance as provided in Section 2.7.2 shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Revolving Lender may
have against the Fronting Lender or any other Person, (ii) the occurrence or
continuance of an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default, (iii) any
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, (iv) any termination of the Commitments, (v) whether or not
the conditions specified in Section 10 have been satisfied or (vi) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever.

         2.7.5 Repayment of Participations. Upon (and only upon) receipt by the
Agent for the account of the Fronting Lender of immediately available funds from
or on behalf of the Borrower (a) in reimbursement of any funded Draft or
Fronting Lender Advance with respect to which a Revolving Lender has paid the
Agent in full for the account of the Fronting Lender the amount of such
Revolving Lender's participation therein or (b) in payment of any interest on a
funded Draft or Fronting Lender Advance with respect to which a Revolving Lender
has paid the Agent in full for the account of the Fronting Lender the amount of
such Revolving Lender's participation therein, the Agent will pay to such
Revolving Lender its pro rata share (according to its Revolving Percentage)
thereof (and the Fronting Lender shall receive the amount otherwise payable to
any Revolving Lender which did not so pay the Agent the amount of such Revolving
Lender's participation in such funded Draft or Fronting Lender Advance). All
interest that accrues or is earned on any Revolving Lender's participation
interest in any funded Draft or Fronting Lender Advance prior to the date that
such Revolving Lender fully funds its participation interest, as set forth above
in Section 2.7.2, shall be paid to and retained by the Fronting Lender for its
own account. Until the Fronting Lender has been paid the full amount of any
Revolving Lender's participation interest in any funded Draft or Fronting Lender
Advance, any principal payments that are to be applied to such funded Draft or
Fronting Lender Advance shall be paid to and retained by the Fronting Lender for
its own account.

         2.8 Swing Line Loan Procedures.

         2.8.1 Generally. Concurrently with the making of each Swing Line Loan,
the Fronting Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each
Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and
unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Fronting Lender, an
undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such other Revolving
Lender's Revolving Percentage, in such Swing Line Loan (but such participation
shall remain unfunded until required to be funded pursuant to Section 2.8.2).

         2.8.2 Refunding of, or Funding of Participations in, Swing Line Loans.
The Fronting Lender may at any time, in its sole discretion, on behalf of the
Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Fronting Lender to act on its
behalf) deliver a notice to the Agent requesting that each Revolving Lender
(including the Fronting Lender in its individual capacity) make a Revolving Loan
in such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount of Swing
Line Loans outstanding on such date for the purpose of repaying all Swing Line
Loans (and, upon receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans, the Agent
shall apply such proceeds to repay Swing Line Loans) (each Revolving Lender
shall make its advance under this Section by no later than 2:00 p.m., Detroit
time, on the Business Day of receipt of such notice of borrowing pursuant to
this Section if such Revolving Lender receives such notice by 10:00 a.m.,
Detroit time, on such Business Day, otherwise by 2:00 p.m., Detroit time, on the
following Business Day); provided that if for any reason the Revolving Lenders
may not then make Revolving Loans, then instead of making Revolving Loans each
Revolving Lender (other than the Fronting Lender) shall become immediately
obligated to fund its participation in all outstanding Swing Line Loans and
shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Fronting Lender an amount equal to
such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of such Swing Line Loans. Any
Revolving Lender's failure to make available to the Agent its Revolving
Percentage of the amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not relieve
any other Revolving Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the
Agent such other Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of such amount, but no
Revolving Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Revolving
Lender to make available to the Agent such other Revolving Lender's Revolving
Percentage of any such amount.

         2.8.3 Repayment of Participations. Upon (and only upon) receipt by the
Agent for the account of the Fronting Lender of immediately available funds from
or on behalf of the Borrower (a) in reimbursement of any Swing Line Loan with
respect to which a Revolving Lender has paid the Agent in full for the account
of the Fronting Lender the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation
therein or (b) in payment of any interest on a Swing Line Loan with respect to
which a Revolving Lender has paid the Agent in full for the account of the
Fronting Lender the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation therein, the
Agent will pay to such Revolving Lender its pro rata share (according to its
Revolving Percentage) thereof (and the Fronting Lender shall receive the amount
otherwise payable to any Revolving Lender which did not so pay the Agent the
amount of such Revolving Lender's participation in such Swing Line Loan). All
interest that accrues or is earned on any Revolving Lender's participation
interest in any Swing Line Loan prior to the date that such Revolving Lender
fully funds its participation interest, as set forth above in Section 2.8.2,
shall be paid to and retained by the Fronting Lender for its own account. Until
the Fronting Lender has been paid the full amount of any Revolving Lender's
participation interest in any Swing Line Loan, any principal payments

                                       24

<PAGE>

that are to be applied to such Swing Line Loan shall be paid to and retained by
the Fronting Lender for its own account.

         2.8.4 Participation Obligations Unconditional. Each Revolving Lender's
obligation to make available to the Agent for the account of the Fronting Lender
the amount of its participation interest in all Swing Line Loans as provided in
Section 2.8.2 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense
or other right that such Revolving Lender may have against the Fronting Lender
or any other Person, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default
or Unmatured Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, (iv) any
termination of the Commitments, (v) whether or not the conditions specified in
Section 10 have been satisfied or (vi) any other circumstance, happening or
event whatsoever.

         2.9 Fronting Lender Advances. The Fronting Lender is authorized by the
Borrower and the Lenders, from time to time in the Fronting Lender's sole and
absolute discretion, to accept Drafts in an amount that would cause the
Revolving Outstandings to exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount (the amount by
which any such Draft would so cause the Revolving Outstandings to exceed the
Revolving Commitment Amount being a "Fronting Lender Advance"). To the extent
that the funding of any such Draft does not cause the Revolving Outstandings to
exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount, no Fronting Lender Advance shall be
created and such Draft shall constitute part of the Revolving Outstandings. The
Fronting Lender Advances shall be secured by the Collateral Documents and
guarantied under Section 14 and under the Guaranty.

         2.10 Commitments Several. The failure of any Lender to make a requested
Loan on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation (if any)
to make a Loan on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Lender to make any Loan to be made by such other Lender.

         2.11 Certain Conditions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Loan (other than
Revolving Loans funded to pay to the Fronting Lender the participation
obligations of the Revolving Lenders in respect of Drafts and Swing Line Loans
and Revolving Loans to repay Fronting Lender Advances that have ceased to be the
same, all as set forth above), and the Fronting Lender shall not have any
obligation to issue any Drafting Agreement, fund any Draft or make a Swing Line
Loan, if an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

         2.12 Extension of Termination Date. The Termination Date shall be
automatically extended on each anniversary of the Initial Closing Date for one
year unless the Borrower or any Lender shall notify the Agent in writing prior
to such anniversary that it does not wish to extend the Termination Date for an
additional year (such notice a "No-Extension Notice"). The Agent shall promptly
provide written notice of its receipt of a No-Extension Notice to the other
parties hereto.

                                       25

<PAGE>

         SECTION 3. NOTES EVIDENCING LOANS.

         3.1 Notes. The Loans of each Lender shall be evidenced by a promissory
note (each a "Note") substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, with
appropriate insertions, payable to the order of such Lender in full on the
Termination Date; provided that no new Notes will be issued to the Lenders on
the Amendment Effective Date as the promissory notes issued to the Lenders on
the Initial Closing Date continue in full force and effect.

         3.2 Recordkeeping. Each Lender shall record in its records, or at its
option on the schedule attached to its Note, the date and amount of each Loan
made by such Lender and each repayment thereof. The aggregate unpaid principal
amount so recorded shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the principal
amount owing and unpaid on such Note. The failure to so record any such amount
or any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Note to
repay the principal amount of the Loans evidenced by such Note together with all
interest accruing thereon.

         SECTION 4. INTEREST.

         4.1 Interest Rate. The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Loan for the period commencing on the date of such Loan
until such Loan is paid in full at the applicable Interest Rate.

         4.2 Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be
payable in arrears for each month on the 10th Business Day of the next
succeeding month and at maturity. After maturity (whether as a result of
acceleration or otherwise), accrued interest on all Loans shall be payable on
demand.

         4.3 Computation of Interest. Interest shall be computed for the actual
number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days.

         SECTION 5. FEES.

         5.1 Agent's Fee. Each Lender hereto that is not DCSNA acknowledges and
agrees that the Agent may deduct from interest payments received by it from the
Borrower an amount equal to 0.15% per annum of the daily unpaid principal amount
of the Loans of such Lender for the period from the later of the Amendment
Effective Date or the last day on which such fee was paid to the date the Agent
receives such interest as payment of the Agent's fee hereunder, and that all
payments of interest to such Lenders by the Agent shall be net of such amount;
it being understood and agreed that prior to the Amendment Effective Date, the
reference to 0.15% per annum was a reference to 0.10% per annum and that such
percentage (i.e., 0.10% per annum) applied to the period prior to the Amendment
Effective Date.

         5.2 Computation of Fees. All fees hereunder shall be computed for the
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days.

                                       26

         SECTION 6. REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING COMMITMENT AMOUNT;
                    PREPAYMENTS.

         6.1 Voluntary Reduction or Termination of Revolving Commitment Amount.
The Borrower may from time to time on at least one Business Day's prior written
notice to the Agent (which shall promptly advise each Lender thereof)
permanently reduce the Revolving Commitment Amount to an amount not less than
the Revolving Outstandings. Concurrently with any reduction of the Revolving
Commitment Amount to zero, the Borrower shall pay all interest on the Revolving
Loans and shall Cash Collateralize in full all amounts estimated by the Fronting
Lender as being potentially payable under all Drafting Agreements and all other
Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral) then existing with any
Manufacturer or Auction House. All reductions of the Revolving Commitment Amount
shall reduce the Revolving Commitments pro rata among the Revolving Lenders
according to their respective Revolving Percentages.

         6.2 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may, with no advance notice,
from time to time prepay the Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and Fronting
Lender Advances, if such prepayment is effected through the EFT System (it being
understood and agreed that payments through the EFT System must be entered and
transmitted by no later than 3:00 p.m., Detroit time, on a Business Day);
provided that if the Borrower makes a prepayment on the Revolving Loans, Swing
Line Loans or Fronting Lender Advances other than through the EFT System or, if
the Revolving Outstandings immediately prior to such prepayment exceed
$100,000,000, in an amount that would reduce the Revolving Outstandings to (or
to an amount less than) $100,000,000 (even if such payment is effected through
the EFT System), it must give the Agent notice no later than 12:00 p.m., Detroit
time, on the Business Day prior to the date of such prepayment; provided,
further, that all prepayments pursuant to this sentence may be made without
premium or penalty and are permitted to be made in order to prepay the Revolving
Loans, Swing Line Loans and Fronting Lender Advances, in whole or in part. The
Borrower may, by giving notice to the Agent no later than 12:00 p.m., Detroit
time, on the Business Day prior to the date of prepayment, but only if no
Fronting Lender Advances, Swing Line Loans or Revolving Loans are outstanding,
prepay the entire (but not less than the entire) outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loans, without premium or penalty. Each prepayment pursuant to this
Section shall be made together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment on the principal amount paid. Reference is made to Section 7.2
for the application of prepayments pursuant to this Section.

         6.3 Mandatory Prepayments. (a) If on any day 130% of the Outstandings
exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, before the close of business on
the following Business Day, prepay Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate
such excess or prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize all Drafting Agreements
and all other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral) with
Manufacturers and Auction Houses in an amount determined by the Agent in its
sole and absolute discretion.

         (b)   If on any day on which the Revolving Commitment Amount is reduced
pursuant to Section 6.1, the Revolving Outstandings exceed the Revolving
Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans in an
amount sufficient to eliminate such excess or prepay Revolving Loans and/or Cash
Collateralize all Drafting Agreements and all

                                       27

<PAGE>

other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral) with Manufacturers and
Auction Houses in an amount determined by the Agent in its sole and absolute
discretion.

         SECTION 7. MAKING AND PRORATION OF PAYMENTS; SETOFF; TAXES.

         7.1 Making of Payments. All payments by the Borrower of (a) interest on
any Loans and (b) principal on any Fronting Lender Advance, Swing Line Loan or
Revolving Loan, may be effected through the EFT System by 3:00 p.m., Detroit
time, on the date due; provided that if the Borrower makes a payment of interest
on any Loan or a payment of principal on any Fronting Lender Advance, Swing Line
Loan or Revolving Loan other than through the EFT System, such payment must be
made by the Borrower to the Agent in immediately available funds at the office
specified by the Agent not later than 12:00 p.m., Detroit time, on the date due
and funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received by the
Agent on the following Business Day. All payments of principal on the Term Loans
must be made by the Borrower to the Agent in immediately available funds at the
office specified by the Agent not later than 12:00 p.m., Detroit time, on the
date due; provided that the Borrower will be permitted to make payments of
principal on the Term Loans through the EFT System if (i) the Borrower gives the
Agent notice of its intention to effect such payment through the EFT System at
least two Business Days prior to the date of such payment (and specifies in such
notice the date such payment is to be made, which shall be a Business Day) and
(ii) such payment is effected through the EFT System not later than 12:00 p.m.,
Detroit time, on the date specified in such notice. The Agent shall promptly
remit to each Lender its share of all such payments received in collected funds
by the Agent for the account of such Lender.

         7.2 Application of Certain Payments.

         7.2.1 At all times that an Event of Default does not exist, each
payment of principal (including prepayments under Section 6.2 or 6.3) shall be
applied first, to Fronting Lender Advances, second, to Swing Line Loans and
funded Drafts for which Revolving Lenders have not yet funded their
participations, third, to the Revolving Loans and fourth, to Term Loans.
Concurrently with each remittance to any Lender of its share of any such
payment, the Agent shall advise such Lender as to the application of such
payment.

         7.2.2 Any payment made by the Borrower, at any time that the Revolving
Outstandings immediately prior to such payment exceed $100,000,000, that would
reduce the Revolving Outstandings to (or to an amount less than) $100,000,000
shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent on the Business Day
immediately following the date such payment is received by the Agent, unless the
Agent receives one Business Day's prior notice of such payment in accordance
with Section 6.2.

         7.3 Due Date Extension. If any payment of principal or interest with
respect to any of the Loans, or of any fees, falls due on a day which is not a
Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the immediately following
Business Day and, in the case of principal, additional interest shall accrue and
be payable for the period of any such extension.

         7.4 Setoff. The Company and the Borrower agree that the Agent and each
Lender have all rights of set-off provided by applicable law, and in addition
thereto, the Company and the

                                       28

<PAGE>

Borrower agree that at any time any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default exists, the Agent and each Lender may apply to the payment of any
obligations of the Borrower hereunder, whether or not then due, any and all
balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the Company and the Borrower
then or thereafter with the Agent or such Lender. The Agent or the Lender
exercising the set-off shall promptly notify the Company or the Borrower, as the
case may be, thereof after making such exercise; provided that failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of the set-off.

         7.5 Proration of Payments. Except to the extent that this Agreement
provides for payments to be allocated to Lenders under a particular credit
facility hereunder, if any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery
(whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise, but
excluding any payment pursuant to Section 13.9) on account of principal of or
interest on any Loan (or on account of its exposure under any Draft or Drafting
Agreement) in excess of its pro rata share of payments and other recoveries
obtained by all Lenders on account of principal of and interest on the Loans
then held by them, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Loans (or subparticipations in Drafts and Drafting
Agreements) held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender
to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them;
provided that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery.

         7.6 Taxes. All payments of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and
other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of any nature
whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, excluding franchise taxes and taxes
imposed on or measured by any Lender's net income or receipts (all non-excluded
items being called "Taxes"). If any withholding or deduction from any payment to
be made by the Borrower or the Company hereunder is required in respect of any
Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower or
the Company, as applicable, will:

                  (a)   pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount
         required to be so withheld or deducted;

                  (b)   promptly forward to the Agent an official receipt or
         other documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment
         to such authority; and

                  (c)   pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders such
         additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount
         actually received by each Lender will equal the full amount such Lender
         would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required.

Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against the Agent or any Lender
with respect to any payment received by the Agent or such Lender hereunder, the
Agent or such Lender may pay such Taxes and the Borrower or the Company, as
applicable, will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalty,
interest or expense) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by
such Person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such

                                       29

<PAGE>

additional amount) shall equal the amount such Person would have received had
such Taxes not been asserted.

         If the Borrower or the Company, as applicable, fails to pay any Taxes
when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent, for
the account of the respective Lenders, the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, the Borrower or the Company, as applicable, shall
indemnify the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may
become payable by any Lender as a result of any such failure. For purposes of
this Section 7.6, a distribution hereunder by the Agent or any Lender to or for
the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.

         Each Lender that (a) is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States of America or a state thereof and (b)(i) is a party
hereto on the Amendment Effective Date or (ii) becomes an assignee of an
interest under this Agreement under Section 13.9.1 after the Amendment Effective
Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to
such assignment) shall execute and deliver to the Borrower and the Agent one or
more (as the Borrower or the Agent may reasonably request) United States
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN or such other forms or
documents, appropriately completed, as may be applicable to establish that such
Lender is exempt from withholding or deduction of Taxes. The Borrower shall not
be required to pay additional amounts to any Lender pursuant to this Section 7.6
to the extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have
arisen but for the failure of such Lender to comply with this paragraph.

         SECTION 8. WARRANTIES.

         To induce the Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to
induce the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and participate in Drafting
Agreements issued hereunder and Drafts, and the Fronting Lender to issue
Drafting Agreements hereunder and fund Drafts presented to it, each of the
Borrower and the Company warrants to the Agent and the Lenders that:

         8.1 Organization. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia; each Subsidiary of
the Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization; and each of the Company and each Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where, because of the nature
of its activities or properties, such qualification is required, except for such
jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         8.2 Authorization; No Conflict. Each of the Borrower, the Company and
each other Loan Party is duly authorized to execute and deliver each Loan
Document to which it is a party, the Borrower is duly authorized to borrow
monies hereunder and each of the Borrower, the Company and each other Loan Party
is duly authorized to perform its obligations under each Loan Document to which
it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Borrower
and the Company of this Agreement and by each of the Borrower, the Company and
each other Loan Party of each other Loan Document to which it is a party, and
the borrowings by the Borrower hereunder, do not and will not (a) require any
consent or approval of any

                                       30

<PAGE>

governmental agency or authority (other than any consent or approval which has
been obtained and is in full force and effect), (b) conflict with (i) any
provision of law, (ii) the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of
the Borrower, the Company or any other Loan Party or (iii) any agreement,
indenture, instrument or other document, or any judgment, order or decree, which
is binding upon the Borrower, the Company or any other Loan Party or any of
their respective properties or (c) require, or result in, the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower, the Company, any Subsidiary
or any other Loan Party (other than Liens in favor of the Agent created pursuant
to the Collateral Documents).

         8.3 Validity and Binding Nature. Each of this Agreement and each other
Loan Document to which the Borrower, the Company or any other Loan Party is a
party is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person, enforceable
against such Person in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights
generally and to general principles of equity.

         8.4 Financial Condition. The audited consolidated financial statements
of the CarMax Group as at February 28, 2001 and the unaudited consolidated
condensed financial statements of the CarMax Group as at November 30, 2001,
copies of each of which have been delivered to the Agent for distribution to
each Lender, were prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject, in the case of such
unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) and
present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the CarMax Group as at
such dates and the results of its operations for the periods then ended.

         8.5 No Material Adverse Change. Since November 30, 2001 there has been
no material adverse change in the financial condition, operations, assets,
business, properties or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (it being understood that the separation of the CarMax Group from Circuit
City shall not be considered an adverse change).

         8.6 Litigation and Contingent Liabilities. No litigation (including
derivative actions), arbitration proceeding or governmental investigation or
proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower or the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary which might reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in Schedule 8.6.
Other than any liability incident to such litigation or proceedings, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any contingent liabilities not listed on Schedule
8.6.

         8.7 Ownership of Properties; Liens. Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary owns good and, in the case of real property, marketable title to all
of its properties and assets material to its business, real and personal,
tangible and intangible, of any nature whatsoever (including patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights), free and clear of all
Liens, charges and claims (including infringement claims with respect to
patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and the like) except for
Permitted Liens.

         8.8 Subsidiaries. As of the Amendment Effective Date, neither the
Borrower nor the Company has any Subsidiaries other than those listed on
Schedule 8.8.

         8.9 Pension Plans. (a) During the twelve-consecutive-month period prior
to the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of any
Loan or the issuance of any

                                       31

<PAGE>

Drafting Agreement, (i) no steps have been taken to terminate any Pension Plan
and (ii) no contribution failure has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan
sufficient to give rise to a Lien under Section 302(f) of ERISA. No condition
exists or event or transaction has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan
which could result in the incurrence by the Company or any Subsidiary of any
liability, fine or penalty that singly or in the aggregate could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)   All contributions (if any) have been made to any Multiemployer
Pension Plan that are required to be made by the Company or any other member of
the Controlled Group under the terms of the plan or of any collective bargaining
agreement or by applicable law; neither the Company nor any member of the
Controlled Group has withdrawn or partially withdrawn from any Multiemployer
Pension Plan, incurred any withdrawal liability with respect to any such plan or
received notice of any claim or demand for withdrawal liability or partial
withdrawal liability from any such plan, and no condition has occurred which, if
continued, might result in a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from any such
plan; and neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has
received any notice that any Multiemployer Pension Plan is in reorganization,
that increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan
benefits or the imposition of any excise tax, that any such plan is or has been
funded at a rate less than that required under Section 412 of the Code, that any
such plan is or may be terminated, or that any such plan is or may become
insolvent.

         8.10 Investment Company Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

         8.11 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"

Act of 1935.

         8.12 Regulation U. The Company is not engaged principally, or as one of
its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

         8.13 Taxes. Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has filed all
Federal and other material tax returns and reports required by law to have been
filed by it and has paid all taxes and governmental charges thereby shown to be
owing, except any such taxes or charges which are being diligently contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in
accordance with GAAP shall have been set aside on its books.

         8.14 Solvency, etc. On the Amendment Effective Date, and immediately

liabilities and (b) each of the Borrower, the Company and each other Loan Party
will be solvent, will be able to pay its debts as they mature, will own property

arising after the Amendment Effective Date, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received notice from any third party, including any Federal,

         11.1.8 Judgments. Final judgments which exceed an aggregate of
$5,000,000 shall be rendered against the Company or any Subsidiary and shall not
have been paid, discharged or vacated or had execution thereof stayed pending

         11.1.9 Invalidity of Guaranty, etc. The Guaranty shall cease to be in
full force and effect with respect to any Subsidiary party thereto, other than
by virtue of the release of such Subsidiary after sale thereof in a transaction

of such Subsidiary) shall contest in any manner the validity, binding nature or
enforceability of the Guaranty with respect to such Subsidiary; or the
provisions of Section 14 shall cease to be in full force and effect with respect
to the Company; or the Company (or any Person by, through or on behalf of the
Company) shall contest in any manner the validity, binding nature or
enforceability of the provisions of Section 14.

         11.1.10 Invalidity of Collateral Documents, etc. Any Collateral
Document shall cease to be in full force and effect; or the Company or any
Subsidiary (or any Person by, through or on behalf of the Company or any

enforceability of any Collateral Document.

         11.1.11 Change in Control. Any Change in Control shall occur.

         11.2 Effect of Event of Default. If any Event of Default described in
Section 11.1.4 shall occur, the Commitments (if they have not theretofore
terminated) shall immediately terminate and the Loans and all other obligations
hereunder shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrower shall become
immediately obligated to Cash Collateralize in full all amounts estimated by the
Fronting Lender as being potentially payable under all Drafting Agreements and
all other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral) then existing with
any Manufacturer or Auction House, all without presentment, demand, protest or
notice of any kind, and the Fronting Lender shall terminate all Drafting
Agreements and all other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral);
and, if any other Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, (i) the Agent
(upon written request of the Required Lenders) shall declare the Commitments (if
they have not theretofore terminated) to be terminated and/or declare all Loans
and all other obligations hereunder to be due and payable and/or demand that the
Borrower immediately Cash Collateralize in full all amounts estimated by the
Fronting Lender as being potentially payable under all Drafting Agreements and
all other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral) then existing with
any Manufacturer or Auction House, whereupon the Commitments (if they have not
theretofore terminated) shall immediately terminate and/or all Loans and all
other

                                       51

<PAGE>

obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable and/or the
Borrower shall immediately become obligated to Cash Collateralize in full all
amounts estimated by the Fronting Lender as being potentially payable under all
Drafting Agreements and all other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or
oral) then existing with any Manufacturer or Auction House, all without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind and (ii) the Fronting Lender
in its sole discretion may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall
(and, to the extent the Commitments have been terminated, such request shall be
deemed to have been made), terminate all Drafting Agreements and all other
Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral). The Agent shall promptly
advise the Borrower of any such declaration, but failure to do so shall not
impair the effect of such declaration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the effect
as an Event of Default of any event described in Section 11.1.1 or Section
11.1.4 may be waived by the written concurrence of all of the Lenders, and the
effect as an Event of Default of any other event described in this Section 11
may be waived by the written concurrence of the Required Lenders (except as
provided in Section 13.1). Any cash collateral delivered hereunder shall be held
by the Agent (without liability for interest thereon) and applied to obligations
arising in connection with any funding of any Draft. After the expiration or
termination of all Drafting Agreements and all other Drafting arrangements
(whether in writing or oral), such cash collateral shall be applied by the Agent
to any remaining obligations hereunder and any excess shall be delivered to the
Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

         SECTION 12. THE AGENT.

         12.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby irrevocably
(subject to Section 12.9) appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other
Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have
or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist
against the Agent.

         12.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

         12.3 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, employees or agents shall (i) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any
manner to any of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or
warranty made by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or
any officer thereof, contained in this

                                       52

<PAGE>

Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Borrower, the
Company or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any
Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of
the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

         12.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the
Borrower or the Company), independent accountants and other experts reasonably
selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
deems appropriate and, if it so requests, confirmation from the Lenders of their
obligation to indemnify the Agent against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders and such request
and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon
all of the Lenders.

         12.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest
and fees required to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless
the Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender, the Borrower or the
Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.
The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in
accordance with Section 11; provided that unless and until the Agent has
received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of
Default or Unmatured Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.

         12.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that the Agent has not
made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to

                                       53

<PAGE>

extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent,
the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with
any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial or other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, the
Company or any other Loan Party which may come into the possession of the Agent.

         12.7 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Agent and
its directors, officers, employees and agents (to the extent not reimbursed by
or on behalf of the Company and the Borrower and without limiting the obligation
of the Company and the Borrower to do so), pro rata, from and against any and
all Indemnified Liabilities; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any
payment to any such Person of any portion of the Indemnified Liabilities
resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand
for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney
Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Company and the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
repayment of the Loans, termination of the Commitments, cancellation of the
Notes, expiration or termination of the Drafting Agreements, any foreclosure
under, or modification, release or discharge of, any or all of the Collateral
Documents, termination of this Agreement and the resignation or replacement of
the Agent.

         12.8 Agent in Individual Capacity. DCSNA and its Affiliates may make
loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, acquire equity interests
in and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though DCSNA were not the Agent or the Fronting
Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, DCSNA or its Affiliates may
receive information regarding the Company or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the
Company or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to their Loans (if
any), DCSNA and its Affiliates shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though DCSNA were not
the Agent or the Fronting Lender, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include
DCSNA and its Affiliates, to the extent applicable, in their individual
capacities.

         12.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 120 days'
notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Agent resigns under this
Agreement, the Required Lenders shall, with (so long as no Event of Default
exists) the consent of the Borrower (which shall not

                                       54

<PAGE>

be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint from among the Lenders a successor
agent for the Lenders. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective
date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting
with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders.
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such
successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent, and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Section 12 and Sections 13.6 and 13.13 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for
above.

         12.10 Collateral Matters. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Agent,
at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by
the Agent under any Collateral Document (i) upon termination of the Commitments
and payment in full of all Loans and all other obligations of the Borrower
hereunder and the expiration or termination of all Drafting Agreements and all
other Drafting arrangements (whether in writing or oral); (ii) constituting
property sold or to be sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any
disposition permitted hereunder; or (iii) subject to Section 13.1, if approved,
authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders. Upon request by the
Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's authority to
release particular types or items of collateral pursuant to this Section 12.10.

         12.11 Funding Reliance. (a) Unless the Agent receives notice from a
Lender by noon, Detroit time, on the day of a proposed borrowing that such
Lender will not make available to the Agent an amount equal to its pro rata
share of such borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make a
corresponding amount available to the Borrower. If and to the extent such Lender
has not made such amount available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower
jointly and severally agree to repay such amount to the Agent forthwith on
demand, together with interest thereon at the interest rate applicable to Loans
comprising such borrowing or, in the case of any Lender which repays such amount
within three Business Days, the Federal Funds Rate. Nothing set forth in this
clause (a) shall relieve any Lender of any obligation it may have to make any
Loan hereunder.

                  (b)   Unless the Agent receives notice from the Borrower prior
         to the due date for any payment hereunder that the Borrower does not
         intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has
         made such payment and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
         to each Lender its share of such payment. If and to the extent that the
         Borrower has not made any such payment to the Agent, each Lender which
         received a share of such payment shall repay such share (or the
         relevant portion thereof) to the Agent forthwith on demand, together
         with interest thereon at the Interest Rate (or, in the case of any
         Lender which repays such amount within three Business Days, the

                                       55

<PAGE>

         Federal Funds Rate). Nothing set forth in this clause (b) shall relieve
         the Borrower of any obligation it may have to make any payment
         hereunder.

         SECTION 13. GENERAL.

         13.1 Waiver; Amendments. No delay on the part of the Agent or any
Lender in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any of them of any right,
power or remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy. No amendment, modification or waiver of, or
consent with respect to, any provision of this Agreement or the Notes shall in
any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed and
delivered by Lenders having an aggregate Total Percentage of not less than the
aggregate Total Percentage expressly designated herein with respect thereto or,
in the absence of such designation as to any provision of this Agreement or the
Notes, by the Required Lenders, and then any such amendment, modification,
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, the Lenders authorize the Agent to
act within its discretion (and without notice to or the consent of any Lender)
to waive or forbear on behalf of all Lenders any noncompliance by the Borrower
or the Company (other than a waiver of, or forbearance with respect to, any
Event of Default under Section 11.1.4 and other than a waiver of any Event of
Default under Section 11.1.1) with this Agreement (provided that no such waiver
shall be for a period in excess of 90 days). No amendment, modification, waiver
or consent shall change the Total Percentage of any Lender without the consent
of such Lender. No amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall (i) increase
the Revolving Commitment Amount, (ii) extend the date for payment of any
principal of or interest on the Loans or any fees payable hereunder, (iii)
reduce the principal amount of any Loan, the rate of interest thereon or any
fees payable hereunder, (iv) release the Guaranty, release the Company from the
provisions of Section 14 or release all or any substantial part of the
collateral granted under the Collateral Documents or (v) reduce the aggregate
Total Percentage required to effect an amendment, modification, waiver or
consent without, in each case, the consent of all Lenders. No provision of
Section 12 or other provision of this Agreement affecting the Agent in its
capacity as such shall be amended, modified or waived without the consent of the
Agent. No provision of this Agreement relating to the rights or duties of the
Fronting Lender in its capacity as such shall be amended, modified or waived
without the consent of the Fronting Lender.

         13.2 Confirmations. The Borrower and each holder of a Note agree from
time to time, upon written request received by it from the other, to confirm to
the other in writing (with a copy of each such confirmation to the Agent) the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans then outstanding under such Note.

         13.3 Notices. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.2, all notices
hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission) and shall be
sent to the applicable party at its address shown on Schedule 13.3 or at such
other address as such party may, by written notice received by the other
parties, have designated as its address for such purpose. Notices sent by
facsimile transmission shall be deemed to have been given when sent; notices
sent by mail shall be deemed to have been given three Business Days after the
date when sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid; and notices
sent by hand delivery or overnight courier service shall be deemed to have been
given when received. For purposes of Section 2.2, the Agent shall

                                       56

<PAGE>

be entitled to rely on telephonic instructions from any person that the Agent in
good faith believes is an authorized officer or employee of the Borrower, and
the Borrower shall hold the Agent and each other Lender harmless from any loss,
cost or expense resulting from any such reliance.

         13.4 Computations. Where the character or amount of any asset or
liability or item of income or expense is required to be determined, or any
consolidation or other accounting computation is required to be made, for the
purpose of this Agreement, such determination or calculation shall, to the
extent applicable and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, be made
in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied; provided that if the Company
notifies the Agent that the Company wishes to amend any covenant in Section 9 to
eliminate or to take into account the effect of any change in GAAP or any change
in the Company's application of GAAP on the operation of such covenant (or if
the Agent notifies the Company that the Required Lenders wish to amend Section 9
for such purpose), then the Company's compliance with such covenant shall be
determined on the basis of GAAP in effect immediately before the relevant change
in GAAP or the relevant change in the Company's application of GAAP became
effective, until either such notice is withdrawn or such covenant is amended in
a manner satisfactory to the Company and the Required Lenders. The Company may
notify the Agent of any one-time adjustments to its financial statements and
after the giving of such notice the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in
good faith to make arrangements (including, if the Agent determines the same is
necessary, entering into an amendment hereto) to take the consequences of such
adjustment into account.

         13.5 Regulation U. Each Lender represents that it in good faith is not
relying, either directly or indirectly, upon any Margin Stock as collateral
security for the extension or maintenance by it of any credit provided for in
this Agreement.

         13.6 Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Company and the Borrower jointly
and severally agree to pay on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Agent (including Attorney Costs) in connection with the
preparation, execution, syndication, delivery and administration of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and all other documents provided for herein
or delivered or to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith (including
any amendment, supplement or waiver to any Loan Document), and all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent and each
Lender after an Event of Default in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any such other documents. In addition,
the Company and the Borrower jointly and severally agree to pay, and to save the
Agent and the Lenders harmless from all liability for, (a) any stamp or other
taxes (excluding income taxes and franchise taxes based on net income) which may
be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
borrowings hereunder, the issuance of the Notes or the execution and delivery of
any other Loan Document or any other document provided for herein or delivered
or to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith and (b) any fees of the
Company's auditors in connection with any exercise by the Agent and the Lenders
of their rights pursuant to Section 9.2. All obligations provided for in this
Section 13.6 shall survive repayment of the Loans, termination of the
Commitments, cancellation of the Notes, expiration of the Drafting Agreements
and termination of this Agreement.

                                       57

<PAGE>

         13.7 Subsidiary References. The provisions of this Agreement relating
to Subsidiaries shall apply only during such times as the Company has one or
more Subsidiaries.

         13.8 Captions. Section captions used in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

         13.9 Assignments; Participations.

         13.9.1 Assignments. Any Lender may, with the prior written consent of
the Agent and (so long as no Event of Default exists) the Borrower (which
consents shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld and, in any event, shall
not be required for an assignment by a Lender to one of its Affiliates or to any
other Lender), at any time assign and delegate to one or more commercial banks
or other Persons (any Person to whom such an assignment and delegation is to be
made being herein called an "Assignee") all or any fraction of such Lender's
Loans and Commitment (which assignment and delegation shall be of a constant,
and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Lender's Loans and
Commitment) in a minimum aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount
of the assigning Lender's Revolving Percentage of the Revolving Commitment
Amount plus such Lender's Term Loans and (ii) $50,000,000; provided that (a) no
assignment and delegation may be made to any Person if, at the time of such
assignment and delegation, the Borrower would be obligated to pay any greater
amount under Section 7.6 to the Assignee than the Borrower is then obligated to
pay to the assigning Lender under such Section (and if any assignment is made in
violation of the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to pay the
incremental amounts) and (b) the Borrower and the Agent shall be entitled to
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the
interests so assigned and delegated to an Assignee until the date when all of
the following conditions shall have been met:

                  (x)   five Business Days (or such lesser period of time as the
         Agent and the assigning Lender shall agree) shall have passed after
         written notice of such assignment and delegation, together with payment
         instructions, addresses and related information with respect to such
         Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrower and the Agent by such
         assigning Lender and the Assignee,

                  (y)   the assigning Lender and the Assignee shall have
         executed and delivered to the Borrower and the Agent an assignment
         agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit G (an "Assignment
         Agreement"), together with any documents required to be delivered
         thereunder, which Assignment Agreement shall have been accepted by the
         Agent, and

                  (z)   except in the case of an assignment by a Lender to one
         of its Affiliates, the assigning Lender or the Assignee shall have paid
         the Agent a processing fee of $3,500.

From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met,
(x) such Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and
delegated to such Assignee pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the assigning Lender, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and
delegated by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released from
its obligations

                                       58

<PAGE>

hereunder. Within five Business Days after effectiveness of any assignment and
delegation, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Agent (for delivery to
the Assignee) a new Note (unless the Assignee was already a holder of a Note
immediately prior to such effectiveness). Each such Note shall be dated the
effective date of such assignment. Accrued interest on that part of the
predecessor Note being assigned shall be paid as provided in the Assignment
Agreement. Accrued interest and fees on that part of the predecessor Note not
being assigned shall be paid to the assigning Lender. Accrued interest and
accrued fees shall be paid at the same time or times provided in the predecessor
Note and in this Agreement. Any attempted assignment and delegation not made in
accordance with this Section 13.9.1 shall be null and void.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.9.1 or any
other provision of this Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign all or any
portion of its Loans and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank (but no such
assignment shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder).

         13.9.2 Participations. Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more
commercial banks or other Persons participating interests in any Loan owing to
such Lender, the Note held by such Lender, the Commitment of such Lender or any
other interest of such Lender hereunder (any Person purchasing any such
participating interest being herein called a "Participant"). In the event of a
sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, (x) such Lender
shall remain the holder of its Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (y) the
Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations hereunder and (z)
all amounts payable by the Borrower shall be determined as if such Lender had
not sold such participation and shall be paid directly to such Lender. No
Participant shall have any direct or indirect voting rights hereunder except
with respect to any of the events described in the fourth sentence of Section
13.1. Each Lender agrees to incorporate the requirements of the preceding
sentence into each participation agreement which such Lender enters into with
any Participant. The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this
Agreement and the Notes are due and payable (as a result of acceleration or
otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in
respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and
any Note to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement or such Note; provided
that such right of setoff shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant
to share with the Lenders, and the Lenders agree to share with each Participant,
as provided in Section 7.5. The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Section 7.6 as if it were a Lender (provided that
no Participant shall receive any greater compensation pursuant to Section 7.6
than would have been paid to the participating Lender if no participation had
been sold).

         13.10 Governing Law. This Agreement and each Note shall be a contract
made under and governed by the laws of the State of Michigan applicable to
contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State. Whenever possible
each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement
shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement. All obligations

                                       59

<PAGE>

of the Borrower and the Company and rights of the Agent and the Lenders
expressed herein or in any other Loan Document shall be in addition to and not
in limitation of those provided by applicable law.

         13.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts and
each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement.

         13.12 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Borrower, the Company, the Lenders and the Agent and their respective successors
and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Company, the
Lenders and the Agent and the successors and assigns of the Lenders and the
Agent.

         13.13 Indemnification by the Company and the Borrower. In consideration
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Agent and the Lenders and
the agreement to extend the Commitments provided hereunder, the Company and the
Borrower hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify, exonerate and hold the
Agent, each Lender and each of the officers, directors, employees, Affiliates
and agents of the Agent and each Lender (each a "Lender Party") free and
harmless from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, losses,
liabilities, damages and expenses, including Attorney Costs (collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"), incurred by the Lender Parties or any of them as a
result of, or arising out of, or relating to (i) any tender offer, merger,
purchase of stock, purchase of assets or other similar transaction financed or
proposed to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the
proceeds of any of the Loans, (ii) the use, handling, release, emission,
discharge, transportation, storage, treatment or disposal of any hazardous
substance at any property owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary,
(iii) any violation of any Environmental Law with respect to conditions at any
property owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary or the operations
conducted thereon, (iv) the investigation, cleanup or remediation of offsite
locations at which the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective
predecessors are alleged to have directly or indirectly disposed of hazardous
substances (it being understood that such indemnity shall not apply to the
extent any such liabilities are finally determined by a court to have been
caused by a Lender Party's involvement at such offsite location) or (v) the
execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document by any of the Lender Parties, except for any such Indemnified
Liabilities arising on account of the applicable Lender Party's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may
be unenforceable for any reason, the Company and the Borrower hereby jointly and
severally agree to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable
law. All obligations provided for in this Section 13.13 shall survive repayment
of the Loans, termination of the Commitments, cancellation of the Notes,
expiration of the Drafting Agreements, any foreclosure under, or any
modification, release or discharge of, any or all of the Collateral Documents
and termination of this Agreement.

         13.14 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other hand shall be solely
that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any
fiduciary responsibility to the Borrower or the

                                       60

<PAGE>

Company. Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the
Company or the Borrower to review or inform the Company or the Borrower of any
matter in connection with any phase of the Company's or the Borrower's business
or operations. Each of the Borrower and the Company agrees that neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower or the Company
(whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the
Borrower or the Company in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the
Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith,
unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought. Neither the Agent
nor any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and each of the
Borrower and the Company hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any
special, indirect or consequential damages suffered by the Borrower or the
Company in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

         13.15 Consent to Jurisdiction. EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON,
OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT. EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE COMPANY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO
THE SERVICE OF PROCESS BY REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, OR BY PERSONAL
SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY
SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT
ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

         13.16 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE COMPANY, THE
AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE,
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT
DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM ANY LENDING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH
ANY OF THE FOREGOING, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE
TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

         13.17 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to take, and to cause its
Affiliates to take, normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to
maintain the confidentiality of all non-public information provided to it by the
Company or any Subsidiary or by Circuit City, or by the Agent on the Company's
or any Subsidiary's or Circuit City's behalf, under this

                                       61

<PAGE>

Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither such Lender nor any of its
Affiliates shall use any such information other than in connection with or in
enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with
other business now or hereafter existing or contemplated with the Company or any
Subsidiary or Circuit City, except to the extent such information was or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such
Lender or was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Company, a Subsidiary or Circuit City (provided that such source
is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary
known to such Lender); provided, however, that any Lender may disclose such
information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any
governmental authority to which such Lender is subject or in connection with an
examination of such Lender by any such authority, (B) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process, when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of
any applicable requirement of law, (C) to the extent reasonably required in
connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Agent or any Lender or
any of their respective Affiliates may be party, (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, (E) to such Lender's independent auditors and other
professional advisors, (F) to any participant or assignee, actual or potential,
provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep such information
confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders hereunder, (G) as to any
Lender or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under the terms of any other
document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which the Company, any
Subsidiary or Circuit City is party or is deemed party with such Lender or such
Affiliate, (H) to its Affiliates and (I) to any nationally recognized rating
agency that requires access to information about such Lender's investment
portfolio in connection with ratings issued to such Lender.

         SECTION 14. GUARANTY.

         14.1 The Guaranty. The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees (as primary obligor and not merely as surety) to the Lenders and the
Agent, and to each of them, the due and punctual payment, observance and
performance of all of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise, according to the
terms hereof and thereof, and the Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
agrees to cause payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations to be made
punctually as and when the same shall become due upon demand. This guaranty
shall be of payment and performance and not of collection merely.

         14.2 Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of the Company under this
Section 14 shall be continuing, unconditional and absolute and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:

                  (a)   any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver
         or release in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation, by operation of law
         or otherwise;

                  (b)   any modification or amendment of or supplement to any
         Loan Document;

                                       62

<PAGE>

                  (c)   any modification, amendment, waiver, release,
         non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security, or of
         any Guarantee or other liability of any third party, for any Guaranteed
         Obligation;

                  (d)   any change in the corporate existence, structure or
         ownership of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or any insolvency,
         bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the
         Borrower or any other Loan Party or its assets or any resulting release
         or discharge of any Guaranteed Obligation;

                  (e)   the existence of any claim, setoff or other right which
         the Company may have at any time against the Borrower, the Agent, any
         Lender or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection with
         the Loan Documents;

                  (f)   any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or
         against the Borrower or any other Loan Party for any reason of the
         whole or any provision of any Loan Document, or any provision of
         applicable law purporting to prohibit the payment or performance by the
         Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations; or

                  (g)   any other act or omission of any kind to act or delay by
         the Borrower, any other Loan Party, the Agent, any Lender or any other
         Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the
         provisions of this Section 14.2, constitute a legal or equitable
         discharge of the obligations of the Company under this Section 14.

         14.3 Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain
Circumstances. The Company's obligations under this Section 14 shall remain in
full force and effect until all of the Commitments shall have expired or been
terminated and all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full in
cash. If at any time all or any part of any payment previously applied to any
Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise,
the obligations of the Company under this Section 14 with respect to such
payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had not been
made at such time.

         14.4 Waiver. The Company irrevocably waives acceptance hereof,
presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as
any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the
Borrower or any other Person or any collateral. The Company hereby expressly
waives (a) notice of the acceptance by the Agent or any Lender of this Section
14 and (b) notice of the existence or creation or nonpayment of all or any of
the Guaranteed Obligations.

         14.5 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of
any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is stayed upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts
otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Loan Documents shall
nonetheless be payable by the Company hereunder forthwith on demand by the
Agent.

         14.6 Delay of Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by or for
the account of the Company pursuant to this Section 14, the Company shall not be
subrogated to any right of

                                       63

<PAGE>

the Agent or any Lender until such time as the Agent and each Lender shall have
received final payment in cash of the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                     SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO
                                SUBORDINATED DEBT

The indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated debt (the "Subordinated Debt")
shall at all times be wholly subordinate and junior in right or payment to any
and all Superior Indebtedness (as defined below) in the manner and with the
force and effect hereafter set forth:

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company/1/, or of any execution sale, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding relating to the Company or its
property, all principal, interest, fees, reimbursement obligations and other
amounts owing on all Superior Indebtedness shall first be paid in cash in full
before any payment is made upon the indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated
Debt; and in any such event any payment or distribution of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than in securities or
other evidences of indebtedness, the payment of which is subordinated to the
same extent as the indebtedness evidenced hereby to the payment of all Superior
Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding) which shall be made upon or
in respect of the Subordinated Debt shall be paid over to the holders of such
Superior Indebtedness, pro rata, for application in payment thereof until such
Superior Indebtedness shall have been paid or satisfied in cash in full.

(b) During the continuance of any default in any agreement pursuant to which any
Superior Indebtedness is issued which arises from the failure to pay when due
(whether by acceleration or otherwise) any principal of, premium, if any,
interest on, fees or other amounts in respect of such Superior Indebtedness (a
"Superior Payment Default"), no payment of principal, premium or interest shall
be made on the Subordinated Debt.

(c) During the continuance of any event of default or unmatured event of default
in any agreement pursuant to which any Superior Indebtedness is issued other
than a Superior Payment Default (a "Superior Non-Payment Default") as to which
the Company has received notice in writing from any holder or holders of
Superior Indebtedness, no payment of principal, premium or interest shall be
made on the Subordinated Debt for a period (each, a "Payment Blockage Period")
commencing on the date of receipt by the Company of such notice and terminating
on the earliest to occur of the following dates: (i) the date of acceleration of
the Superior Indebtedness, (ii) 180 days after the Company's receipt of such
written notice, (iii) the date such Superior Non-Payment Default shall have been
cured or waived, or shall have ceased to exist, (iv) the date the Superior
Indebtedness shall have been discharged or paid in full in cash or (v) the date
such Payment Blockage Period shall have been terminated by written notice to the
Company from the holder or holders of Superior Indebtedness initiating such
Payment Blockage Period, after which, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv)
and (v), the Company shall resume making payments in respect of the Subordinated
Debt, unless clause (a) or (b) above is then applicable.

----------
/1/  For purposes of this Exhibit, "Company" is the issuer of the Subordinated
     Debt.

(d) If the Subordinated Debt is declared or becomes due and payable because of
the occurrence of any default thereunder or under the agreement or instrument
under which it is issued or otherwise than at the option of the Company, under
circumstances when clause (a) above shall not be applicable, the holders of the
Subordinated Debt shall not be entitled to payments until sixty (60) days after
such event and then only if such payment is permitted under clauses (a) and (b)
above.

(e) The holder of the Subordinated Debt undertakes and agrees for the benefit of
each holder of Superior Indebtedness to execute, verify, deliver and file any
proof of claim, consent, assignment or other instrument which any holder of
Superior Indebtedness may at any time require in order to prove and realize upon
any right or claim pertaining to the Subordinated Debt and to effectuate the
full benefit of the subordination contained herein; and upon failure of the
holder of the Subordinated Debt so to do prior to thirty (30) days before the
expiration to file such claim any such holder of Superior Indebtedness shall be
deemed to be irrevocably appointed the agent and attorney-in-fact of the holder
of the Subordinated Debt to execute, verify, deliver and file any such proof of
claim, consent, assignment or other instrument.

(f) No right of any holder of any Superior Indebtedness to enforce subordination
as herein provided shall at any time or in any way be affected or impaired by
any failure to act on the part of the Company or any holder of Superior
Indebtedness, or by any non-compliance by the Company with any term, provision
or covenant of the subordinated notes or the agreement under which they are
issued, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Superior
Indebtedness may have or be otherwise charged with.

(g) The Company agrees, for the benefit of the holders of Superior Indebtedness,
that in the event that the Subordinated Debt is declared due and payable before
its expressed maturity because of the occurrence of a default thereunder or
under the agreement under which it was issued, the Company will give prompt
notice in writing of such happening to the holders of Superior Indebtedness.
