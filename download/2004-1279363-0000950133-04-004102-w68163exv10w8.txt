      2.5   Renegotiation

            The parties to this Agreement shall have the right and obligation to
            renegotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement in the event
            applicable local, state or federal law, regulations or policy are
            altered from those existing at the time of this Agreement in order
            to be in continuous compliance therewith. This Section shall not
            limit the right of the parties to this Agreement to renegotiate or
            amend other terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such changes
            shall only be made with the consent of the parties and the prior
            approval of the DHHS.

      2.6   Assignment and Subcontracting

            a)    The Contractor shall not, without SDOH's prior written
                  consent, assign, transfer, convey, sublet, or otherwise

                  interest, obligations, or duties under the Agreement; of the
                  Contractor's power to execute the Agreement; or, by power of
                  attorney or otherwise, of any of the Contractor's rights to
                  receive monies due or to become due under this Agreement. SDOH
                  agrees that it will not unreasonably withold consent of the
                  Contractor's assignment of this Agreement, in whole or in
                  part, to a parent, affiliate or subsidiary corporation, or to
                  a transferee of all or substantially all of its assets. Any
                  assignment, transfer, conveyance, sublease, or other

                  other services as are acceptable to SDOH. If such written

                  management services under 10 NYCRR Part 98.11, it must be
                  approved by SDOH prior to its becoming effective. Any
                  subcontract entered into by Contractor shall fulfill the
                  requirements of 42 CFR Parts 434 and 438 to the extent such

                        G)    changes the provider network, such that Enrollees
                              access to the Contractor's services is no longer
                              consistent with the standards set forth in
                              Sections 15, 21 and 22 and Appendix I of this

                              participating in procurement activities.

                  ii)   The SDOH will notify the Contractor of its intent to
                        terminate this Agreement for the Contractor's failure to
                        meet the requirements of this Agreement and provide

                  Rates. In such event, the party exercising its right shall
                  give the other party written notice specifying the reason for
                  and the effective date of termination, which shall not be less
                  time than will permit an orderly disenrollment of Enrollees or
                  transfer to another MCO, but no more than ninety (90) days.

            c)    Contractor Initiated Termination

                  i)    The Contractor shall have the right to terminate this
                        Agreement in the event that SDOH materially breaches the
                        Agreement or fails to comply with any term or condition
                        of this Agreement that is not cured within twenty (20)
                        days, or within such longer period as the parties may
                        agree, of the Contractor's written request for
                        compliance. The Contractor shall give SDOH written
                        notice specifying the reason for and the effective date
                        of the termination, which shall not be less time than
                        will permit an orderly disenrollment of Enrollees or
                        transfer to another managed care program, but no more
                        than ninety (90) days.

                  ii)   The Contractor shall have the right to terminate this
                        Agreement in the event that its obligations are
                        materially changed by modifications to this Agreement
                        and its Appendices by SDOH. In

<PAGE>

                        such event, Contractor shall give SDOH written notice
                        within thirty (30) days of notification of changes to
                        the Agreement or Appendices specifying the reason and
                        the effective date of termination, which shall not be
                        less time than will permit an orderly disenrollment of
                        Enrollees or transfer to another MCO, but no more than
                        ninety (90) days.

                  iii)  The Contractor shall also have the right to terminate
                        this Agreement if the Contractor is unable to provide
                        services pursuant to this Agreement because of a natural
                        disaster and/or an act of God to such a degree that
                        Enrollees cannot obtain reasonable access to services
                        within the Contractor's organization, and, after
                        diligent efforts, the Contractor cannot make other
                        provisions for the delivery of such services. The
                        Contractor shall give SDOH written notice of any such
                        termination that specifies:

                        A)    the reason for the termination, with appropriate
                              documentation of the circumstances arising from a
                              natural disaster and/or an act of God that
                              preclude reasonable access to services;

                        B)    the Contractor's attempts to make other provision
                              for the delivery of services; and

                        C)    the effective date of the termination, which shall
                              not be less time than will permit an orderly
                              disenrollment of Enrollees or transfer to another
                              MCO, but no more than ninety (90) days.

            d)    Termination Due To Loss of Funding

                  In the event that State and/or Federal funding used to pay for
                  services under this Agreement is reduced so that payments
                  cannot be made in full, this Agreement shall automatically
                  terminate, unless both parties agree to a modification of the
                  obligations under this Agreement. The effective date of such
                  termination shall be ninety (90) days after the Contractor
                  receives written notice of the reduction in payment, unless
                  available funds are insufficient to continue payments in full
                  during the ninety (90) day period, in which case SDOH shall
                  give the Contractor written notice of the earlier date upon
                  which the Agreement shall terminate. A reduction in State
                  and/or Federal funding cannot reduce monies due and owing to
                  the Contractor on or before the effective date of the
                  termination of the Agreement.

                  relating to this Agreement, made by a certified public

            e)    The Contractor shall establish an appropriate plan acceptable
                  to and prior approved by the SDOH for the orderly

                  plan shall include the provision of pertinent information to
                  identified Enrollees who are: pregnant; currently receiving
                  treatment for a chronic or life threatening condition; prior

                  monitored by a case manager to assist them in making decisions
                  which will promote continuity of care.

            f)    The Contractor shall allow an Enrollee who has entered the
                  second trimester of pregnancy to continue treatment with a

                  i)    accept reimbursement from the Contractor at rates
                        established by the Contractor as payment in full, which
                        rates shall be no more than the level of reimbursement
                        applicable to similar providers within the Contractor's
                        network for such services;

3.    COMPENSATION

      3.1   Capitation Payments

            Compensation to the Contractor shall consist of a monthly capitation
            payment for each Enrollee and the Supplemental Maternity Capitation
            Payment where applicable.

            a)    In no event shall monthly capitation payments to the
                  Contractor for the Benefit Package exceed the cost of
                  providing the Benefit Package on a fee-for-service basis to an
                  actuarially equivalent, non-enrolled population group Upper
                  Payment Limit (UPL) as determined by SDOH.

            b)    The monthly Capitation Rates are attached hereto as Appendix L
                  and shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without
                  further action by the parties.

            c)    The monthly capitation payments and the Supplemental Maternity
                  Capitation Payment to the Contractor shall constitute full and
                  complete payments to the Contractor for all services that the
                  Contractor provides pursuant to this Agreement.

            d)    Capitation Rates shall be effective for the entire Agreement
                  period, except as described in Section 3.2.

      3.2   Modification of Rates During Agreement Period

            a)    Any technical modification to Capitation Rates during the term
                  of the Agreement as agreed to by the Contractor, including but
                  not limited to, changes to the Benefit Package, shall be
                  deemed incorporated into this Agreement without further action
                  by the parties, upon approval and written notice to the
                  Contractor by SDOH.

            b)    Any other modification to Capitation Rates, as agreed to by
                  SDOH and the Contractor during the term of the Agreement shall
                  be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without further
                  action by the parties upon approval of such modifications by
                  the SDOH and the State Division of the Budget.

            c)    In the event that SDOH and the Contractor fail to reach
                  agreement on modifications to the monthly Capitation Rates,
                  the SDOH will provide formal written notice to the Contractor
                  of the amount and effective date of the modified Capitation
                  Rates approved by the State Division of the Budget. The
                  Contractor shall have the option of terminating this Agreement
                  if such approved modified Capitation Rates are not acceptable.
                  In such case, the Contractor shall give written notice to

                               FHPlus - Section 3
                                 (COMPENSATION)

<PAGE>

                  the SDOH within thirty (30) days of the date of the formal
                  written notice of the modified Capitation Rates from SDOH
                  specifying the reasons for and effective date of termination.
                  The effective date of termination shall be ninety (90) days
                  from the date of the Contractor's written notice, unless the
                  SDOH determines that an orderly transfer to another MCO can be
                  accomplished in fewer days. During the period commencing with
                  the effective date of the SDOH modified Capitation Rates
                  through the effective date of termination of the Agreement,
                  the Contractor shall have the option of continuing to receive
                  capitation payments at the expired Capitation Rates or at the
                  modified Capitation Rates approved by SDOH and State Division
                  of the Budget for the rate period.

                  If the Contractor fails to exercise its right to terminate in
                  accordance with this Section, then the modified Capitation
                  Rates approved by SDOH and the State Division of the Budget
                  shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without
                  further action by the parties as of the effective date of the
                  modified Capitation Rates as established by SDOH and approved
                  by State Division of the Budget.

      3.3   Rate Setting Methodology

            Capitation Rates are determined using a prospective methodology
            whereby cost, utilization and other rate-setting data available for
            the time period prior to the time period covered by the rates are
            used to establish premiums. Capitation rates will not be
            retroactively adjusted to reflect actual fee-for-service data or
            plan experience for the time period covered by the rates.

      3.4   Payment of Capitation

            a)    The monthly capitation payments for each Enrollee are due to
                  the Contractor from the Effective Date of Enrollment until the
                  Effective Date of Disenrollment of this Enrollee or
                  termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs first. The
                  Contractor shall receive a full month's capitation payment for
                  the month in which disenrollment occurs. The Roster generated
                  by SDOH with any modification communicated electronically or
                  in writing by the LDSS or the Enrollment Broker prior to the
                  end of the month in which the Roster is generated, shall be
                  the enrollment list for purposes of MMIS premium billing and
                  payment, as discussed in Section 6.7 and Appendix H.

            b)    Upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a properly completed claim
                  for monthly capitation payments submitted by the Contractor
                  pursuant to this Agreement, the Fiscal Agent will promptly
                  process such claim for payment through MMIS and use its best
                  efforts to complete such

                  Contractor claims shall be in compliance with the requirements
                  of 42 CFR Section 447.45. The Fiscal Agent will also use its
                  best efforts to resolve any billing problem relating to the
                  Contractor's claims as soon as possible. In accordance with
                  Section 41 of the State Finance Law, the State and LDSS shall
                  have no liability under this Agreement to the Contractor or
                  anyone else beyond funds appropriated and available for
                  payment of Family Health Plus care, services and supplies.

      3.5   Denial of Capitation Payments

            If the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) denies payment
            for new Enrollees, as authorized by Social Security Act (SSA)
            Section 1903(m)(5) and 42 CFR Section 434.67, or such other
            applicable federal statutes or regulations, based upon a
            determination that Contractor failed substantially to provide
            medically necessary items and services, imposed premium amounts or
            charges in excess of permitted payments, engaged in discriminatory
            practices as described in SSA Section 1932(e)(1)(A)(iii),
            misrepresented or falsified information submitted to HCFA, SDOH,
            LDSS, the Enrollment Broker, or an Enrollee, potential Enrollee, or
            health care provider, or failed to comply with federal requirements
            (i.e. 42 CFR Section 417.479 and 42 CFR Section 434.70) relating to
            the Physician Incentive Plans, SDOH will deny capitation payments to
            the Contractor for the same Enrollees for the period of time for
            which HCFA denies such payment.

      3.6   SDOH Right to Recover Premiums

            The parties acknowledge and accept that the SDOH has a right to
            recover premiums paid to the Contractor for Enrollees listed on the
            monthly Roster who are later determined for the entire applicable
            payment month, to have been in an institution; to have been
            incarcerated; to have moved out of the Contractor's service area
            subject to any time remaining in the Enrollee's Guaranteed
            Eligibility period; or to have died. In any event, the State may
            only recover premiums paid for FHPlus Enrollees listed on a Roster
            if it is determined by the SDOH that the Contractor was not at risk
            for provision of Benefit Package services for any portion of the
            payment period.

      3.7   Third Party Health Insurance Determination

            The Contractor and the LDSS will make diligent efforts to determine
            whether Enrollees have third party health insurance (TPHI). The LDSS
            shall use its best efforts to maintain third party information on
            the WMS/MMIS Third Party Resource System. The Contractor shall make
            good faith efforts to coordinate benefits with and collect TPHI
            recoveries from other insurers, and must inform the LDSS of any
            known changes in

                               FHPlus - Section 3
                                 (COMPENSATION)

<PAGE>

            status of TPHI insurance eligibility within thirty (30) days of
            learning of a change in TPHI. The Contractor may use the Roster as
            one method to determine TPHI information. The Contractor will be
            permitted to retain 100 percent of any reimbursement for Benefit
            Package services obtained from TPHI. Capitation Rates are net of
            TPHI recoveries. In no instances may an Enrollee be held responsible
            for disputes over these recoveries.

      3.8   Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment

            a)    The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and services
                  included in the Benefit Package associated with the maternity
                  care of an Enrollee.

            b)    In instances where the Enrollee is Enrolled in the
                  Contractor's plan under Family Health Plus on the date of the
                  delivery of a child, the Contractor shall be entitled to
                  receive a Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment. The
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment reimburses the
                  Contractor for the inpatient and outpatient costs of services
                  normally provided as part of maternity care including
                  antepartum care, delivery and post-partum care. The
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment is in addition to
                  the monthly Capitation Rate paid by the SDOH to the Contractor
                  for the Enrollee.

            c)    In instances where the Enrollee was enrolled in the
                  Contractor's plan under Family Health Plus for only part of
                  the pregnancy, but was enrolled on the date of the delivery of
                  the child, the plan shall be entitled to receive the entire
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment. The Supplemental
                  Capitation payment shall not be pro-rated to reflect that the
                  Enrollee was not a member of the Contractor's plan for the
                  entire duration of the pregnancy.

            d)    In instances where the Enrollee was enrolled in the
                  Contractor's plan under Family Health Plus for part of the
                  pregnancy, but was not enrolled on the date of the delivery of
                  the child, the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive the
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment, or any portion
                  thereof.

            e)    Costs of inpatient and outpatient care associated with
                  maternity cases that end in termination or miscarriage shall
                  be reimbursed to the Contractor through the monthly Capitation
                  Rate for the Enrollee and the Contractor shall not receive the
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment.

            f)    The Contractor must maintain on file evidence of payment of
                  the delivery, plus any other inpatient and outpatient services
                  for the maternity care of the Enrollee to be eligible to
                  receive a Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment. Failure
                  to have supporting records may, upon audit, result in
                  recoupment of the Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment by
                  the SDOH.

      3.9   Contractor Financial Liability

            Contractor shall not be financially liable for any services rendered
            to an Enrollee prior to his or her Effective Date of Enrollment in
            the Contractor's plan.

      3.10  Reinsurance

            The Contractor shall purchase reinsurance coverage unless it can
            demonstrate to SDOH's satisfaction the ability to self-insure. The
            cost of purchasing reinsurance shall be allowed in the calculation
            of capitation rates, provided that such costs are determined to be
            reasonable by the SDOH. Recoveries from reinsurance shall also be
            reflected in the Contractor's financial reports as a reduction to
            claims experience and shall be considered in the calculation of
            capitation rates.

      3.11  Enrollment Limitations

            a)    The Contractor may enroll up to the county specific provider
                  network capacity limits determined by SDOH, provided that the
                  Contractor's statewide enrollment does not exceed the MCO's
                  financial capacity as determined annually by SDOH, or more
                  frequently as deemed necessary by SDOH.

            b)    SDOH shall have the right, upon consultation with LDSS as it
                  deems appropriate, to limit, suspend or terminate enrollment
                  activities by the Contractor and/or enrollment into the
                  Contractor's plan upon ten (10) days written notice to the
                  Contractor, specifying the actions contemplated and the
                  reason(s) for such action(s). Nothing in this paragraph limits
                  other remedies available to the SDOH under this Agreement.

4.    SERVICE AREA

      For purposes of this Agreement, the Contractor's service area shall
      consist of the county(ies) described in Appendix M of this Agreement,
      which is hereby made a part of this Agreement as if set forth fully
      herein. The Contractor must request written SDOH approval to expand its
      service area for purposes of providing FHPlus services. In no event,
      however, shall the Contractor provide services to the expanded service
      area until it has received such approval. Any modifications made to
      Appendix M as a result of an approved request to expand the Contractor's
      service area shall become effective fifteen (15) days from the date of the
      written SDOH approval without the need for further action on the part of
      the parties to this Agreement.

            b)    In addition to the responsibilities set forth in Appendix H,
                  the Contractor is responsible for doing all of the following
                  with respect to newborns:

                        discharge from the hospital, in those instances in which
                        the Contractor has received appropriate notification of
                        the birth prior to discharge.

            c)    The SDOH and LDSSs shall be responsible for ensuring that

                  Effective Date of Enrollment. This may be accomplished through

                  the event that the actual Effective Date of Enrollment
                  changes, the Contractor must notify the Enrollee of the
                  change.

            b)    As of the Effective Date of Enrollment, and until the

                        enrollment form to enroll in the Contractor's plan, and
                        who remains hospitalized on or after the Effective Date
                        of Enrollment.

                  iii)  An Enrollee's Effective Date of Enrollment shall be the
                        first day of the month on which the Enrollee's name
                        appears on the PCP roster for that month.

      6.7   Roster

            a)    The combination of the first and second monthly Rosters
                  generated by SDOH shall serve as the official Contractor
                  enrollment list for purposes of MMIS premium billing and
                  payment, subject to ongoing eligibility of the Enrollees as of
                  the first (1st) day of the enrollment month. Modifications to
                  the first (1st) Roster may be made electronically or in
                  writing by the LDSS or the Enrollment Broker, where
                  applicable, prior to the end of the month in which the Roster
                  is generated.

            b)    LDSSs shall make data on eligibility determinations available
                  to the Contractor and SDOH to resolve discrepancies that may
                  arise between the Roster and the Contractor's enrollment files
                  in accordance with the provisions in Appendix H, Section D.

            c)    If LDSSs or the Enrollment Broker notify the Contractor in
                  writing or electronically of changes in the first (1st) Roster

                  the Contractor's Medicaid Managed Care Plan, if the Contractor
                  also participates in the Medicaid managed care program in the
                  individual's county of fiscal responsibility, and the Enrollee

            Enrollees are subject to a twelve (12) month Initial Enrollment
            Period following the Effective Date of Enrollment in the

                  iii)  Enrollee, MCO, and LDSS agree that a change of MCO is in
                        the best interest of the Enrollee.

                  from the Contractor's plan during the Initial Enrollment
                  Period if she chooses to receive health insurance coverage
                  through Medicaid.

                  initiated by the Enrollee, an LDSS, or the Contractor under
                  the conditions specified in Sections 8.4, 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9
                  and as detailed in Appendix H, Sections D and E of this

            c)    The SDOH may modify Appendix H of this Agreement upon sixty
                  (60) days prior written notice to the Contractor and such
                  modifications shall become binding and incorporated into this
                  Agreement without further action.

            d)    LDSSs shall make the final determination concerning
                  disenrollments, except for Contractor-initiated disenrollments
                  and expedited disenrollments, which may be subject to SDOH
                  approval as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

      8.2   Disenrollment Prohibitions

            Disenrollment shall not be based in whole or in part on any of the
            following reasons:

            a)    an existing condition or a change in the Enrollee's health.

            b)    any of the factors listed in Section 34 of this Agreement; or

            c)    on the Capitation Rate payable to the Contractor related to
                  the Enrollee's participation with the Contractor.

      8.3   Reasons for Voluntary Disenrollment

            An LDSS or the Contractor, as agreed upon between the LDSS and
            Contractor, shall provide Enrollees who disenroll voluntarily with
            an opportunity to identify, in writing, their reason(s) for
            disenrollment.

      8.4   Processing of Disenrollment Requests

            a)    Routine Disenrollment

                               FHPlus - Section 8
                                 (DISENROLLMENT)

                                       8-1

<PAGE>

            Unless otherwise specified in Appendix H, Section E, disenrollment
            requests will be processed to take effect on the first (1st) day of
            the next month if the request is made before the date specified in
            Appendix H. In no event shall the Effective Date of Disenrollment be
            later than the first (1st) day of the second (2nd) month after the
            month in which an Enrollee requests a disenrollment.

            b)    Expedited Disenrollment

                  i)    Enrollees with an urgent medical need to disenroll from
                        the Contractor's plan may request an expedited
                        disenrollment by an LDSS or the SDOH. Substantiation of
                        the request by the SDOH or the LDSS will result in an
                        expedited disenrollment in accordance with the
                        guidelines and timeframes as set forth in Appendix H.
                        The LDSS will make this decision unless the LDSS
                        delegates this responsibility to the SDOH.

                  ii)   Enrollees may request an expedited disenrollment by an
                        LDSS or the SDOH based on a complaint of Non-consensual
                        Enrollment. Substantiation of such a request by an LDSS
                        or the SDOH shall result in an expedited disenrollment
                        which may be effected retroactive to the first day of
                        the month of enrollment, if deemed by the SDOH or the
                        LDSS and the Enrollee to be in the best interest of the
                        Enrollee.

            c)    Retroactive Disenrollment

            Retroactive disenrollments may be warranted in rare instances and
            include when an Enrollee is later determined to have entered and
            stayed in a residential institution; to have been incarcerated; to
            have moved out of the county of fiscal responsibility, subject to
            any time remaining in the Enrollee's guaranteed eligibility period;
            or to have died as long as the Contractor was not at risk for
            provision of Benefit Package Services for any portion of the
            retroactive period.

      8.5   Contractor Notification of Disenrollments

            a)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Roster,
                  along with any changes sent by an LDSS to the Contractor in
                  writing or electronically, shall serve as official notice to
                  the Contractor of disenrollment of an Enrollee. In cases of
                  expedited and retroactive disenrollment, the Contractor shall
                  be notified of the Enrollee's effective date of disenrollment
                  by the LDSS.

            b)    In the event that an LDSS intends to retroactively disenroll
                  an Enrollee on a date prior to the first day of the month of
                  the disenrollment request, the LDSS shall consult with the
                  Contractor prior to

                               FHPlus - Section 8
                                 (DISENROLLMENT)
                                 October 1, 2001

<PAGE>

                  disenrollment. Such consultation shall not be required for the
                  retroactive disenrollment in cases where it is clear that the
                  Contractor was not at risk for the provision of Benefit
                  Package services for any portion of the retroactive period.

            c)    In all cases of retroactive disenrollment, including
                  disenrollments effective the first day of the current month,
                  an LDSS must notice the plan at the time of disenrollment, of
                  the Contractor's responsibility to submit to the SDOH's Fiscal
                  Agent voided premium claims for any months of retroactive
                  disenrollment where the Contractor was not at risk for the
                  provision of Benefit Package services during the month.

      8.6   Contractor's Liability

            The Contractor is not responsible for providing the Benefit Package
            under this Agreement after the Effective Date of Disenrollment
            unless the Enrollee is admitted to a hospital prior to the expected
            Effective Date of Disenrollment and is not discharged from the
            hospital until after the expected Effective Date of Disenrollment,
            in which case the Contractor is responsible for the entire hospital
            claim. The Contractor shall notify the LDSS that the Enrollee
            remains in the hospital and provide the LDSS with information
            regarding his or her medical status. The Contractor is required to
            cooperate with the Enrollee and the new MCO (if applicable) on a
            timely basis to ensure a smooth transition and continuity of care.

      8.7   Enrollee Initiated Disenrollment

            a)    Disenrollment For Good Cause

                  i)    An Enrollee may initiate disenrollment from the
                        Contractor's plan for "good cause" as that term is
                        defined by the SDOH at any time during the Initial
                        Enrollment Period and may disenroll from the FHPlus plan
                        for any reason at any time after the twelfth (12th)
                        month following the Effective Date of Enrollment.

                  ii)   An Enrollee may initiate disenrollment for "good cause"
                        by filing a written request with the LDSS or the
                        Contractor. The Contractor must notify the LDSS of the
                        request. The LDSS must respond with a determination
                        within thirty (30) days after receipt of the request.

                  iii)  Enrollees granted disenrollment for "good cause" may
                        join another FHPlus plan, if one is available.

                  iv)   In the event that the LDSS denies an Enrollee's request
                        for disenrollment for "good cause", the LDSS must inform
                        the Enrollee of the denial of the request with a written
                        notice which explains the reason for the denial, states
                        the facts upon which denial is based, cites the
                        statutory and regulatory authority and advises the
                        Enrollee of his or her right to a fair hearing pursuant
                        to 18 NYCRR Part 358.

                               FHPlus - Section 8

<PAGE>

                        In the event that the Enrollee's request to disenroll is
                        approved, the notice must state the Effective Date of
                        Disenrollment.

                  v)    Once the FHPlus Initial Enrollment Period has expired,
                        an Enrollee may disenroll from the Contractor's plan at
                        any time, for any reason.

            b)    Disenrollment Based on Pregnancy

                  A pregnant Enrollee may initiate disenrollment from the
                  Contractor's plan to receive Medicaid coverage.

      8.8   Contractor Initiated Disenrollment

            a)    Contractor initiated disenrollment(s) will be limited to
                  circumstances in which there is clear and consistent
                  documentation that the individual's behavior is verbally or
                  physically abusive and/or causes harm to other Enrollees or to
                  the plan providers and staff, or is repeatedly non -
                  compliant. Disenrollment may not be initiated due to an
                  Enrollee's refusal to accept a specific treatment nor for
                  behavior resulting from an underlying medical condition,
                  alcohol or substance abuse, mental illness, mental retardation
                  or other developmental disability.

            b)    To request disenrollment to an Enrollee, the Contractor must
                  do the following if applicable:

                  i)    show evidence of professional evaluation ruling out an
                        underlying medical condition, alcohol or substance
                        abuse, mental illness, mental retardation or other
                        developmental disability as cause for Enrollee behavior.

                  ii)   document difficulty encountered with the Enrollee;
                        nature, extent and frequency of abusive or harmful
                        behavior, violence, inability to treat or engage
                        client.

                  iii)  identify and document unique issues that may be
                        affecting the Contractor's ability to provide treatment
                        effectively to certain Enrollees as well as the
                        appropriateness of providers in network.

                  iv)   document special training offered to providers to
                        improve their ability to deal with difficult,
                        non-compliant patients, or those having the above
                        mentioned conditions.

            c)    The Contractor must make a reasonable effort to identify for
                  the Enrollee, both verbally and in writing, those actions of
                  the Enrollee that have interfered with the effective provision
                  of covered services as well as explain what actions or
                  procedures are acceptable. In the event the Contractor is the
                  sole FHPlus MCO in the county, the notice must explain the
                  ramifications of losing FHPlus coverage.

            d)    The Contractor shall give prior verbal and written notice to
                  the Enrollee, with a copy to the LDSS, of its intent to
                  request disenrollment. The notice shall advise the Enrollee
                  that the request has been forwarded to the LDSS for review
                  and approval. The written notice must include the mailing
                  address and telephone number of the LDSS.

            e)    The Contractor shall keep he LDSS informed of decisions
                  related to all complaints filed by an Enrollee as a result of,
                  or subsequent to, the notice of intent to disenroll.

            f)    The SDOH or LDSS will review each Contractor initiated
                  disenrollment request in accordance with protocols established
                  by SDOH. Where applicable, as set out in those protocols, an
                  LDSS or the SDOH, through or with the cooperation of the LDSS,
                  shall consult with local mental health and substance abuse
                  authorities in the County when making the determination to
                  approve or disapprove a Contractor initiated disenrollment
                  request.

            g)    An LDSS will render a decision within thirty (30) days of
                  receipt of the disenrollment request. A final written
                  determination will be provided to the Enrollee and the
                  Contractor. If the LDSS determination upholds the Contractor's
                  request to disenroll, the LDSS's written determination must
                  inform the Enrollee of the Effective Date of Disenrollment and
                  include a notice of the right to a fair hearing. If an
                  Enrollee requests a fair hearing as a result of the LDSS
                  determination, the LDSS shall inform the Contractor of the
                  fair hearing request and the Enrollee will remain enrolled in
                  the Contractor's plan until disposition of the fair hearing.

            h)    Once an Enrollee has been disenrolled at the Contractor's
                  request, he/she will not be re-enrolled with the Contractor's
                  plan unless the Contractor first agrees to such re-enrollment.

            i)    In New York City, the Metropolitan Regional Office of the SDOH
                  will assume the LDSS responsibility for reviewing and
                  approving requests as set forth in Sections 8.8(f) and (g) of
                  this Agreement.

      8.9   LDSS Initiated Disenrollment

            a)    An LDSS will promptly initiate disenrollment when:

                  i)    an Enrollee is no longer eligible for FHPlus; or

                        and an Enrollee is no longer eligible for FHPlus; or

                  iii)  an Enrollee is no longer the financial responsibility of
                        the LDSS; or

                  iv)   an Enrollee resides outside the Service Area covered by
                        this Agreement unless Contractor can demonstrate that
                        the Enrollee has made an informed choice to continue
                        enrollment with Contractor and that Enrollee will have
                        sufficient access to Contractor's provider network.

            described in Sections 9.2 and 9.7 of this Agreement, is entitled to
            receive FHPlus benefits from the Contractor's plan for a period of

      9.4   An Enrollee-initiated disenrollment from the Contractor's plan
            terminates the Guaranteed Eligibility period.

      9.5   An Enrollee who loses and regains FHPlus eligibility within a three
            (3) month period will not be entitled to a new period of six (6)
            months Guaranteed Eligibility.

      9.6   If a FHPlus Enrollee wishes to retain FHPlus eligibility during the

            without an income or resource spenddown and remains in the
            Contractor's plan, is not entitled to the six (6) month Guaranteed
            Eligibility Period because he or she has not lost benefits as a
            result of the change in coverage.

                  procedures for accessing services for Emergency Medical
                  Conditions and for accessing services for Urgent Medical

                  emergency, as stated in Appendix G. Nothing herein precludes
                  the Contractor from entering into contracts with providers or

                  notification to the Contractor after Enrollees present for
                  Emergency Services and are subsequently stabilized. Except as

                  Contractor and a Participating Provider, the Contractor must
                  pay for services for Emergency Medical Conditions whether

                  Provider, and may not deny payments if notification is not
                  timely.

                  receive Emergency Services from or through a Participating
                  Provider. The Contractor shall bear the cost of providing
                  Emergency Services through Non-Participating Providers.

            d)    The Contractor agrees to abide by guidelines for the provision
                  and payment of Emergency Care and Services which are specified
                  in Appendix G, which is hereby made a part of this Agreement
                  as if set forth fully herein.

      10.14 Coordination with Local Public Health Agencies

            The Contractor will coordinate its public health-related activities
            with Local Public Health Agencies. Coordination mechanisms and
            operational protocols for addressing public health issues will be
            negotiated with the Local Public Health and Social Services

      10.15 Public Health Services

            a)    Tuberculosis Screening Diagnosis and Treatment; Directly
                  Observed Therapy(TB\DOT):

                  i)    Consistent with New York State law, public health
                        clinics are required to provide or arrange for
                        treatment to individuals presenting with tuberculosis,
                        regardless of the person's insurance or enrollment
                        status. It is the State's preference that the
                        Contractor's Enrollees receive TB diagnosis and
                        treatment through the Contractor's plan, to the extent
                        that providers experienced in this type of care are
                        available in the Contractor's network of Participating
                        Providers although Enrollees may self-refer to public
                        health agency facilities for the diagnosis and/or
                        treatment of TB. The Contractor agrees to reimburse
                        public health clinics when physician visit and patient
                        management or laboratory and radiology services are
                        rendered to their Enrollees, within the context of TB
                        diagnosis and treatment.

                  ii)   The Contractor's Participating Providers must report TB
                        cases to the Local Public Health Agency. The SDOH will
                        have the Local Public Health Agency review the
                        tuberculosis treatment protocols and networks of
                        Participating Providers of the Contractor, to verify
                        their readiness to treat Tuberculosis patients. The
                        Contractor's protocols will be evaluated against State
                        and local guidelines. State and local departments of
                        health also will be available to offer technical
                        assistance to the Contractor in establishing TB policies
                        and procedures.

                  iii)  The Contractor may require the Local Public Health
                        Agency to give notification before delivering TB related
                        services, unless these services are ordered by a court
                        of competent jurisdiction. The Local Public Health
                        Agency will: 1) make reasonable efforts to

                               FHPlus - Section 10

<PAGE>

                        verify with the Enrollee's PCP that he/she has not
                        already provided TB care and treatment, and 2) provide
                        documentation of services rendered along with the claim.

                  iv)   The Contractor may use locally negotiated fees. In
                        addition, SDOH will establish fee schedules for these
                        services, which the Contractor may use in the absence of
                        locally negotiated fees.

                  v)    Contractors may require prior authorization for
                        non-emergency inpatient hospital admissions, except that
                        prior authorization will not be required for an
                        admission pursuant to a court order or an order of
                        detention issued by the local commissioner or director
                        of public health.

                  vi)   The Contractor shall provide the Local Public Health
                        Agency with access to health care practitioners on a
                        twenty-four (24) hour a day, seven (7) day a week basis
                        who can authorize inpatient hospital admissions. The
                        Contractor shall respond to the Local Public Health
                        Agency's request for authorization within the same day.

                  vii)  The Contractor will not be capitated or financially
                        liable for Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) cost. The
                        Contractor agrees to make all reasonable effort to
                        ensure coordination with DOT providers regarding
                        clinical care and services. The Contractor also will not
                        be financially liable for treatments rendered to
                        Enrollees who have been institutionalized as a result
                        of local health commissioner's order due to
                        non-compliance with TB care regimens.

                  viii) The Contractor remains responsible for communicating,
                        cooperating, and coordinating clinical management of TB
                        with the TB/DOT provider.

            b)    Immunizations

                  i)    Immunizations and administration of immunizations for
                        Enrollees will be included in the Benefit Package and
                        the Contractor will be required to reimburse the Local
                        Public Health Agency when Enrollees self-refer.

                  ii)   In order to be eligible for reimbursement, a Local
                        Public Health Agency must make reasonable efforts to (1)
                        determine the Enrollee's managed care membership status;
                        and (2) ascertain the Enrollee's immunization status.
                        Such efforts shall consist of client interviews and,
                        when available, access to the Immunization Registry.
                        When an Enrollee presents a membership card with a PCP's
                        name, the Local Public Health Agency shall call the PCP.
                        If the agency is unable to verify the immunization
                        status from the PCP or learns that immunization is
                        needed, the agency shall proceed to deliver the service
                        as appropriate, and the Contractor will reimburse the
                        Local Public Health Agency at the negotiated rate or at
                        a fee schedule to be used in the absence of a negotiated

            To adequately address the HIV prevention needs of uninfected
            Enrollees, as well as the special needs of individuals with HIV
            infection who do enroll in FHPlus, the Contractor shall have in
            place all of the following:

            a)    Methods for promoting HIV prevention to all Plan Enrollees.
                  HIV prevention information, both primary, as well as
                  secondary should be tailored to the Enrollee's age, sex, and
                  risk factor(s), (e.g., injection drug use and sexual risk
                  activities), and should be culturally and linguistically
                  appropriate HIV primary prevention means the reduction or
                  control of causative factors for HIV, including the reduction
                  of risk factors. HIV primary prevention includes strategies to
                  help prevent uninfected Enrollees from acquiring HIV, i.e.,
                  behavior counselling for HIV negative Enrollees with risk
                  behavior. Primary prevention also includes strategies to help
                  prevent infected Enrollees from transmitting HIV infection,
                  i.e., behavior counseling with an HIV infected Enrollee to
                  reduce risky sexual behavior or providing antiviral therapy to
                  a pregnant, HIV infected female to prevent the transmission of
                  HIV infection to a newborn. HIV Secondary Prevention means
                  promotion of early detection and treatment of HIV disease in
                  an asymptomatic Enrollee to prevent the development of
                  symptomatic disease. This includes: regular medical
                  assessments; routine immunization for preventable infections;
                  prophylaxis for opportunistic infections; regular dental,
                  optical, dermatological and gynecological care; optimal
                  diet/nutritional supplementation; and partner notification
                  services which lead to the early detection and treatment of
                  other infected persons. All plan Enrollees should be informed
                  of the availability of HIV counseling, testing, referral and
                  partner notification (CTRPN) services.

            b)    Policies and procedures promoting the early identification of
                  HIV infection in Enrollees. Such policies and procedures shall
                  include at a minimum: assessment methods for recognizing the
                  early signs and symptoms of HIV disease; initial and routine
                  screening for HIV risk factors through administration of
                  sexual behavior and drug and alcohol use assessments; and the
                  provision of information to all Enrollees regarding the
                  availability of in-plan HIV CTRNP services and anonymous CTRPN
                  services from New York State, New York City and Local Public
                  Health Agencies.

            c)    The Contractor shall comply with the requirements set forth in
                  Title 10 NYCRR (including Section 98-1.2 and in Subpart 69-I)
                  which mandate that HIV counseling with testing, presented as a
                  clinical recommendation, be provided to all women in prenatal
                  care and their newborns. Consistent with these requirements,
                  the Contractor shall ensure that Participating Providers refer
                  such Enrollees determined to have HIV infection for clinically
                  appropriate services.

                  The Contractor shall establish policies and procedures to
                  ensure that Enrollees who have been identified as having HIV
                  infection are assessed for case management services. The
                  Contractor shall arrange for any Enrollee Identified as having
                  HIV infection and needing case management services to be

                  psychosocial case management services.

            f)    Reporting. The Contractor shall require its Participating
                  Providers to report positive HIV test results and diagnoses
                  and known contacts of such persons to the New York State
                  Commissioner of Health. In New York City, these shall be

                  to partner notification services must be consistent with
                  10 NYCRR Part 63.

            g)    Updates and Dissemination of HIV Practice Guidelines. The
                  Contractor's Medical Director shall review Contractor's HIV
                  practice guidelines at least annually and update them as

                  potential Enrollees of the Contractor in any county of the
                  Service Area speak that particular language and do not speak
                  English as a first language.

            b)    In addition, verbal interpretation services must be made

                  practical, but otherwise may be offered by telephone.

            The SDOH will determine the need for other than English translations
            based on county-specific census data or other available measures.

      13.   ENROLLEE NOTIFICATION

            13.1  Provider Directories/Office Hours for Participating Providers

                  a)    The Contractor will provide to each Enrollee, and upon
                        request to each prospective Enrollee, a list of
                        Participating Providers by specialty and a list of
                        facilities for the county/borough in which the Enrollee
                        or prospective Enrollee resides. Such list shall include
                        names, office addresses, telephone numbers, board
                        certification for physicians, and information on
                        language capabilities and wheelchair accessibility of
                        Participating Providers. This information must be
                        provided in the form of a Provider Directory which must
                        be updated by the Contractor quarterly. Updates for
                        three consecutive quarters may be accomplished through
                        inserts which minimally include additions or deletions
                        of Participating Providers. An updated provider
                        directory must be provided in writing to the
                        Contractor's Enrollees at least annually. Provider
                        directories, including all relevant inserts, shall be
                        made available to new Enrollees, and to prospective
                        Enrollees, upon request.

                  b)    In addition, the Contractor must make available to the
                        SDOH/LDSS the office hours for Participating Providers.
                        This requirement may be satisfied by providing a copy of
                        the list or Provider Directory described in this Section
                        with the addition of office hours or by providing a
                        separate listing of office hours for Participating
                        Providers.

            13.2  Member ID Cards

                  a)    The Contractor must issue an identification card to the
                        Enrollee containing the following information:

                        i.    the name of the Enrollee's clinic (if applicable);

                        ii.   the name of the Enrollee's PCP and the PCP's
                              telephone number;

                        iii.  the member services toll free telephone number;
                              and

                        iv.   the twenty-four (24) hour toll free telephone
                              number that Enrollees may use to access
                              information on obtaining services when his/her PCP
                              is not available.

                  b)    If on Enrollee is being served by a PCP team, the name
                        of the individual shown on the card should be the lead
                        provider. PCP information may be embossed on the card or
                        affixed to the card by a sticker.

                  c)    The Contractor shall issue an identification card within
                        fourteen (14) days of an Enrollee's Effective Date of
                        Enrollment. If unforeseen circumstances, such as the
                        lack of identification of a PCP, prevent the MCO from
                        forwarding the official identification card to new
                        Enrollees within the fourteen (14) day period,
                        alternative measures by which Enrollees may identify
                        themselves such as use of a Welcome Letter or

                              FHPlus - Section 13

<PAGE>

                        a temporary identification card shall be deemed
                        acceptable until such time as a PCP is either chosen by
                        the Enrollee or auto assigned by the Contractor. The
                        Contractor agrees to implement an alternative method by
                        which individuals may identify themselves as Enrollees
                        prior to receiving the card (e.g., using a "welcome
                        letter" from the plan) and to update PCP information on
                        the identification card.

            13.3  Member Handbooks

                  The Contractor shall issue to a new Enrollee within fourteen
                  (14) days of the Effective Date of Enrollment a FHPlus Member
                  Handbook, which is consistent with the SDOH guidelines
                  described in Appendix E, a copy of which is amended hereto
                  and incorporated by reference into the body of this agreement
                  as if fully set forth herein.

            13.4  Notification of Effective Date of Enrollment

                  The Contractor shall inform each Enrollee in writing within
                  fourteen (14) days of the Effective Date of Enrollment of any
                  restriction on the Enrollee's right to terminate enrollment.
                  The initial enrollment information and the FHPlus Member
                  Handbook shall be adequate to convey this notice.

            13.5  Notification of Enrollee Rights

                  The Contractor agrees to make all reasonable efforts to
                  contact new Enrollees, in person, by telephone, or by mail,
                  within thirty (30) days of their Effective Date of Enrollment.
                  "Reasonable efforts" are defined to mean at least three (3)
                  attempts, with more than one method of contact being employed.
                  Upon contacting the new Enrollee(s), the Contractor agrees to
                  do at least the following:

                  a)    Inform the Enrollee about the Contractor's policies with
                        respect to obtaining medical services, including
                        Specialty Services and services for which the Enrollee
                        may self-refer, and what to do in an emergency.

                  b)    Conduct a brief health screening to assess the
                        Enrollee's need for any special health care (e.g.,
                        prenatal or behavioral health services) or
                        language/communication needs. If a special need is
                        identified, the Contractor shall assist the Enrollee in
                        arranging for an appointment with his/her PCP or other
                        appropriate provider.

                  c)    Offer assistance in arranging an initial visit to the
                        Enrollee's PCP for a baseline physical and other
                        preventive services,

                        including an assessment of the Enrollee's potential
                        risk, if any, for specific diseases or conditions.

                  d)    Inform new Enrollees about their rights for continuation
                        of certain existing services.

                  e)    Provide the Enrollee with the Contractor's toll free
                        telephone number that may be called twenty-four (24)
                        hours a day, seven (7) days a week if the Enrollee has
                        questions about obtaining services and cannot reach
                        his/her PCP (this telephone number need not be the
                        Member Services line and need not be staffed to respond
                        to Member Services-related inquiries). The Contractor
                        must have appropriate mechanisms in place to accommodate
                        Enrollees who do not have telephones and therefore
                        cannot readily receive a call back.

                  f)    Advise Enrollee about opportunities available to learn
                        about MCO policies and benefits in greater detail (e.g.,
                        welcome meeting, Enrollee orientation and education
                        sessions).

                  g)    Provide the Enrollee with a complete list of network
                        providers that may be accessed directly, without
                        referral. The list should group providers by service
                        type and must include addresses and telephone numbers.

                  h)    Assist the Enrollee in selecting a primary care provider
                        if the Enrollee has not already chosen a PCP.

      13.6  Enrollee's Rights to Advance Directives

            The Contractor shall, in compliance with the requirements of 42 CFR
            Section 434.28, maintain written policies and procedures regarding
            advance directives and inform each Enrollee in writing at the time
            of enrollment of an individual's rights under State law to formulate
            advance directives and of the Contractor's policies regarding the
            implementation of such rights. The Contractor shall include in such
            written notice to the Enrollee materials relating to advance
            directives and health care proxies as specified in 10 NYCRR Sections
            98.14(f) and 700.5.

      13.7  Approval of Written Notices

            The Contractor shall submit the format and content of all written
            notifications described in this Section for review and prior
            approval to the SDOH and/or LDSS. All written notifications must be
            written at a fourth (4th) to sixth (6th) grade level and in at least
            ten (10) point print.

      13.8  Contractor's Duty to Report Lack of Contact

            The Contractor must inform the LDSS of any Enrollee whom it has been
            unable to contact within ninety (90) days of enrollment using
            reasonable efforts as defined in Section 13.5 of the Agreement and
            who has not presented for any health care services through the
            Contractor or its Participating Providers.

      13.9  Contractor Responsibility to Notify Enrollee of Expected Effective
            Date of Enrollment

            The Contractor must notify the Enrollee of the expected Effective
            Date of Enrollment. In the event that the actual Effective Date of
            Enrollment is different from that given to the Enrollee, the
            Contractor must notify the Enrollee of the actual date of
            enrollment. This may be accomplished through a Welcome Letter. To
            the extent practicable, such notification must precede the Effective
            Date of Enrollment.

      13.10 LDSS Notification of Enrollee's Change in Address

            SDOH will require LDSS to notify the Contractor of any known change
            in address of Enrollees in the Contractor's plan.

      13.11 Contractor Responsibility to Notify Enrollee of Effective Date of
            Benefit Package Change

            The Contractor must provide written notification of the effective
            date of any Contractor-initiated, SDOH approved benefit package
            change to Enrollees in the Contractor's plan. Notification to
            Enrollees must be provided at least 30 days in advance of the
            effective date of such change.

      13.12 Contractor Responsibility to Notify Enrollee of Termination, Service
            Area Changes and Network Changes

            With prior notice to and approval of the SDOH and LDSS, the
            Contractor shall inform each Enrollee in writing of any withdrawal
            by the Contractor from the Family Health Plus program pursuant to
            Section 2.7, withdrawal from the service area encompassing the
            Enrollee's zip code, and/or significant changes to the Contractor's
            provider network pursuant to Section 21.1 d), except that the
            Contractor need not notify Enrollees who will not be affected by
            such changes.

            The Contractor shall provide the notifications within the timeframes
            specified by SDOH and/or LDSS, and shall obtain the prior approval
            of the notification from SDOH and/or LDSS.

      14.2  Notification of Complaint and Appeal Program

                  a)    The Contractor's specific complaint and appeal program

            The Contractor shall pay liquidated damages of $2,500 if any report
            required pursuant to this Section is materially incomplete, contains
            material misstatements or inaccurate information, or is not
            submitted on time in the requested format. The Contractor shall pay
            liquidated damages of $2,500 to the SDOH if its monthly encounter
            data submission is not received by the Fiscal Agent by the due date

            Contractor fails to cure the first infraction within a reasonable
            period of time upon notice from the SDOH. Liquidated damages may be
            waived at the sole discretion of SDOH. Nothing in this Section shall

            the request to the other agency, where the Contractor has
            demonstrated a good and compelling reason for the extension or
            modification. The determination to grant a modification or extension
            of time shall be made by SDOH.

21.   PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS

      21.1  Network Requirements

            a)    Sufficient Number

                  i)    The Contractor will establish and maintain a network of
                        Participating Providers.

                  ii)   The Contractor's network must contain all of the
                        provider types necessary to furnish the FHPlus prepaid
                        Benefit Package as defined in Appendix K, a copy of
                        which is amended hereto and incorporated by reference
                        herein as if fully set forth in the body of this
                        Agreement, including but not limited to: hospitals,
                        physicians (primary care and specialists), mental health
                        and substance abuse providers, allied  health
                        professionals, ancillary providers, DME providers and
                        home health providers.

                  iii)  To be considered accessible, the network must contain a
                        sufficient number and array of providers to meet the
                        diverse needs of the Enrollee population. This includes
                        being geographically accessible (meeting time/distance
                        standards) and being accessible for the disabled.

                  iv)   The Contractor shall not include in its network any
                        provider who has been sanctioned or prohibited from
                        serving Medicaid recipients or receiving Medical
                        Assistance payments.

            b)    Absence of Appropriate Network Provider

                  In the event that the Contractor determines that it does not
                  have a Participating Provider with appropriate training and
                  experience to meet the particular health care needs of an
                  Enrollee, the Contractor shall make a referral to an
                  appropriate Non-Participating Provider pursuant to a treatment
                  plan approved by the Contractor in consultation with the
                  Primary Care Provider, the Non-Participating Provider and the
                  Enrollee or the Enrollee's designee. The Contractor shall pay
                  for the cost of the services in the treatment plan provided by
                  the Non-Participating Provider.

            c)    Suspension of Enrollee Assignments To Providers

                  The Contractor shall ensure that there is sufficient capacity,
                  consistent with SDOH standards, to serve Enrollees under this
                  Agreement. In the event any of the Contractor's Participating
                  Providers are no longer able to

                               FHPlus - Section 21

<PAGE>

                  accept assignment of new Enrollees due to capacity
                  limitations, as determined by the SDOH, the Contractor will
                  suspend assignment of any additional Enrollees to such
                  Participating Provider until it is capable of further
                  accepting Enrollees. When a Participating Provider has more
                  than one (1) site, the suspension will be made by site.

            d)    Notice of Provider Termination

                  The Contractor shall immediately notify SDOH of any notice of
                  termination of a provider agreement to the Contractor's
                  provider network received from the following providers

                        i)    Hospital

                        ii)   IPA

                        iii)  Medical Group

                  The Contractor shall also notify SDOH in the event that the
                  Contractor and the providers have failed to re-execute a
                  renewal provider agreement forty-five (45) days prior to the
                  expiration of the agreement.

                  The Contractor shall submit a contingency plan to SDOH, at
                  least forty-five (45) days prior to the termination or
                  expiration of the agreement, identifying the number of
                  Enrollees affected by the potential withdrawal, if applicable,
                  and specifying how services previously furnished by the
                  participating providers will be provided in the event of their
                  withdrawal. If the provider is a participating hospital, the
                  Contractor shall identify the number of providers who  would
                  not have admitting privileges in the absence of such
                  participating hospital.

                  The Contractor shall develop a transition plan for patients of
                  the departing providers subject to approval by SDOH. SDOH may
                  direct the Contractor to provide notice to the patients of
                  PCPs or specialists including available options for the
                  patients, and availability of continuing care, consistent with
                  Section 13.7, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
                  termination of the provider agreement. In the event that
                  provider agreements are terminated with less than the notice
                  period required by this section, the Contractor shall
                  immediately notify SDOH, and develop a transition plan on an
                  expedited basis and provide notice to patients subject to the
                  consent of SDOH.

                  Upon Contractor notice of failure to re-execute, or
                  termination of, a provider agreement, the SDOH may waive the
                  requirement of submission of a contingency plan upon a
                  determination by the SDOH that:

                        i)    the impact upon Enrollees is not significant,
                              and/or

                        ii)   the Contractor and provider are continuing to
                              negotiate in good faith and consent to extend the
                              provider agreement for a period

                              of time necessary to provide not less than thirty
                              (30) days notice to Enrollees.

            SDOH reserves the right to take any other actions permitted by this
            Agreement and under regulatory or statutory authority, including but
            not limited to contract termination.

      21.2  Credentialing

            a)    Licensure

                  The Contractor shall ensure, in accordance with Article 44 of
                  the Public Health Law, that persons and entities providing
                  care and services for the Contractor in the capacity of
                  physician, dentist, physician's assistant, registered nurse,
                  other medical professional or paraprofessional, or other such
                  person or entity satisfy all applicable licensing,
                  certification, or qualification requirements under New York
                  law and that the functions and responsibilities of such
                  persons and entities in providing Benefit Package services
                  under this Agreement do not exceed those permissible under New
                  York law.

            b)    Minimum Standards

                  The Contractor agrees that all network physicians will meet at
                  least one (1) of the following standards, except as specified
                  in Section 21.13(b) and Appendix I of this agreement:

                  i) Be board-certified or -eligible in their area of specialty;

                  ii) Have completed an accredited residency program; or

                  iii) Have admitting privileges at one (1) or more hospitals
                       participating in the Contractor's network.

            c)    Credentialing/Recredentialing Process

                  The Contractor shall have in place a formal process for
                  credentialing Participating Providers on a periodic basis (not
                  less than once every three (3) years) and for monitoring
                  Participating Providers performance.

            d)    Application Procedure

                  The Contractor shall establish a written application procedure
                  to be used by a health care professional interested in serving
                  as a Participating Provider with the Contractor. The criteria
                  for selecting providers, including the minimum qualification
                  requirements that a health care professional must meet to be
                  considered by the Contractor, must be defined in writing and
                  developed in consultation

                               FHPlus - Section 21
                            (PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS)

                  with appropriately qualified health care professionals. Upon
                  request, the application procedures and minimum qualification
                  requirements must be made available to health care
                  professionals.

      21.3  SDOH Exclusion or Termination of Providers

            If SDOH excludes or terminates a provider from its Medicaid Program,
            the Contractor shall, upon learning of such exclusion or
            termination, immediately terminate the provider agreement with the
            Participating Provider as it pertains to the Contractor's FHPlus
            program, and agrees to no longer utilize the services of the subject
            provider, as applicable. The Contractor will receive a listing of
            currently excluded Medicaid providers mailed monthly to the
            correspondence address, that the Contractor specified to SDOH during
            the initial provider enrollment process. Such listing shall be
            deemed to constitute constructive notice. This notification should
            not be the sole basis for identifying current exclusions or
            termination of previously approved providers. Should the Contractor
            become aware, through any source, of an SDOH exclusion or
            termination, the Contractor shall validate this information with the
            Office of Medicaid Management, Bureau of Enforcement Activities and
            comply with the provisions of this Section.

      21.4  Evaluation Information

            The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures
            to ensure that health care professionals are regularly advised of
            information maintained by the Contractor to evaluate the performance
            or practice of health care professionals. The Contractor shall
            consult with health care professionals in developing methodologies
            to collect and analyze health care professional profiling data. The
            Contractor shall provide any such information and profiling data and
            analysis to health care professionals. Such information, data or
            analysis shall be provided on a periodic basis appropriate to the
            nature and amount of data and the volume and scope of services
            provided. Any profiling data used to evaluate the performance or
            practice of a health care professional shall be measured against
            stated criteria and an appropriate group of health care
            professionals using similar treatment modalities serving a
            comparable patient population. Upon presentation of such information
            or data, each health care professional shall be given the
            opportunity to discuss the unique nature of the health care
            professional's patient population which may have a bearing on the
            health care professional's profile and to work cooperatively with

                  made reasonable efforts as set forth in Section 13.5 of this
                  Agreement to contact the Enrollee and inform him/her of

                  the Enrollee must choose or be assigned a specific provider or
                  provider team within the clinic to serve as his/her PCP. This

                  thirty (30) days, the PCP may be changed once every six (6)
                  months without cause.

            b)    The Contractor must process a request to change PCPs and
                  advise the Enrollee of the effective date of the change within

                  must be effective no later than the first (1st) day of the
                  second (2nd) month following the month in which the request is

                  changes shall not be considered in the calculation of changes
                  for cause allowed within a six (6) month period.

            d)    In the event that an assignment of a new PCP is necessary due
                  to the unavailability of the Enrollee's former PCP, such
                  assignment shall be made in accordance with the requirements
                  of Section 21.6 of this Agreement.

            e)    In addition to those conditions and circumstances under which
                  the Contractor may assign a PCP to an Enrollee when the
                  Enrollee fails to make an affirmative choice of a PCP, the
                  Contractor may initiate a PCP change for an Enrollee under the
                  following circumstances:

                  i)    The Enrollee requires specialized care for an acute or
                        chronic condition and the Enrollee and Contractor agree
                        that reassignment to a different PCP is in the
                        Enrollee's interest.

                  ii)   The Enrollee's place of residence has changed and as a

                  iii)  The Enrollee's PCP ceases to participate in the
                        Contractor's network.

                  iv)   The Enrollee's behavior toward the PCP is disruptive and
                        the PCP has made all reasonable efforts to accommodate
                        the Enrollee.

                  v)    The Enrollee has taken legal action against the PCP.

            f)    Prior to initiating a change, the Contractor must offer
                  affected Enrollees the opportunity to select a new PCP in the
                  manner described in this Section.

22.   SUBCONTRACTS AND PROVIDER AGREEMENTS

      22.1  Written Subcontracts

            Contractor may not enter into any subcontracts related to the
            delivery of services to Enrollees, except by a written agreement.

            If the Contractor enters into subcontracts for the performance of
            work pursuant to this Agreement the Contractor shall take full
            responsibility for the acts or omissions of its subcontractors.
            Nothing in the subcontract shall impair the rights of the State
            under this Agreement. No contractual relationship shall be deemed to
            exist between the subcontractor and the State.

            The Contractor agrees not to enter into any agreements, with third
            party organizations for the performance of its obligations, in whole
            or in part, under this Agreement without the State's prior written
            approval of such third parties and the scope of the work to be
            performed by them. The State's approval of the scope of work and the
            subcontractor does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to
            perform fully under this Agreement. The responsibilities of the
            Contractor and any subcontractors will be limited to those specified
            in the subcontracts.

      22.2  Permissible Subcontracts

            Contractor may subcontract for provider services as set forth in
            Sections 2.6 and 21 of this contract and management services
            including, but not limited to, marketing, quality assurance and
            utilization review activities and such other services only as are
            acceptable to the SDOH.

            All subcontracts, including provider agreements, entered into by the
            Contractor to provide program services for Family Health Plus under
            this Agreement shall contain the provisions specifying:

                  a.    That the work performed by the subcontractor must be in
                        accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

                  b.    That nothing contained in such agreement shall impair
                        the rights of the State; and

                  c.    That the subcontractor specifically agrees to be bound
                        by the confidentiality provisions set forth in the
                        Agreement between the State and the Contractor.

            Participating Providers.

      22.4  Approvals

            a)    Provider Agreements and any material amendments thereto shall

                  10 NYCRR Part 98.

            b)    If a subcontract is for management services under 10 NYCRR

                  approved by SDOH before they may be implemented.

      22.5  Required Components

            a)    The Contractor shall impose obligations and duties on its
                  subcontractors, including its Participating Providers, that
                  are consistent with this Agreement, and that do not impair any
                  rights accorded to DHHS, SDOH, or the LDSS.

            b)    No subcontract, including any Provider Agreement shall limit
                  or terminate the Contractor's duties and obligations under
                  this Agreement.

            c)    Nothing contained in this Agreement between SDOH and the
                  Contractor shall create any contractual relationship between
                  any subcontractor of the Contractor, including Participating
                  Providers, and SDOH.

            d)    Any subcontract entered into by the Contractor shall fulfill
                  the requirements of 42 OFR Part 434 that are appropriate to
                  the service or activity delegated under such subcontract.

            e)    The Contractor shall also ensure that, in the event the
                  Contractor fails to pay any subcontractor, including any
                  Participating Provider

                               FHPlus - Section 22

                  subcontractor or Participating Provider will not seek payment
                  from the LDSS, SDOH, the Enrollees, their eligible dependents,
                  or anyone authorized to act on an Enrollee's behalf.

            f)    The Contractor shall include in every Provider Agreement a
                  procedure for the resolution of disputes between the
                  Contractor and its Participating Providers.

      22.6  Timely Payment

            Contractor shall make payments to affiliated health care providers
            for items and services covered under this Agreement on a timely
            basis, consistent with the claims payment procedures described in
            Insurance Law Section 3224-a.

      22.7  Restrictions on Disclosure

            The Contractor shall not by contract or by written policy or
            procedure prohibit or restrict any health care provider from the

            a)    Disclosing to any subscriber, Enrollee, patient, designated
                  representative or, where appropriate, prospective Enrollee any
                  information that such provider deems appropriate regarding:

                        i)    a condition or a course of treatment with such
                              subscriber, Enrollee, patient designated

                        ii)   The provisions, terms, or requirements of the
                              Contractor's products as they relate to the
                              Enrollee, where applicable.

            b)    Filing a complaint, making a report or comment to an
                  appropriate governmental body regarding the policies or
                  practices of the Contractor when they believe that the
                  policies or practices negatively impact upon the quality of,
                  or access to, patient care.

            c)    Advocating to the Contractor on behalf of the Enrollee for

                  provision of health care services.

      22.8  Transfer of Liability

            No contract or agreement between the Contractor and a health care
            provider shall contain any cause purporting to transfer to the
            health care provider, other than a medical group, by indemnification
            or otherwise, any

                               FHPlus - Section 22
                     (SUBCONTRACTS AND PROVIDER AGREEMENTS)

            liability relating to activities, actions or omissions of the
            Contractor as opposed to those of the health care provider.

      22.9  Termination of Health Care Professional Agreements

            The Contractor shall not terminate a contract with a health care
            professional unless the Contractor provides to the health care
            professional a written explanation of the reasons for the proposed
            termination and an opportunity for a review or hearing as
            hereinafter provided. For purposes of this Section a health care
            professional is an individual licensed, registered or certified
            pursuant to Title 8 of the Education Law.

            These requirements shall not apply in cases involving imminent harm
            to patient care, a determination of fraud, or a final disciplinary
            action by a state licensing board or other governmental agency that
            impairs the health care professional's ability to practice.

            When the Contractor desires to terminate a contract with a health
            care professional, the notification of the proposed termination by
            the Contractor to the health care professional shall include:

            a)    the reasons for the proposed action;

            b)    notice that the health care professional has the right to
                  request a hearing or review, at the provider's discretion,
                  before a panel appointed by the Contractor;

            c)    a time limit of not less than thirty (30) days within which a
                  health care professional may request a hearing; and

            d)    a time limit for a hearing date which must be held within
                  thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a request for a
                  hearing.

            No contract or agreement between the Contractor and a health care
            professional shall contain any provision which shall supersede or
            impair a health care professional's right to notice of reasons for
            termination and the opportunity for a hearing or review concerning
            such termination.

      22.10 Health Care Professional Hearings

            A health care professional that has been notified of his or her
            proposed termination must be allowed a hearing. The procedures for
            this hearing must meet the following standards:

            a)    The hearing panel shall be comprised of at least three persons
                  appointed by the Contractor. At least one person on such panel
                  shall

<PAGE>

                  be a clinical peer in the same discipline and the same or
                  similar specialty as the health care professional under
                  review. The hearing panel may consist of more than three
                  persons, provided however that the number of clinical peers on
                  such panel shall constitute one-third or more of the total
                  membership of the panel.

            b)    The hearing panel shall render a decision on the proposed
                  action in a timely manner. Such decision shall include
                  reinstatement of the health care professional by the
                  Contractor, provisional reinstatement subject to conditions
                  set forth by the Contractor or termination of the health care
                  professional. Such decision shall be provided in writing to
                  the health care professional.

            c)    A decision by the hearing panel to terminate a health care
                  professional shall be effective not less than thirty (30) days
                  after the receipt by the health care professional of the
                  hearing panel's decision. Notwithstanding the termination of a
                  health care professional for cause or pursuant to a hearing, a
                  plan shall permit an Enrollee to continue an on-going course
                  of treatment for a transition period of up to ninety (90)
                  days, and post-partum care, subject to provider agreement,
                  pursuant to P.H.L Section 4406(6)(e).

            d)    In no event shall termination be effective earlier than sixty
                  (60) days from the receipt of the notice of termination.

      22.11 Non-Renewal of Provider Agreements

            Either party to a contract may exercise a right of non-renewal at
            the expiration of the contract period set forth therein or, for a
            contract without a specific expiration date, on each January first
            occurring after the contract has been in effect for at least one
            year, upon sixty (60) days notice to the other party; provided,
            however, that any non-renewal shall not constitute a termination for
            the purposes of this Section.

      22.12 Physician Incentive Plan

            If Contractor elects to operate a Physician Incentive Plan,
            Contractor agrees that no specific payment will be made directly or
            indirectly under the plan to a physician or physician group as an
            inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished
            to an Enrollee. Contractor agrees to submit to SDOH annual reports
            containing the information on its physician incentive plan in
            accordance with 42 CFR Section 434.70. The contents of such reports
            shall comply with the requirements of 42 CFR Section 417.479 and be
            in a format to be provided by SDOH.

<PAGE>

            The Contractor must ensure that any agreements for contracted
            services covered by this Agreement, such as agreements between the
            Contractor and other entities or between the Contractor's
            subcontracted entities and their contractors, at all levels
            including the physician level, include language requiring that the
            physician incentive plan information be provided by the
            sub-contractor in an accurate and timely manner to the Contractor,
            in the format requested by SDOH.

            In the event that the incentive arrangements place the physician or
            physician group at risk for services beyond those provided directly
            by the physician or physician group for an amount beyond the risk
            threshold of 25% of potential payments for covered services
            (substantial financial risk), the Contractor must comply with all
            additional requirements listed in regulation, such as: conduct
            enrollee/disenrollee satisfaction surveys; disclose the requirements
            for the physician incentive plans to its beneficiaries upon request;
            and ensure that all physicians and physician groups at substantial
            financial risk have adequate stop-loss protection. Any of these
            additional requirements that are passed on to the subcontractors
            must be clearly stated in the agreement between the Contractor and
            each subcontractor.

23.   FRAUD AND ABUSE PREVENTION PLAN

      A Fraud and Abuse Prevention Plan for the detection, investigation and
      prevention of fraudulent activities must be filed by the Contractor with
      the Commissioner of Health to the extent required by SDOH regulations.

24.   AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT COMPLIANCE PLAN

      Contractor must comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities
      Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for program
      accessibility, and must develop an ADA Compliance Plan consistent with the
      guidelines in Appendix J of this Agreement a copy of which is amended
      hereto and incorporated into the body of the Agreement as if fully set
      forth herein. Said plan must be approved by the SDOH and be filed with the
      Commissioner of Health and be kept on file by the Contractor.

25.   FAIR HEARINGS

      25.1  Enrollee Access To Fair Hearing Process

            Enrollees may access the fair hearing process in accordance with
            applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Contractors must
            abide by and participate in New York State's Fair Hearing Process
            and comply with determinations made by a fair hearing officer.

      25.2  Enrollee Rights to a Fair Hearing

            Enrollees may request a fair hearing regarding adverse LDSS
            determinations concerning enrollment, disenrollment and eligibility,
            and regarding the denial, termination, suspension or reduction of a
            clinical treatment or other Benefit Package services by the
            Contractor. For issues related to disputed services, Enrollees must
            have received an adverse determination from the Contractor or its
            approved utilization review agent either overriding a recommendation
            to provide services by a Participating Provider or confirming the
            decision of a Participating Provider to deny those services. An
            Enrollee may also seek a fair hearing for a failure by the
            Contractor to act with reasonable promptness with respect to such
            services. Reasonable promptness shall mean compliance with the time
            frames established for review of grievances and utilization review
            in Sections 44 and 49 of the Public Health Law for Article 44 plans
            or Articles 48 and 49 of the State Insurance Law for Article 43
            plans.

                  Determination and Fair Hearing Rights to any Enrollee:

                        denied a request to approve a Benefit Package service
                        ordered by an MCO provider; or

                  ii)   When an Enrollee is denied a requested service or
                        benefit by an MCO provider and has exhausted the
                        Contractor's approved internal complaint and appeal
                        procedures or utilization review processes; or

                  iii)  At least ten (10) days before the effective date of
                        Contractor's termination, suspension or reduction of a

                        Enrollee.

            b)    Contractor agrees to serve notice on affected Enrollees by
                  mail and must maintain documentation of such.

            c)    Contractor's Notice of Adverse Determination and Notice of a
                  Right to Request a Fair Hearing shall include the following:

                  i)    A description of the action Contractor intends to take;

                  ii)   Contractor's reasons for the intended action;

                  iii)  The circumstances under which expedited complaint or
                        utilization review is available and how to request it;

                  iv)   Notice of Enrollee's right to file a complaint with the
                        Contractor, a complaint with SDOH, and/or request a
                        State fair hearing through the Office of Administrative
                        Hearings (OAH);

                  v)    Instructions to the Enrollee regarding how the Enrollee
                        may file complaints, utilization appeals and State fair
                        hearing requests, including use of the Notice of Right
                        to Request a Fair Hearing which will inform Enrollees of
                        his or her possible right to aid continuing and that
                        such aid can be accessed only if the Enrollee requests a
                        State fair hearing.

      25.4  Aid Continuing

            Contractor shall be required to continue the provision of the
            Benefit Package services that are the subject of the fair hearing to
            an Enrollee (hereafter referred to as "aid continuing") if so
            ordered by the OAH under the following circumstances:

                  i)    Contractor has or is seeking to reduce, suspend or
                        terminate a treatment or Benefit Package service
                        currently being provided;

                  ii)   Enrollee has filed a timely request for a fair hearing
                        with OAH; and

                  iii)  There is a valid order for the treatment or service from
                        a participating provider. Contractor shall provide aid
                        continuing until the matter has been resolved to the
                        Enrollee's satisfaction or until the administrative
                        process has been completed and there is a

                        FHPlus - Section 23 -- Section 37
                                 October 1, 2001
                                  Page 2 of 11

<PAGE>

                  determination from OAH that Enrollee is not entitled to
                  receive the service, the Enrollee withdraws the request for
                  aid continuing and/or the fair hearing in writing, or the
                  treatment or service originally ordered by the provider has
                  been completed, whichever occurs first.

              iv) If the services and/or benefits in dispute have been
                  terminated, suspended or reduced and the Enrollee timely
                  requests a fair hearing, Contractor shall, at the direction of
                  either SDOH or LDSS, restore the disputed Services and/or
                  benefits consistent with the provisions of Section 25.4(iii)
                  of this Agreement.

      25.5  Responsibilities of SDOH

            SDOH will make every reasonable effort to ensure that the Contractor
            receives timely notice in writing by fax or e-mail, of all requests,
            schedules and directives regarding fair hearings.

      25.6  Contractor's Obligations

            a)    Contractor shall appear at all scheduled fair hearings
                  concerning its clinical determinations and/or
                  Contractor-initiated disenrollments to present evidence as
                  justification or submit written evidence as justification for
                  its determination regarding the disputed benefits and/or
                  services. If Contractor will not be making a personal
                  appearance at the fair hearing, the written material must be
                  submitted to OAH and Enrollee or Enrollee's representative at
                  least three (3) business days prior to the scheduled hearing.
                  If the hearing is scheduled fewer than three (3) business days
                  after the request, Contractor must deliver the evidence to the
                  hearing site no later than one (1) business day prior to the
                  hearing, otherwise Contractor must appear in person.
                  Notwithstanding the above provisions, Contractor may be
                  required to make a personal appearance at the discretion of
                  the hearing officer and/or SDOH.

            b)    Although an Enrollee may request a State fair hearing in any
                  given dispute, Contractor is required to maintain and operate
                  in good faith its own internal complaint and appeal process as
                  required under state and federal laws and by Section 14 and
                  Appendix F of this Agreement. Enrollees may seek redress of
                  adverse disenrollment determinations simultaneously through
                  Contractor's internal process and the State fair hearing
                  process. If Contractor has reversed its initial determination
                  and provided the service to the Enrollee, Contractor may
                  request a waiver from appearing at the hearing and, in
                  submitted papers, explain that it has withdrawn Its initial
                  determination and is providing the service or treatment
                  formerly in dispute.

<PAGE>

            c)    Contractor shall comply with all determinations rendered by
                  OAH at fair hearings. Contractor shall cooperate with SDOH
                  efforts to ensure that Contractor is in compliance with fair
                  hearing determinations. Failure by Contractor to maintain such
                  compliance shall constitute breach of this Agreement. Nothing
                  in this Section shall limit the remedies available to SDOH,
                  LDSS or the federal government relating to any non-compliance
                  by Contractor with a fair hearing determination or
                  Contractor's refusal to provide disputed services.

            d)    If SDOH investigates a complaint that has as its basis the
                  same dispute that is the subject of a pending fair hearing
                  and, as a result of its investigation, concludes that the
                  disputed services and/or benefits should be provided to the
                  Enrollee, Contractor shall comply with SDOH's directive to
                  provide those services and/or benefits and provide notice to
                  OAH and Enrollee as required by Section 25.6(b) of this
                  Agreement.

            e)    If SDOH, through its complaint investigation process, or OAH,
                  by a determination after a fair hearing, directs Contractor to
                  provide a service that was initially denied by Contractor,
                  Contractor may either directly provide the service, arrange
                  for the provision of that service or pay for the provision of
                  that service by a Non-Participating Provider.

            f)    Contractor agrees to abide by changes made to this Section of
                  the Agreement with respect to the fair hearing, grievance and
                  complaint processes by SDOH in order to comply with any
                  amendments to applicable state or federal statutes or
                  regulations or requirements imposed by DHHS. Such changes
                  shall become effective without need for any further action by
                  the parties to this Agreement.

            g)    Contractor agrees to identify a contact person within its
                  organization who will serve as a liaison to SDOH for the
                  purpose of receiving fair hearing requests, scheduled fair
                  hearing dates and adjourned fair hearing dates and compliance
                  with State directives. Such individual: shall be accessible to
                  the State by e-mail; shall monitor e-mail for correspondence
                  from the State at least once every business day; and shall
                  agree, on behalf of Contractor, to accept notices to
                  Contractor transmitted via e-mail as legally valid.

            h)    The information describing fair hearing rights, aid
                  continuing, complaint procedures and utilization review
                  appeals shall be included in all FHPlus managed care member
                  handbooks and shall comply with SDOH's member handbook
                  guidelines.

            i)    Contractor shall bear the burden of proof at hearings
                  regarding the reduction, suspension or termination of ongoing
                  benefits. In the event

                        FHPlus - Section 23 -- Section 37
                                 October 1, 2001
                                  Page 4 of 11

<PAGE>

                  that Contractor's initial adverse determination is upheld as a
                  result of a fair hearing, any aid continuing provided pursuant
                  to that hearing request, may be recouped by Contractor.

26.   EXTERNAL APPEAL

      26.1  Basis for External Appeal

            FHPlus Enrollees are eligible to request an external appeal when one
            or more covered health care services have been denied by the
            Contractor on the basis that the service(s) is not medically
            necessary or is experimental or investigational.

      26.2  Eligibility for External Appeal

            An Enrollee is eligible for an external appeal when the Enrollee has
            exhausted the Contractor's internal utilization review procedure or
            both the Enrollee and the Contractor have agreed to waive internal
            appeal procedures in accordance with New York State P.H.L. Section
            4914(2)2(a). A provider is also eligible for an external appeal of
            retrospective denials.

      26.3  External Appeal Determination

            The external appeal determination is binding on the Contractor,
            however, a fair hearing determination supercedes an external appeal
            determination for FHPlus Enrollees.

      26.4  Compliance with External Appeal Laws and Regulations

            MCOs must comply with the provisions of New York State P.H.L.
            Sections 4910-4914 and Title 10 of NYCRR Subpart 98-2 and
            Article 49 of the Insurance law regarding the external appeal
            program.

27.   INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS

      Contractor is subject to the imposition of sanctions as authorized by
      State law including the SDOH's right to impose sanctions for unacceptable
      practices as set forth in Title 18 of the Official Compilation of Codes,
      Rules and Regulations of the State of New York (NYCRR) Part 515 and civil
      and monetary penalties pursuant to 18 NYCRR Part 516 and such other
      sanctions and penalties as are authorized by local laws and ordinances and
      resultant administrative codes, rules and regulations related to the
      Medical Assistance Program or to the delivery of the contracted for
      services.

      Section 1857(h), Section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section
      1368), Executive Order 11738, and the Environmental Protection Agency
      ("EPA") regulations (40 CFR, Part 15) that prohibit the use of the
      facilities included on the EPA List of Violating Facilities. The
      Contractor shall report violations to SDOH and to the Assistant
      Administrator for Enforcement of the EPA.

29.   ENERGY CONSERVATION

      The Contractor shall comply with any applicable mandatory standards and
      policies relating to energy efficiency that are contained in the State
      Energy Conservation regulation issued in compliance with the Energy Policy
      and Conservation Act of 1975 (Pub. L 94-165) and any amendment to the Act.

30.   INDEPENDENT CAPACITY OF CONTRACTOR

      The parties agree that the Contractor is an independent Contractor, and
      that the Contractor, its agents, officers, and employees act in an
      independent capacity and not as officers or employees of LDSS, DHHS or the
      SDOH.

31.   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES

      Only the parties to this Agreement and their successors in interest and
      assigns have any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

32.   INDEMNIFICATION

      32.1  Indemnification by Contractor

            The Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the LDSS

                              and the Contractor, at its sole option, shall
                              defend or settle said claim. The SDOH shall
                              cooperate with the Contractor to the extent
                              necessary for the Contractor to discharge its
                              obligation under Section 32.1.

                        ii)   The Contractor shall have no obligation under this
                              section with respect to any claim or cause of
                              action for damages to persons or property solely
                              caused by the negligence of SDOH, its employees,
                              or agents.

      32.2  Indemnification by SDOH

            The SDOH agrees to indemnify and hold the Contractor harmless, to
            the extent authorized by Article 3, Section 19 of the New York State

The parties to the attached contract, license, lease, amendment or other
agreement of any kind (hereinafter, "the contract" or "this contract") agree to
be bound by the following clauses which are hereby made a part of the contract
(the word "Contractor" herein refers to any party other than the State, whether
a contractor, licenser, licensee, lessor, lessee or any other party):

1.    EXECUTORY CLAUSE. In accordance with Section 41 of the State Finance Law,

      State and any attempts to assign the contract without the State's written
      consent are null and void. The Contractor may, however, assign its right
      to receive payment without the State's prior written consent unless this
      contract concerns Certificates of Participation pursuant to Article 5-A of
      the State Finance Law.

3.    COMPTROLLER'S APPROVAL. In accordance with Section 112 of the State

4.    WORKERS' COMPENSATION BENEFITS. In accordance with Section 142 of the
      State Finance Law, this contract shall be void and of no force and effect

      with any State department or agency, including any contract for a term
      commencing prior to the term of this contract, plus any amounts due and
      owing to the State for any other reason including, without limitation, tax
      delinquencies, fee delinquencies or monetary penalties relative thereto.

      involved in this contract, shall have access to the Records during normal

      or, if no such office is available, at a mutually agreeable and reasonable
      venue within the State, for the term specified above for the purposes of

            explaining how to access family planning services through the
            Designated Third Party Contractor and the list of participating
            providers available through that arrangement. This material will be
            furnished by SDOH to the Contractor and must be mailed with the
            first new Enrollee communication.

      6)    If an Enrollee or prospective Enrollee requests information about
            these family planning and reproductive health services, the
            Contractor will advise the Enrollee or prospective Enrollee as

            b.    Enrollees can receive these non-covered services using the
                  Designated Third Party Contractor.

            c.    The Contractor will mail to each Enrollee or prospective
                  Enrollee who calls for information about family planning and
                  reproductive health services, a copy of the SDOH approved
                  letter explaining the Enrollee's right to receive these

                  Designated Third Party Contractor for family planning
                  services.

            number, and the date the SDOH approved letter and SDOH approved list
            were mailed. The Contractor will review this log monthly and upon
            request, submit a copy to SDOH by county.

      8)    Mechanisms to inform Participating Providers that, if requested by
            the Enrollee, or if in the provider's best professional judgement,
            certain reproductive health and family planning services not offered
            through the Contractor are medically indicated in accordance with
            generally accepted standards of professional practice, an
            appropriately trained professional should so advise the Enrollee and
            provide the Enrollee with a list of providers available through the
            Designated Third Party Contractor, or give the Enrollee the member
            services number to call to obtain this listing.

      9)    The Contractor must recognize that the exchange of medical
            information, when indicated in accordance with generally accepted

            practice, is necessary for the overall coordination of Enrollees'
            care and will assist primary care providers in providing the highest
            quality care to the Contractor's Enrollees. The Contractor must
            acknowledge that medical record information maintained by network
            providers may include information relating to family planning
            services provided under separate contract with SDOH.

      10)   Quality assurance initiatives to ensure compliance with this policy.
            These should include the following procedures:

            a.    The Contractor will submit any materials to be furnished to
                  Enrollees and providers relating to access to non-covered
                  reproductive health and family planning services to SDOH for
                  its review and approval before issuance. Such materials
                  include, but are not limited to, member handbooks, provider
                  manuals, and marketing materials.

            b.    Monitoring calls to member services and providers will be
                  conducted to assess the quality of the information provided.
                  Call monitoring will be performed weekly by the
                  manager/director or his or her designee.

            c.    Every month, the plan will prepare a list of Enrollees who
                  have been sent a copy of the SDOH approved letter and the SDOH
                  approved list of family planning providers. This information
                  will be submitted to the Chief Operating Officer and
                  President/CEO on a monthly basis.

            d.    The Contractor will provide all new employees with a copy of
                  this policy. The Contractor's orientation programs will
                  include a thorough discussion of all aspects of this policy
                  and procedure. Annual retraining programs for all employees
                  will also be conducted to ensure continuing compliance with
                  this policy.

                             B. Marketing Materials

1.    Definitions

      a)    Marketing materials generally include the concepts of advertising,
            public service announcements, printed publications, and other
            broadcast or electronic messages designed to increase awareness and
            interest in FHPlus and/or a MCO's FHPlus care product. The target
            audience for these marketing materials is low-income, uninsured
            people who do not qualify for Medicaid, and who are living in a
            defined service area.

      b)    Marketing materials include any information that references the
            FHPlus program, is intended for general distribution, and is
            produced in a variety of print, broadcast, and direct marketing
            mediums. These generally include: radio, television, billboards,
            newspapers, leaflets, informational brochures, videos, telephone
            book yellow page ads, letters, and posters. Additional materials
            requiring marketing approval include a listing of items to be
            provided as nominal gifts or incentives.

2.    Marketing Material Requirements

      a)    Marketing materials must be written in prose that is understood at a
            fourth-to sixth-grade reading level and must be printed in at least
            ten (10) point type.

      b)    The Contractor must make available written marketing and other
            informational materials (e.g., member handbooks) in a language other
            than English whenever at least five percent (5%) of the potential
            Enrollees of the Contractor in any county of the service area speak
            that particular language and do not speak English as a first
            language. SDOH will inform the LDSS and the Contractor when the 5%
            threshold has been reached. Marketing materials to be translated
            include those key materials, such as informational brochures, that
            are produced for routine distribution, and which are included within
            the MCO's marketing plan. SDOH will determine the need for other
            than English translations based on county specific census data or
            other available measures.

      c)    Alternate forms of communications must be provided for persons with
            visual, hearing, speech, physical, or developmental disabilities.
            These alternate forms include Braille or audiotapes for the visually
            impaired, TTY access for those with certified speech or hearing
            disabilities, and use of American Sign Language and/or integrative
            technologies.

      d)    The plan name, mailing address (and location, if different), and
            toll free phone number must be prominently displayed on the cover of
            all multi-paged marketing materials.

                                       D-4

<PAGE>

      e)    Marketing materials must not contain false, misleading, or ambiguous
            information--such as "You have been pre-approved for the XYZ Health
            Plan," or "You get free, unlimited visits." Materials must not use
            broad, sweeping statements-- for example, "If you are uninsured, you
            are eligible for FHPlus and/or the XYZ Health Plan."

      f)    The material must accurately reflect general information, which is
            applicable to the average customer of FHPlus.

      g)    The Contractor may not use logos or wording used by government
            agencies if such use could imply or cause confusion about a
            connection between a governmental agency and the Contractor.

      h)    Marketing materials may not take reference to incentives that may
            be available to Enrollees after they join a plan, such as "If you
            join the XYZ plan, you will receive a free baby carriage after you
            complete eight prenatal visits."

      i)    Marketing materials that are prepared for distribution or
            presentation by the LDSS, enrollment broker, SDOH-approved
            Enrollment Facilitators must be provided in a manner that is easily
            understood and appropriate to the target audience. The material
            covered must include sufficient information to assist the individual
            in making an informed choice of MCO.

      j)    The Contractor shall advise potential Enrollees, in written
            materials related to enrollment, to verify with the medical services
            providers they prefer, or have existing relationships with, that
            such medical services providers participate in the selected FHPlus
            MCO's network and are available to serve the Enrollee.

                             C. Marketing Activities

1. Definitions

      a)    Marketing activities are occasions during which marketing
            information and material regarding FHPlus and information about a
            particular MCO's affiliated products are presented. Typically, such
            information is presented both in verbal exchanges and through the
            distribution of written materials, together with the giving away of
            nominal gifts. The informal nature of the marketing activity
            requires MCOs to be forthright in their presentations to allow
            potential Enrollees the exercise of informed choice, and localities
            must provide the best assurances that marketing practices are
            consistent with established guidelines. Any exchange of verbal
            marketing information must include the following:

                  i)    if the plan is not fully capitated for family planning
                        services, the representative must tell the prospective
                        Enrollees that;

                        a)    certain family planning and reproductive health
                              services (such as abortion, sterilization and
                              birth control) are not covered by the Contractor;

                        b)    whenever needed, such services may be obtained
                              from the Designated Third Party Contractor;

                        c)    no referral is needed for such services;

                        d)    there will be no cost to the Enrollee for such
                              services.

      b)    With prior local approval MCOs may engage in marketing activities
            that include community-sponsored social gatherings, provider-hosted
            informational sessions, or MCC-sponsored events. Events may include
            such activities as health fairs workshops on health promotion,
            holiday parties, after school programs, raffles, etc. These events
            must not be restricted to FHPlus eligibles only.

      c)    Media campaigns are the distribution of information/materials
            regarding the FHPlus program and/or a specific MCO for the purpose
            of encouraging the uninsured to join a FHPlus plan. All mediums--
            including television, radio, billboards, subway and bus posters, and
            electronic messages-must be pre-approved by the SDOH at least thirty
            (30) days prior to the campaign. A copy must be simultaneously
            submitted to the SDOH and the affected LDSSs.

2. Marketing Sites

      a)    With prior LOSS approval, MCOs may distribute approved marketing
            material in such places as, an income support maintenance center,
            community centers (if the center agrees and allows all MCOs to use
            the
                                     FHPlus
                                   Appendix D
                                 October 1, 2001
                                       D-7

            center), markets, pharmacies, hospitals and other provider sites,
            schools, health fairs, a resource center established by the LDSS or
            the enrollment counseling contractor, and other areas where
            potential Enrollees are likely to gather.

      b)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from door-to-door solicitation of potential
            Enrollees, or distribution of material, and may not engage in "cold
            calling" inquiries or solicitation.

      c)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from direct marketing or distribution of
            material in hospital emergency rooms including emergency room
            waiting areas. Marketing may not take place in patient rooms or
            treatment areas (except for waiting areas) or other prohibited sites
            unless requested by the individual. LDSS may not allow MCOs to
            market in individual homes without permission of the individual.

      d)    MCOs may not require its Participating Providers to distribute plan-
            prepared communications to their patients.

      e)    Participating Providers may display the marketing materials of their
            contracting MCOs provided that appropriate notice is conspicuously
            posted for all other MCOs with whom the Provider has a contract.

      f)    Participating providers are encouraged to communicate with their
            patients about managed care options and to advise their patients in
            determining the MCO that best meets the health needs of the patient
            and his/her family. Such advice, whether presented verbally or in
            writing, must be individually based and not merely a promotion of
            one plan over another. Providers who wish to let their patients know
            of their affiliation with one or more MCOs must list each MCO with
            whom they hold contracts. In the event marketing material is
            included with such communication, the material, together with the
            intended communication, must be pre-approved by the LDSS before
            distribution.

      g)    In the event a provider is no longer affiliated with a particular
            MCO but remains affiliated with other participant MCOs, the provider
            may notify his/her/its patients of the new status and the impact of
            such change on the patient.

3.    Restricted Marketing Activities

      a)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from misrepresenting the FHPlus program, or the
            program or policy requirements of the LDSS or the SDOH.

<PAGE>

      b)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from purchasing or otherwise acquiring or using
            mailing lists of FHPlus eligibles from third party vendors,
            including providers and LDSS offices.

      c)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from using raffle tickets and event attendance
            or sign-in sheets to develop mailing lists of potential Enrollees.

      d)    MCOs shall not discriminate against Eligible Persons or Enrollees on
            the basis of age, sex, race, creed, physical or mental
            handicap/developmental disability, national origin, sexual
            orientation, type of illness or condition, need for health services
            or the Capitation Rate that the Contractor will receive for such
            Eligible Person. Health assessments may not be performed by MCOs
            prior to enrollment. MCOs may inquire about existing primary care
            relationships of the applicant and explain whether and how such
            relationships may be maintained. Upon request, each potential
            Enrollee shall be provided with a listing of all Participating
            Providers including specialists and facilities in the MCO's network.
            The MCO may respond to a potential Enrollee's question about whether
            a particular specialist is in the network. However, MCOs are
            prohibited from inquiring about the types of specialists utilized by
            the potential Enrollee.

      e)    MCOs may not offer incentives of any kind to FHPlus eligibles to
            join a health plan. "Incentives" are defined as any type of
            inducement whose receipt is contingent upon the recipients joining
            the plan.

      f)    MCOs are responsible for ensuring that their marketing
            representatives engage in professional and courteous behavior in
            their interactions with LDSS staff, staff from other health plans,
            and FHPlus Enrollees. Examples of inappropriate behavior include
            interfering with other health plan presentations, talking negatively
            about another health plan, and participating with FHPlus Enrollees
            during the verification interview with LDSS staff.

      g)    MCOs may offer nominal gifts of not more than $5.00 in fair-market
            value as part of a health fair or other marketing activity to
            stimulate interest in managed care and/or the MCO. Such gifts must
            be pre-approved by the LDSS, and offered without regard to
            enrollment. The MCO must submit a listing of intended items to be
            distributed at marketing activities as nominal gifts. The submission
            of actual samples or photographs of intended nominal gifts will not
            be routinely required, but must be made available upon request by
            the state or local reviewer. Listings of item donors or co-sponsors
            must be submitted along with the description of items.

      h)    MCOs may offer its Enrollees rewards for completing a health goal,
            such as finishing all prenatal visits, participating in a smoking
            cessation session, attending initial orientation sessions upon
            enrollment, and timely

                                     FHPlus
                                   Appendix D

            completion of immunizations or other health related programs. Such
            rewards may not exceed $5000 in fair-market value per Enrollee over
            a twelve (12) month period, and must be related to a health goal.
            MCOs may not make reference to these rewards in their pre-enrollment
            marketing materials or discussions and all such rewards must be
            approved by the LDSS.

      i)    MCOs may not offer financial or other kinds of incentives to
            marketing representatives that use the number of Enrollees as a
            factor in compensation. MCOs may reward representatives based on the
            achievement of health goals by the Enrollee. For example, an MCO may
            offer an incentive to a marketing representative who has enrolled an
            individual who subsequently completes a smoking cessation session
            and stops smoking.

      j)    Individuals employed by MCOs as marketing representatives and
            employees of marketing subcontractors must have successfully
            completed a training program about the basic concepts of managed
            care and the FHPlus enrollee's rights and responsibilities relating
            to membership in managed care. MCOs must submit a copy of the
            training curriculum for their marketing representative to SDOH and
            the LDSS as part of the marketing plan. The MCO shall be responsible
            for the activities of its marketing representatives and the
            activities of any subcontractor or management entity. A marketing
            representative means any individual or entity engaged by the
            Contractor to market on behalf of the Contractor.

      actions being taken by the SDOH in collaboration with LDSSs to protect the
      interests of the program and its clients.

      a)    If an MCO or its representative commits a first time infraction of
            marketing guidelines and the SDOH and or LDSS deems the infraction
            to be minor or unintentional in nature, the SDOH and/or LDSS may
            issue a warning letter to the MCO.

      b)    For subsequent or more serious infractions, the SDOH, in
            collaboration with LDSSs, may impose liquidated damages of

      c)    The SDOH in collaboration with LDSSs may require the MCO to prepare
            a corrective action plan with a specified deadline for
            implementation.

      d)    If the MCO commits further infractions, fails to pay liquidated
            damages within the specified timeframe or fails to implement a
            corrective action plan in a timely manner or commits an egregious
            first-time infraction, the SDOH in collaboration with LDSSs may:

            i)      prohibit the MCO from conducting any marketing activities
                    for a period up to the end of the Agreement period;

                                  INTRODUCTION

This document contains member handbook guidelines for use by managed care
organizations (MCOs) under contract to serve New York FHPlus beneficiaries.
These guidelines may be revised from time to time based on changes in the law
and the changing needs of the program. The guidelines reflect the review
criteria used by the SDOH in its review of all FHPlus member handbooks.
Handbooks and addenda must be approved by SDOH prior to printing and
distribution by MCOs. In addition, the SDOH has developed a model member
handbook at the fourth to sixth grade reading level for use by MCOs. The model
member handbook contains language to address required disclosure regarding
family planning; self-referral policies; obtaining OB/GYN services; the
definitions of medical necessity and emergency services; protocols for
complaints, utilization review, external appeals, fair hearings and newborn
enrollments; and listings of member entitlements, including benefits, rights and
responsibilities, and information available upon request. MCOs must use the
language provided in these required disclosure areas in their member handbooks.
A copy of the model handbook is available from the SDOH Family Health Plus
Program.

GENERAL FORMAT

Member handbooks must be written in a style and reading level that will
accommodate the reading skills of many FHPlus Enrollees. In general the writing
should be at no higher than a sixth-grade level, taking into consideration the
need to incorporate and explain certain technical or unfamiliar terms to assure
accuracy. The text must be printed in at least ten (10) point font. The SDOH
reserves the right to require evidence that a handbook has been tested against
the sixth-grade reading-level standard. Member handbooks must be available in
languages other than English whenever at least five percent (5%) of the
potential Enrollees of the MCO in any county in the MCO's service area speak a
language other than English as a first language.

            to governmental oversight entities.

            improve program performance.

       NYSDOH GUIDELINES FOR THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY CARE AND SERVICES

DEFINITION OF AN "EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION"

      The term "Emergency Medical condition" means a medical or behavioral
      condition, the onset of which is sudden, that manifests itself by symptoms
      of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that a prudent layperson,
      possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health, could reasonably
      expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in:

      i.    Placing the health of the person afflicted with such condition in
            serious jeopardy or, in the case of a behavioral condition, placing
            the health of the person or others in serious jeopardy; or

      ii.   serious impairment to such person's bodily functions; or

      iii.  serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of such person; or

      iv.   serious disfigurement of such person.

      Emergency Medical Services include health care procedures, treatments or
      services, including psychiatric stabilization and medical detoxification
      from drugs or alcohol, that are provided for an emergency medical
      condition.

PROTOCOLS FOR NOTIFICATION/AUTHORIZATION

      Preauthorization for treatment of an Emergency Medical Condition is never
      required.

      In circumstances where notification of arrival in the emergency department
      (ED) is requested by the managed care organization following the
      assessment and stabilization of the Enrollee, the notification process for
      the participating ED should require no more than one (1) phone call (or
      fax), and include a limited amount of standard clinical and demographic
      information.

      Failure by the participating ED to notify the MCO for visits that do not
      meet the definition of an Emergency Medical Condition should not be the
      sole basis for denial of triage fee or other payment-unless it can be
      shown to be part of a pattern of non-notification by the participating ED.
      Non-participating EDs cannot be denied payment on the basis of non-
      notification.

PROTOCOL FOR ACCEPTABLE TRANSFER BETWEEN FACILITIES

      All relevant COBRA requirements must be met.

                                     FHPlus
                                   Appendix G
                                October 1, 2001
                                       G-2

<PAGE>

      MCOs must provide for an appropriate (as determined by the ED physician)
      transfer method/level with personnel as needed.

      MCOs must contact/arrange for an available, accepting physician and
      patient bed at the receiving institution.

      If a patient is not transferred within eight (8) hours to an appropriate
      inpatient setting, after the decision to admit has been made, then
      admission at the original facility is deemed authorized.

PROTOCOLS FOR DISPOSITION

      If, pursuant to a screening evaluation, ED staff determines that a patient
      requires further services (other than emergency medical services), the MCO
      will have two (2) hours to respond to a call from the ED with the
      appropriate person to discuss the case. If such response is longer than
      two (2) hours, that admission or treatment is deemed "authorized" for
      purposes of payment.

      In the event that the MCO/provider suggests a level of care for a specific
      patient deemed inappropriate by the attending physician in the ED, and no
      agreement as to disposition can be reached, a physician from the plan must
      physically come to the ED and evaluate/take responsibility for this
      patient.

TRIAGE FEES

      For emergency room services that do not meet the definition of Emergency
      Medical Condition, the MCO shall pay the hospital a triage fee of $40.00
      in the absence of a negotiated rate.

      Payment of the triage fee is contingent on reasonable notification efforts
      by a participating hospital to the health plan and/or patient's primary
      care provider, so that appropriate follow-up can occur.

              FOR THE PROCESSING OF ENROLLMENTS AND DISENROLLMENTS
                             FOR THE FHPLUS PROGRAM

This appendix is intended to provide general guidelines to MCOs for the
processing of enrollments and disenrollments. Where an enrollment broker exists,
the enrollment broker may be responsible for some or all of LDSS
responsibilities. To allow LDSSs flexibility in developing processes that will
meet their needs, SDOH may require MCOs to follow local district modifications
to specific timeframes and procedures.

A. ENROLLMENT

SDOH RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    The SDOH is responsible for monitoring enrollment activities, including
      facilitated enrollment, and providing technical assistance to LDSSs and
      MCOs to ensure compliance with the State's policies and procedures.

2.    SDOH reviews and approves proposed enrollment materials prior to MCOs
      publishing and disseminating or otherwise using the materials.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

LDSSs are responsible for FHPlus eligibility determinations and the enrollment
of eligible persons into FHPlus MCOs.

1.    LDSSs are responsible for coordinating the FHPlus application and
      enrollment process with SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators consistent
      with SDOH Administration Directives on Family Health Plus and Facilitated
      Enrollment. Such coordination shall include, but not be limited to:

      i)    working with SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators to develop/amend
            protocols for the receipt and processing of applications and for the
            provision of information on managed care options to potential
            Enrollees.

      ii)   providing information to SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators to
            assist in determining a health care provider's participation in
            Medicaid managed care or FHPlus.

      iii)  accepting Medicaid managed care/FHPlus enrollment forms from
            SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators and pending the enrollment
            until eligibility has been established and enrollment can be
            completed in the PCP Subsystem.

                                     FHPlus

                                October 1, 2001
                                      H-2

<PAGE>

      iv)   providing feedback to SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators on
            incomplete or incorrect applications so that problems may be
            addressed in a timely fashion.

      v)    delegating the Medicaid/FHPlus face-to-face interview with the
            applying individual/families to the Enrollment Facilitators or
            establish procedures that allow the facilitator to act as the
            authorized representative for the applicant, for the purposes of a
            face-to-face interview with local district staff.

2.    LDSSs are responsible for ensuring that pre-enrollment information
      provided to individuals eligible for FHPlus is consistent with Social
      Services Law, Section 369-ee and may train persons providing counseling to
      potential Enrollees, including SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators.

3.    LDSSs must ensure that potential Enrollees are informed of the
      availability of FHPlus MCOs and the scope of services covered by each.

4.    LDSSs must ensure that potential Enrollees are informed of the right to
      confidential face-to-face counseling and will make confidential
      face-to-face sessions available upon request.

5.    LDSSs shall ensure that potential Enrollees are advised, in written
      materials related to enrollment, to verify with the medical services
      providers they prefer, or have an existing relationship with, that such
      medical services providers participate in the selected managed care plan's
      provider network and are available to serve the participant.

6.    For enrollments made during face-to-face counseling, if the potential
      Enrollee has a preference for particular medical services providers, LDSSs
      shall ensure that enrollment counselors verify with the medical services
      providers that such medical services providers whom the potential Enrollee
      prefers participate in the MCO's network and are available to serve the
      participant.

7.    LDSSs will approve the Contractor's phone enrollment process, if
      applicable.

8.    LDSSs will determine the status of enrollment applications. Applications
      will be enrolled, pended or denied.

9.    LDSSs enter individual enrollment form data and transmit that data to the
      State's Prepaid Capitation Plan (PCP) Subsystem. The transfer of
      enrollment information may be accomplished by any of the following:

      i)    LDSS directly enters data into PCP Subsystem; or

      ii)   LDSS or Contractor submits a tape to the State, to be edited and
            entered into PCP Subsystem; or

                                     FHPlus

                                      H-3

<PAGE>

      iii)  LDSS electronically transfers data, via a dedicated line or
            Electronic Medicaid Eligibility Verification System (EMEVS) to the
            PCP Subsystem.

10.   LDSSs are required to send SDOH-prescribed notices to applicants or
      Enrollees, which may include but are not limited to the following:

      i)    Notice of Acceptance: This letter informs the applicant of approval
            of eligibility for FHPlus and the name of the MCO selected by the
            applicant.

      ii)   Enrollment Confirmation Notice: This letter indicates the Effective
            Date of Enrollment, the name of the FHPlus MCO and all individuals
            who are being enrolled.

      iii)  Notice of Denial of Enrollment: This letter is used when an
            individual has been determined by LDSS to be ineligible for
            enrollment into FHPlus and it includes notice of fair hearing
            rights.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    In those instances in which the Contractor is directly involved in
      assisting in enrolling Eligible Persons, the Contractor will submit to
      LDSSs, enrollments along with attestations (if applicable) within a
      maximum of five (5) business days from the day the complete enrollment
      application is received by the Contractor (unless otherwise agreed to by
      SDOH and LDSS).

2.    The Contractor must notify new Enrollees of their Effective Date of
      Enrollment.

3.    The Contractor must report any changes in status for its enrolled members
      to LDSSs within five (5) business days of such information becoming known
      to the Contractor.

4.    The Contractor shall advise potential Enrollees, in written materials
      related to enrollment, to verify with the medical services providers they
      prefer, or have an existing relationship with, that such medical services
      providers participate in the MCO's network and are available to serve the
      participant.

B. NEWBORN ENROLLMENTS:

If the Contractor is also a Medicaid MCO, the Contractor agrees to enroll and
provide coverage for eligible newborn children of FHPlus Enrollees effective
from the time of birth.

SDOH Responsibilities:

1.    The SDOH will update WMS with information on the newborn received from
      hospitals, consistent with the requirements its of Section 366-g of the
      Social Services Law as amended by Chapter 412 of the Laws of 1999.

LDSS Responsibilities:

                                     FHPlus
                                   APPENDIX H

                                       H-4

<PAGE>

1.    Grant Medicaid eligibility for newborns for one (1) year if born to a
      woman eligible for and receiving FHPlus on the date of birth. (Social
      Services Law Section 366 (4) (1))

2.    LDSSs must insure that Medicaid coverage is authorized for the unborn
      child as soon as a pregnancy is medically verified.

3.    In the event that an LDSS learns of an Enrollee's pregnancy prior to the
      Contractor, the LDSS is to establish Medicaid eligibility and enroll the
      unborn in the plan of the pregnant woman if that plan participates in
      Medicaid managed care. If the plan does not participate in Medicaid
      managed care, the pregnant woman will be asked to select a Medicaid
      managed care plan for the unborn. If Medicaid managed care is unavailable
      in the district, or is not chosen by the mother, the newborn will be
      eligible for Medicaid fee-for-service coverage, and such information will
      be entered on the WMS.

4.    Upon notification of the birth by the Contractor, Enrollee or hospital,
      the LDSS will update WMS with the demographic data for the newborn. If the
      MCO participates in Medicaid and enrollment has not already taken place,
      LDSSs will enroll the newborn in the mother's plan. The PCP subsystem will
      automatically be updated and the newborn will appear as Medicaid eligible
      on the next month's Roster after the update to WMS. In districts where
      Medicaid managed care is unavailable or is not chosen by the mother, the
      newborn will be eligible for Medicaid fee-for-service coverage.

5.    When an unborn has not been pre-enrolled with the Contractor, LDSSs, upon
      receiving notification of the birth from the Contractor, Enrollee or
      hospital, must retroactively enroll the newborn back to the first (1st)
      day of the month of birth, if the mother was enrolled at that time,
      provided the plan also participates in Medicaid. If not, the newborn will
      be covered by fee-for service Medicaid until such time as the mother
      selects a plan, if available and appropriate.

6.    Where newborns will be enrolled in the mother's MCO, LDSSs must ensure
      that the mother is informed that the effective date of enrollment will be
      the first day of the month of birth.

7.    LDSSs may develop a transmittal form to be used for unborn/newborn
      notification between the Contractor and the LDSS.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    The Contractor must notify the LDSS in writing of any Enrollee that is
      pregnant within thirty (30) days of knowledge of the pregnancy.
      Notifications should be transmitted to the LDSS at least monthly. The
      notifications should contain the pregnant woman's name, Client
      Identification Number (CIN), and the Expected Date of Confinement (EDC).

                                      H-5

<PAGE>

2.    Upon the newborn's birth, the Contractor must send verification of
      infant's demographic data to the LDSS, within five (5) days after
      knowledge of the birth. The demographic data must include: the mother's
      name and CIN, the newborn's name and CIN (if newborn has a CIN), sex and
      the date of birth.

3.    In districts that use an Enrollment Broker, the Contractor shall not
      submit electronic enrollments of newborns to the Enrollment Broker, as
      this will interfere with the retroactive enrollment of the newborn back to
      the first (1st) day of the month of birth. For newborns whose mothers are
      not enrolled in the Contractor's plan, the Contractor may submit an
      electronic enrollment of the newborn to the Enrollment Broker.

4.    MCOs that participate in Medicaid managed care will follow the Enrollment
      Guidelines as outlined in Appendix H of the Medicaid managed care model
      contract.

C. ROSTER RECONCILIATION:

All enrollments are effective the first of the month.

SDOH Responsibilities:

1.    The SDOH maintains both the PCP subsystem enrollment files and the WMS
      eligibility files, using data input by LDSSs. SDOH uses data contained in
      both these files to generate the Roster.

2.    SDOH shall send each MCO and LDSS monthly (according to a schedule
      established by SDOH), a complete list of all Enrollees for which the
      Contractor is expected to assume medical risk beginning on the 1st of the
      following month (First Monthly Roster). Notification to MCOs and LDSSs can
      be accomplished via paper transmission, magnetic media, or via an
      electronic bulletin board.

3.    The SDOH shall also forward an error report as necessary to each MCO and
      LDSS.

4.    On the first (1st) weekend after the first (1st) day of the month
      following the generation of the first (1st) Roster, SDOH shall send MCOs
      and LDSSs a second Roster which contains any additional Enrollees that an
      LDSS has added for enrollment for the current month. The SDOH will also
      include any additions to the error report that have occurred since the
      initial error report was generated.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

1)    LDSSs must notify the Contractor in writing of changes in the Roster and
      error report, no later than the end of the month. (To the extent
      practicable the date specified must allow for timely notice to Enrollees
      regarding their enrollment status.) MCOs and the LDSS may develop
      protocols for the purpose of resolving Roster discrepancies that remain
      unresolved beyond the end of the month.

2)    Enrollment and eligibility issues are reconciled by the LDSS to the extent
      possible, adjusting the PCP subsystem enrollment and WMS eligibility
      files, if appropriate.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1)    The Contractor is at risk for providing Benefit Package services for those
      Enrollees listed on the 1st and 2nd rosters for the month in which the 2nd
      Roster is generated.

2)    The Contractor must submit claims to the State's Fiscal Agent for all
      Eligible Persons that are on the 1st and 2nd Rosters, adjusted to add
      Eligible Persons enrolled by the LDSS after Roster production and to
      remove individuals disenrolled by LDSS after Roster production (as
      notified to the Contractor). In the cases of retroactive disenrollments,
      the Contractor is responsible for submitting an adjustment to void any
      previously paid premiums for the period of retroactive disenrollment,
      where the Contractor was not at risk for the provision of Benefit Package
      services. Mere payment of subcapitation does not constitute "provision of
      Benefit Package services."

D. DISENROLLMENT:

SDOH RESPONSIBILITIES:

      1.    LDSSs may delegate to SDOH the responsibility for the review and
            approval of a MCO-initiated request to disenroll an Enrollee. The
            SDOH will be responsible for notification of the Enrollee of the
            status of the MCO request and if appropriate the right to request a
            fair hearing.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

      1.    The LDSS will accept requests for disenrollment directly from
            Enrollees and may not require Enrollees to approach the MCO for a
            disenrollment form. LDSSs must utilize the State's Disenrollment
            form.

      2.    Enrollees may initiate a request for an expedited disenrollment to
            LDSSs or the SDOH. LDSSs will expedite the disenrollment process in
            those cases where an Enrollee's request for disenrollment involves
            an urgent medical need, or a complaint of non-consensual enrollment.
            If approved, the LDSS will manually process the disenrollment
            through the PCP Subsystem.

      3.    LDSSs will process routine disenrollment requests to take effect on
            the first (1st) day of the following month if the request is made
            BEFORE the fifteenth (15th) day of the month. In no event shall the
            Effective Date of Disenrollment be later than the first (1st) day of
            the second month after the month in which an Enrollee requests a
            disenrollment.

                                     FHPlus
                                   APPENDIX H
                                October 1, 2001
                                      H-7

<PAGE>

      4.    LDSSs will disenroll Enrollees automatically upon death or loss of
            FHPlus eligibility (subject to any remaining a applicable "six
            months guaranteed eligibility" coverage). All such disenrollments
            will be effective at the end of the month in which the death or loss
            of eligibility occurs. However, if a FHPlus Enrollee gains full
            Medicaid eligibility and FHPlus Plan is also a Medicaid managed care
            plan, the LDSS will enroll the individual in the Medicaid Managed
            Care product of the FHPlus plan, unless the individual indicates in
            writing that he/she wishes to enroll in another Medicaid managed
            care plan or receive coverage through Medicaid fee-for-service.

      5.    LDSSs will promptly disenroll Enrollees who request disenrollment
            during their Initial Enrollment Period upon determination that they
            meet good cause criteria as defined by SDOH. The LDSS will provide
            Enrollees with notice of their right to request a fair hearing if
            their disenrollment request is denied. LDSSs will transfer Eligible
            persons to another FHPlus plan, if one is available, upon a
            determination that good cause criteria for disenrollment during the
            Initial Enrollment period are met.

      6.    Retroactive disenrollments are to be used only when absolutely
            necessary. Circumstances warranting a retroactive disenrollment are
            rare and include when an Enrollee is later determined to have
            entered and stayed in a residential institution; to have been
            incarcerated; to have moved out of the County of fiscal
            responsibility subject to any time remaining in the Enrollee's
            guaranteed eligibility period; or to have died - as long as the
            Contractor was not at risk for provision of Benefit Package services
            for any portion of the retroactive period. LDSSs must notify the
            Contractor of a retroactive disenrollment prior to the action. LDSSs
            must find out if the Contractor has made payments to providers on
            behalf of the Enrollee prior to disenrollment. After this
            information is obtained, LDSSs and the Contractor will agree on a
            retroactive disenrollment or prospective disenrollment date.

            a)    Generally the effective dates of retroactive disenrollment for
                  specific circumstances are described below:

<TABLE>

<S>                                                       <C>
-    Death of Enrollee                                    -    First day of the month after death

-   Enrollee  entered  or  stayed                         -    First day of the month following entry or
    in  a residential institution                              first day of the month following
                                                               classification of the stay as permanent,
                                                               subsequent to entry

-    Incarceration                                        -    First day of the month following entry

-    Move by Enrollee outside                             -    First day of the month after the update of
     of District/County of Fiscal Responsibility               the system with the new address

         b)    In all cases of retroactive disenrollment, including
               disenrollments effective the first day of the current month, the
               local district must notice the Contractor at the time of
               disenrollment, of the Contractor's responsibility to submit to
               the SDOH's Fiscal Agent voided premium claims for any full months
               of retroactive disenrollment where the Contractor was not at risk
               for the provision of Benefit Package services during the month.
               However, failure by the LDSS to so notify the Contractor does not
               affect the right of the SDOH to recover the premium payment as
               authorized by Section 3.6 of this Agreement.

   7.    LDSSs are responsible for informing Enrollees of their right to change
         MCOs including any applicable Initial Enrollment Period restrictions.

   8.    LDSSs are responsible for sending SDOH-prescribed notices to Enrollees
         regarding their enrollment status. Where practicable, the process will
         allow for timely notification to Enrollees unless there is "good cause"
         to disenroll more expeditiously. Such notices may include, but are not
         limited to:

         a)    Notice of Disenrollment: This letter will advise the Enrollee of
               the status of an Enrollee initiated (voluntary) disenrollment for
               "good cause", or of an LDSS or Contractor initiated (involuntary)
               disenrollment, including the effective date of disenrollment.

         b)    When LDSSs deny an Enrollee's request for disenrollment for "good
               cause" pursuant to Section 8 of the Agreement; LDSSs must inform
               the Enrollee in writing explaining the reason for the denial,
               stating the facts upon which the denial is based, citing the
               statutory and regulatory authority and advising the Enrollee of
               his/her right to a fair hearing pursuant to 18NYCRR Part 358.

         c)    End of Initial Enrollment Period Notice: Enrollees must be
               notified sixty (60) days before the end of their Initial
               Enrollment Period.

         d)    End of FHPlus Coverage: These notices will advise the Enrollee
               that their FHPlus coverage is ending and contain pertinent
               information regarding fair hearing rights.

   9.    LDSSs or the SDOH will render a decision within thirty (30) days of the
         receipt of a fully documented request for disenrollment. A final
         written determination will be provided to the Enrollee and the
         Contractor by LDSSs or the SDOH. This will include notification to the
         Enrollee of their right to request a fair hearing.

   10.   In those instances where LDSSs and/or the SDOH approve the Contractor's
         request to disenroll an Enrollee, and the Enrollee requests a fair
         hearing, the Contractor will continue to keep the Enrollee in the plan
         until the disposition of the fair hearing, when Aid to Continue is
         allowed by law.

   11.   LDSSs and/or the SDOH will review each Contractor requested
         disenrollment in accordance with protocols established by SDOH in
         conjunction with the applicable oversight agency. Where applicable,
         LDSSs and/or the SDOH, shall consult with local mental health and
         substance abuse authorities in the county when making the determination
         to approve or disapprove the request.

   12.   LDSSs may establish procedures whereby MCOs refer cases which are
         appropriate for an LDSS-initiated disenrollment, and submit supporting
         documentation to the LDSS. The Contractor shall notify the LDSS when it
         learns that its Enrollees have died, moved, been incarcerated, or are
         in receipt of equivalent insurance coverage.

   13.   After LDSSs receive and, if appropriate, approve a request for
         disenrollment either from the Enrollee or the Contractor LDSSs will
         update the PCP subsystem file with an end date. EMEVS and the Fiscal
         Agent are then updated and the Enrollee is removed from the
         Contractor's Roster.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    In those instances where the Contractor directly receives disenrollment
      forms, the Contractor will forward these disenrollment requests to
      LDSSs for processing within five (5) business days. During pulldown week
      these forms may be faxed to the LDSS, followed by transmission of a hard
      copy.

2.    The Contractor must accept and transmit all requests for voluntary
      disenrollments from its Enrollees to the LDSS, and shall not impose any
      barriers to disenrollment requests. The Contractor may require that a
      disenrollment request be in writing, contain the signature of the
      Enrollee, and state the Enrollee's correct MCO or Client Identification
      number.

3.    To initiate an involuntary disenrollment of an Enrollee, the Contractor
      must where applicable:

        a)    Show evidence of professional evaluation ruling out an underlying
              medical condition, alcohol or substance abuse, mental illness,
              mental retardation or other developmental disability as a cause
              for Enrollee behavior.

        b)    Document difficulty encountered with the Enrollee; nature, extent
              and frequency of abusive or harmful behavior, violence, inability
              to treat or engage Enrollee and outreach efforts to Enrollee
              employed.

        c)    Identify and document unique cultural issues that may be affecting
              the Contractor's ability to provide treatment effectively to
              certain Enrollees as well as the appropriateness of providers in
              the network.

<PAGE>

        d)    Document special training offered to providers to improve their
              ability to deal with difficult, non-compliant patients, or those
              having the above mentioned conditions.

4.    The Contractor, once the actions in # 3 above have been taken, will
      provide prior verbal and written notice to the Enrollee, with a copy to
      the LDSS or the SDOH of its intent to request disenrollment. The notice
      will advise the Enrollee that the request has been forwarded to the LDSS
      or the SDOH for review and approval. The notice must include the mailing
      address and telephone number of the LDSS or the SDOH.

5.    The Contractor will not consider an Enrollee disenrolled without
      confirmation from the LDSS or the Roster (as described in Section C of
      this Appendix).

E. EXPEDITED DISENROLLMENTS

Enrollees may request an expedited disenrollment if they have an urgent medical
need to disenroll or if they were non-consensually enrolled in FHPlus. Enrollees
may request expedited disenrollment by LDSSs or SDOH as stated in Section 8.4
(b) of this Agreement.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

      1.    LDSSs, to the extent possible, will process an expedited
            disenrollment within two business days of its determination that an
            expedited disenrollment is warranted. The effective date of
            disenrollments resulting from expedited processing are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
 REASON FOR DISENROLLMENT              EFFECTIVE DATE OF DISENROLLMENT
 ------------------------              -------------------------------

Urgent medical need           - First day of the next month after determination except
                                where medical need requires an earlier disenrollment.

Non-consensual enrollment     - Retroactive to the first day of the month of enrollment,
                                if determined to be in the best interest
                                of the Enrollee.

                                   APPENDIX I

MEDICAL RESIDENTS

(a)   Medical Residents as Primary Care Providers. MCOs may
      utilize medical residents as participants (but not
      designated as 'Primary Care Providers') in the care of
      Enrollees as long as all of the following conditions are
      met:

      1)    Residents are a part of patient care teams headed by
            fully licensed and MCO credentialed attending
            physicians serving patients in one or more training
            sites in an "up weighted" or "designated priority"
            residency program. Residents in a training program
            which was disapproved as a designated priority
            program solely due to the outcome measurement
            requirement for graduates may be eligible to
            participate in such patient care teams.

      2)    Only the attending physicians and certified nurse
            practitioners on the training team, not residents,
            may be credentialed to the MCO and may be empanelled
            with Enrollees. Enrollees must be assigned an
            attending physician or nurse practitioner to act as
            their PCP, though residents on the team may perform
            all or many of the visits to the Enrollee as long as
            the majority of these visits are under the direct
            supervision of the Enrollee's designated PCP.
            Enrollees have the right to request care by their PCP
            in addition or instead of being seen by a resident.

      3)    Residents may work with attending physicians and
            certified nurse practitioners to provide continuity
            of care to patients under the supervision of the
            patient's PCP. Patients must be made aware of the
            resident/attending relationship and be informed of
            their rights to be cared for directly by their PCP.

      4)    Residents eligible to be involved in a continuity
            relationship with patients must be available at least
            20% of the total training time in the continuity of
            care setting and no less than 10% of training time in
            any training year must be in the continuity of care
            setting and no fewer than nine (9) months a year must
            be spent in the continuity of care setting.

      5)    Residents meeting these criteria provide increased
            capacity for enrollment to their team according to
            the following formula:

<TABLE>
<S>                    <C>
PGY-1                   300 per FTE
PGY-2                   750 per FTE
PGY-3                  1125 per FTE
PGY-4                  1500 per FTE

<PAGE>
            Only hours spent routinely scheduled for patient care in the
            continuity of care training site may count as providing capacity and
            are based on 1.0 FTE=40 hours.

      6)    In order for a resident to provide continuity of care to an
            Enrollee, both the resident and the attending PCP must have regular
            hours in the continuity site and must be scheduled to be in the site
            together the majority of the time.

      7)    A preceptor/attending is required to be present a minimum of sixteen
            (16) hours of combined precepting and direct patient care in the
            primary care setting to be counted as a team supervising PCP and
            accept an increased number of Enrollees based upon the residents
            working on his/her team. Time spent in patient care activities at
            other clinical sites or in other activities off-site is not counted
            towards this requirement.

      8)    A sixteen (16) hour per week attending may have no more than four
            (4) residents on their team Attendings spending twenty-four (24)
            hours per week in patient care/supervisory activity at the
            continuity site could have six (6) residents per team. Attendings
            spending thirty-two (32) hours per week could have eight (8)
            residents on their team. Two (2) or more attendings may join
            together to form a larger team as long as the ratio of attending to
            residents does not exceed 1:4 and all attendings comply with the
            sixteen (16) hour minimum.

      9)    Specialty consults must be performed or directly supervised by a MCO
            credentialed specialist. The specialist may be assisted by a
            resident or fellow.

      10)   Responsibility for the care of the Enrollee remains with the
            attending physician. All attending/resident teams must provide
            adequate continuity of care, twenty-four (24) hour a day, seven (7)
            day a week coverage, and appointment and availability access.

      11)   Residents who do not qualify to act as continuity providers as part
            of an attending/resident team may still participate in the episodic
            care of Enrollees as long as that care is under the supervision of
            an attending physician credentialed to a MCO. Such residents would
            not add to the capacity of that attending to empanel Enrollees,
            however.

      12)   Certified nurse practitioners and registered physician's assistants
            may not act as attending preceptors for resident physicians.

(b) MEDICAL RESIDENTS AS SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS

      (1)   Residents may participate in the specialty care of FHPlus managed
            care patients in all settings supervised by fully licensed and
            MCO/PHSP credentialed specialty attending physicians.

      (2)   Only the attending physicians, not residents or fellows, may be
            credentialed by the MCO. Each attending must be credentialed by each
            MCO with which they will participate. Residents may perform all or
            many of the clinical services for the Enrollee as long as these
            clinical services are under the supervision of an appropriately
            credentialed specialty physician. Even when residents are
            credentialed by their program in particular procedures, certifying
            their competence to perform and teach those procedures, the overall
            care of each Enrollee remains the responsibility of the supervising
            MCO-credentialed attending.

      (3)   It is understood that many Enrollees will identify the resident as
            their specialty provider but the responsibility for all clinical
            decision-making remains with the attending physician of record.

      (4)   Enrollees must be given the name of the responsible attending
            physician in writing and be told how they may contact their
            attending physician or covering physician, if needed. This allows
            Enrollees to assist in the communication between their primary care
            provider and specialty attending and enables them to reach the
            specialty attending if an emergency arises in the course of their
            care. Enrollees must be made aware of the resident/attending
            relationship and must have a right to be cared for directly by the
            responsible attending physician, if requested.

      (5)   Enrollees requiring ongoing specialty care must be cared for in a
            continuity of care setting. This requires the ability to make
            follow-up appointments with a particular resident/attending
            physician, or if that provider team is not available, with a member
            of the provider's coverage group in order to insure ongoing
            responsibility for the patient by his/her MCO credentialed
            specialist. The responsible specialist and his/her specialty
            coverage group must be identifiable to the patient as well as to the
            referring primary care provider.

      (6)   Attending specialists must be available for emergency consultation
            and care during non-clinic hours. Emergency coverage may be provided
            by residents under adequate supervision. The attending or a member
            of the attending's coverage group must be available for telephone
            and/or in-person consultation when necessary.

      (7)   All training programs participating in FHPlus managed care must be
            accredited by the appropriate academic accrediting agency.

      (8)   All sites in which residents train must produce legible (preferably
            typewritten) consultation reports. Reports must be transmitted such
            they are received in a time frame consistent with the clinical
            condition of the patient, the urgency of the problem and the need
            for follow-up by the primary care physician. At a minimum, reports
            should be transmitted so that they are received no later than two
            (2) weeks from the date of the specialty visit.

      (9)   Written reports are required at the time of initial consultation and
            again with the receipt of all major significant diagnostic
            information or changes in therapy. In addition, specialists must
            promptly report to the referring primary care physician any
            significant findings or urgent changes in therapy which result from
            the specialty consultation.

All training sites must deliver the same standard of care to all patients
irrespective of payer. Training sites must integrate the care of Medicaid,
FHPlus uninsured and private patients in the same settings.

                      NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
                                 GUIDELINES FOR
                               FAMILY HEALTH PLUS
                               COMPLIANCE WITH THE
                         AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

I.    OBJECTIVES

      Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) provides that no qualified
individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded
from participation in or denied access to the benefits of services, programs or
activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such an
entity. Public entities include State and local government and ADA and Section
504 requirements extend to all programs and services provided by State and local
government. Since FHPlus is a government program, health services provided
through FHPlus Managed Care must be accessible to all that qualify for the
program.

      MCO responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are imposed under Title
II and Section 504 when, as a contractor in a FHPlus program, an MCO is
providing a government service. If an individual provider under contract with
the MCO is not accessible, it is the responsibility of the MCO to make
arrangements to assure that alternative services are provided. The MCO may
determine it is expedient to make arrangements with other providers, or to
describe reasonable alternative means and methods to make these services
accessible through its existing contractors. The goals of compliance with ADA
Title II requirements are to offer a level of services that allows people with
disabilities access to the program in its entirety, and the ability to achieve
the same health care results as any program participant.

      MCO responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are also imposed under
Title III when the MCO functions as a public accommodation providing services to
individuals (e.g. program areas and sites such as marketing, education, member
services, orientation, complaints and appeals). The goals of compliance with ADA
Title III requirements are to offer a level of services that allows people with
disabilities full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities or
accommodations that the entity provides for its customers or clients. New and
altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible. Whenever MCOs
engage in new construction or renovation, compliance is also required with
accessible design and construction standards promulgated pursuant to the ADA as
well as State and local laws. Title III also requires that public accommodations
undertake "readily achievable barrier removal" in existing facilities where
architectural and communications barriers can be removed easily and without much
difficulty or expense.

      The State uses MCO Qualification Standards to qualify MCOs for
participation in the FHPlus Program. Pursuant to the State's responsibility to
assure program access to all FHPlus enrollees, the Plan Qualification Standards
require each MCO to submit an ADA Compliance Plan that describes in detail how
the MCO will make services, programs and activities readily accessible and
useable by individuals with disabilities. In the event that certain program
sites are not readily accessible, the MCO must describe reasonable alternative
methods for making the services or activities accessible and usable.

      The objectives of these guidelines are threefold:

      -     To ensure that MCOs take appropriate steps to measure access and
            assure program accessibility for persons with disabilities;

      -     To provide a framework for MCOs as they develop a plan to assure
            compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and

      -     To provide standards for the review of the MCO Compliance Plans.

      These guidelines include a general standard followed by a discussion of
specific considerations and suggestions of methods for assuring compliance.
Please be advised that, although these guidelines and any subsequent reviews by
State and local governments can give the contractor guidance, it is ultimately
the contractor's obligation to ensure that it complies with its contractual
obligations, as well as with the requirements of the ADA, Section 504, and other
federal, state and local laws. Other federal, state and local statutes and
regulations also prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and may
impose requirements in addition to those established under ADA. For example,
while the ADA covers those impairments that "substantially" limit one or more of
the major life activities of an individual, New York City Human Rights Law
deletes the modifier "substantially".

II.   DEFINITIONS

A.    "Auxiliary aids and services" may include qualified interpreters, note
takers, computer-aided transcription services, written materials, telephone
handset amplifiers, assistive listening systems, telephones compatible with
hearing aids, closed caption decoders, open and closed captioning,
telecommunications devices for enrollees who are deaf or hard of hearing
(TTY/TDD), video test displays, and other effective methods of making aurally
delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments; qualified
readers, taped texts, audio recordings, Braille materials, large print
materials, or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials
available to individuals with visual impairments.

B.    "Disability" means a mental or physical impairment that substantially
limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; a record of
such impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.

III.  SCOPE OF MCO COMPLIANCE PLAN

      The MCO Compliance Plan must address accessibility to services at MCO's
program sites, including both participating provider sites and MCO facilities
intended for use by enrollee.

IV.   PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY

      Public programs and services, when viewed in their entirety must be
readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities. This
standard includes physical

access, non-discrimination in policies and procedures and communication.
Communications with individuals with disabilities are required to be as
effective as communications with others. The MCO Compliance Plan must include a
detailed description of how MCO services, programs, and activities are readily
accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. In the event that full
physical accessibility is not readily available for people with disabilities,
the MCO Compliance Plan will describe the steps or actions the MCO will take to
assure accessibility to services equivalent to those offered at the inaccessible
facilities.

ADDITIONAL ADA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS

      Please note that Title III of the ADA applies to all non-governmental
providers of health care. Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act
prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal
enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or
accommodations of any place of public accommodation. A public accommodation is a
private entity that owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public
accommodation. Places of public accommodation identified by the ADA include, but
are not limited to, stores (including pharmacies) offices (including doctors'
offices), hospitals, health care providers, and social service centers.

      New and altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible.
Barriers must be removed from existing facilities when it is readily achievable,
defined by the ADA as easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense.
Factors to be considered when determining if barrier removal is readily
achievable include the cost of the action, the financial resources of the site
involved, and, if applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent
corporation or entity, if barrier removal is not readily achievable, the ADA
requires alternate methods of making goods and services available. New
facilities must be accessible unless structurally impracticable.

      Title III also requires places of public accommodation to provide any
auxiliary aids and services that are needed to ensure equal access to the
services it offers, unless a fundamental alteration in the nature of services or
an undue burden would result. Auxiliary aids include but are not limited to
qualified sign interpreters, assistive listening systems, readers, large print
materials, etc. Undue burden is defined as "significant difficulty or expense".
The factors to be considered in determining "undue burden" include, but are not
limited to, the nature and cost of the action required and the overall financial
resources of the provider. "Undue burden" is a higher standard than "readily
achievable" in that it requires a greater level of effort on the part of the
public accommodation.

      Please note also that the ADA is not the only law applicable for people
with disabilities. In some cases, State or local laws require more than the ADA.
For example, New York City's Human Rights Law, which also prohibits
discrimination against people with disabilities, includes people whose
impairments are not as "substantial" as the narrower ADA and uses the higher
"undue burden" ("reasonable") standard where the ADA requires only that which is
"readily achievable". New York City's Building Code

does not permit access waivers for newly constructed facilities and requires
incorporation of access features as existing facilities are renovated. Finally,
the State Hospital code sets a higher standard than the ADA for provision of
communication (such as sign language interpreters) for services provided at most
hospitals, even on an outpatient basis.

PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES

      Preventive care means care and services to avert disease/illness and/or
its consequences. There are three levels of preventive care:

      -     Primary, such as immunizations, aimed at preventing disease;

      -     Secondary, such as disease screening programs aimed at early
            detection of disease; and,

      -     Tertiary, such as physical therapy, aimed at restoring function
            after the disease has occurred. Commonly, the term "preventive care"
            is used to designate prevention and early detection programs rather
            than restorative programs.

      MCOs must offer the following preventive services essential for promoting
wellness and preventing illness:

      -     General health education classes.

      -     Pneumonia and influenza immunizations for at risk populations.

      -     Smoking cessation classes, with targeted outreach for young adults
            and pregnant women.

      -     Childbirth education classes.

      -     Parenting classes covering topics such as bathing, feeding, injury
            prevention, sleeping, illness prevention, steps to follow in an
            emergency, growth and development, discipline, signs of illness,
            etc.

      -     Nutrition counseling, with targeted outreach for diabetics and
            pregnant women.

      -     Extended care coordination, as needed, for pregnant women.

      -     HIV testing and counseling.

average knowledge of medicine and health, could reasonably expect the absence of
medical attention to result in:

      -     Placing the health of the person afflicted with such condition in
            serious jeopardy, or in the case of a behavioral condition placing
            the health of such person or others in serious jeopardy;

      -     Serious impairment of such person's bodily functions;

      -     Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of such person; or

      MCOs that allow upgrades of eyeglass frames or additional features cannot
apply the eyeglass benefit towards the cost and bill the difference to the
enrollee. However, if the MCO does not include upgraded eyeglasses or additional
features such as scratch coating, progressive lenses, or photo-gray lenses, the
enrollee may choose to purchase the upgraded frame or feature by paying the
entire cost as a private customer.

      Examinations for diagnosis and treatment for visual defects and/or eye
disease are covered only as necessary and as required by the individual's
particular condition. Examinations that include refraction may be limited to
every two years unless otherwise justified as medically necessary.

      Eyeglasses do not require changing more frequently than every two years
unless medically indicated, such as a change in correction greater than 1/2
diopter, or unless the glasses are lost, damaged, or destroyed.

condition, treatment or surgical procedure by a qualified physician or
appropriate specialist, including one affiliated with a specialty care center. A

event that the Contractor determines that it does not have a Participating
Provider in its network with appropriate training and experience rendering the
Participating Provider capable of providing a second opinion, the Contractor
shall make a referral to an appropriate Non-Participating Provider. The
Contractor shall pay for the cost of the services provided by the
Non-Participating Provider.

SMOKING CESSATION PRODUCTS

      MCOs must cover at least two courses of smoking cessation therapy per
person per year, as medically necessary. A course of treatment is defined as no
more than a 90-day supply, (an original prescription and two (2) refills, even
if less than a 30-day supply is dispensed in any fill). Duplicative use of one
agent is not allowed (i.e., same drug/same dosage form/same strength). Both
prescription and over-the-counter treatments/agents are covered; this includes
nicotine patches, inhalers, nasal sprays, gum, and Zyban (bupropion).

COURT ORDERED SERVICES

jurisdiction which are performed by or under the supervision of a physician,
dentist, or other provider qualified under State Law to furnish medical, dental,
behavioral health (including treatment for mental health and/or alcohol and/or
substance abuse or dependence), or other FHPlus covered services. The MCO is
responsible for payment of those services as covered by the benefit package.

NON-COVERED SERVICES

FHPlus MCOs are not required to provide the following services.

NON-EMERGENT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES

Since enrollees qualify for FHPlus by virtue of meeting higher income
guidelines, it has been assumed that Enrollees will be able to meet the
occasional transportation expenses associated with accessing medical care and
services (the exception being transportation assistance for 19 and 20 year olds
receiving EPSDT services). Local districts will not be administering a
transportation program for FHPlus enrollees.

(Only emergency transportation by ambulance and air ambulance is covered under
FHPlus.)

PERSONAL CARE AGENCY SERVICES

Personal care services are the provision of some or total assistance with
personal hygiene, dressing and feeding; and nutritional and environmental
support (meal preparation and housekeeping). Individuals eligible to receive
such services are generally expected to be in receipt of such services for an
extended period of time (years). They would generally be expected to qualify for
Medicaid, which administers this program through the LDSS. Local districts will
not be administering a personal care program for FHPlus enrollees.

FHPlus does cover short-term home health care, which may include some personal
care tasks provided by home health aides incidental to a certified home health
agency visit; these services are covered in lieu of hospitalization or as part
of a post-partum home visit only.

PRIVATE DUTY NURSING SERVICES

FHPlus does not cover private duty nursing services provided by a private
practitioner.

(FHPlus only covers up to 40 certified home health agency visits per year in
lieu of hospitalization or as part of a post-partum home visit only.)

LONG TERM CARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

FHPlus does not cover skilled nursing services in a RHCF (see 18 NYCRR Section
360-1.4(k)).

(Short-term (i.e., less than 30 days) rehabilitation in such a setting, is a
covered benefit.)

NON-PRESCRIPTION (OTC) DRUGS AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Over-the-counter drugs and medical/surgical supplies are not included in the
benefit package. These items are: consumable, non-reusable, disposable, or serve
a specific rather than incidental purpose, and generally have no salvageable
value (e.g. gauze pads, bandages and diapers).

(Medical supplies routinely furnished on administered as part of a clinic or
office visit are covered. Smoking cessation products, hearing aids and supplies
including batteries, and diabetic supplies and equipment are covered under
FHPlus.)

covered service under FHPlus.

SCHOOL SUPPORTIVE HEALTH SERVICES

The School Supportive Health Services Program (SSHSP) enables school districts

services provided by approved special education programs for children with
disabilities through the age of 21. These services are not covered under FHPlus.

COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAID CASE MANAGEMENT (CMCM)

A program which provides "social work" case management referral services to a

Tuberculosis directly observed therapy (TB/DOT) is the direct observation of
oral ingestion of TB medications to assure patient compliance with the
physician's prescribed medication regimen.

The plan's responsibility is limited to communicating, cooperating and
coordinating clinical management of TB with the TB/DOT provider, if applicable.)

AIDS ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE

Adult Day Health Care Programs (ADHCP) are programs designed to assist
individuals with HIV disease to live more independently in the community or
eliminate the need for residential health care services. Registrants in ADHCP
require a greater range of comprehensive health care services than can be
provided in any single setting, but do not require the level of services
provided in a residential health care setting. This is not a covered service
under FHPlus, however plans should coordinate and refer to these services.

HIV COBRA CASE MANAGEMENT

The HIV COBRA (Community Follow-up Program) Case Management Program is a program
that provides intensive, family-centered case management and community
follow-up activities by case managers, case management technicians, and
community follow-up workers. This is not a covered service under FHPlus, however
plans should coordinate and refer to these services.

HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER

Home and Community Based Services Waivers are programs designed as alternatives
to institutionalization or residential placement for special populations under
the Medicaid program. They are not covered under FHPlus.
