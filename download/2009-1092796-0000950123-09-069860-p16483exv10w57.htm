liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any
Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of
the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption,
loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the
control of the LC Issuer; <U>provided</U> that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
LC Issuer from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by the LC Issuer&#146;s failure
to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the LC Issuer (as finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction), the LC Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the LC Issuer may, in its Permitted
Discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of
such Letter of Credit.

the Borrower Representative of an irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, by facsimile, or
by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative
Agent. Each Borrowing Request and Conversion/Continuation Notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. New York time (i)&nbsp;three (3)&nbsp;Business Days prior to
the requested date of any borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Loans, (ii)&nbsp;three
(3)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the conversion of a LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan, and (iii)&nbsp;one (1)
Business Day prior to the requested date of any borrowing of any Base Rate Loan. Each written
notice of borrowing or conversion shall specify (i)&nbsp;whether the requested borrowing is to be
Revolving Borrowing or an Acquisition Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other,
or a continuation of a LIBOR Loan, (ii)&nbsp;the requested date of the borrowing, continuation or

Interest Period, the Borrower Representative will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of
one month. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if a Default has occurred and is

Default is continuing (i)&nbsp;no outstanding Revolving Loan or Acquisition Loan may be converted to or

Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of
such Lender or the LC Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the LC Issuer and their respective Affiliates
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
that such Lender, the LC Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the LC
Issuer agrees to notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff
and application; <U>provided</U> that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 10.09. <U>Interest Rate Limitation.</U> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the
&#147;<U>Maximum Rate</U>&#148;). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an
amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the
Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrowers. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds
the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)&nbsp;characterize any
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)&nbsp;exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.

(&#147;<U>TCAC&#146;s Obligations</U>&#148;) and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the

any of TCAC&#146;s Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee, notice of protest
for nonpayment and all other formalities. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
Guarantee of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a)&nbsp;the failure of any Loan Party to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against TCAC or any
Guarantor under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b)

of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all TCAC&#146;s Obligations) or
which would impair or eliminate any right of any Guarantor to subrogation.

rights of each Guarantor against TCAC arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation,
contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior
in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all TCAC&#146;s Obligations. In
addition, any indebtedness of TCAC or any Subsidiary now or hereafter held by each Guarantor that
is required by the Credit Agreement to be subordinated to TCAC&#146;s Obligations is hereby subordinated
in right of payment to the prior payment in full of TCAC&#146;s Obligations. If any amount shall be paid
to any Guarantor on account of (i)&nbsp;such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or
similar right or (ii)&nbsp;any such indebtedness at any time when any Secured Obligation then due and
owing has not been paid, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties
and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of
TCAC&#146;s Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 8. <I>General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. </I>In any action or proceeding involving
any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under
this Agreement would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of
its liability under this Agreement, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the
amount of such liability shall, without any further action by any Guarantor, any creditor or any
other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

nonpayment of TCAC&#146;s Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Guarantor

payment, or any part thereof, on any Secured Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored

Upon such termination and at the written request of any Guarantor or its successors or assigns, and

Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized to, and agrees upon request of the Borrowers it

a New Hampshire corporation (&#147;<U>TCAC</U>&#148;), and those additional entities that hereafter become

Documents (&#147;<U>S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations</U>&#148;) and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as
a surety, the due and punctual payment of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations. Each Guarantor waives notice of,
and hereby consents to any agreements or arrangements whatsoever by the Secured Parties with any
other Person pertaining to S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations, including agreements and arrangements for
payment, extension, renewal, subordination, composition, arrangement, discharge or release of the
whole or any part of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations, or for the discharge or surrender of any or all
security, or for the compromise, whether by way of acceptance of part payment or otherwise, and,
the same shall in no way impair each Guarantor&#146;s liability hereunder.

law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to S&#038;W Corp. or any
other Person of any of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its
guarantee, notice of protest for nonpayment and all other formalities. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Guarantee of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a)
the failure of any Loan Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or
remedy against S&#038;W Corp. or any Guarantor under the provisions of the

and release any such security pursuant to the terms of any other Loan Documents; (b)&nbsp;apply such

terms of the Loan Documents.

a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection and waives any right to require that any
resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any of the security held
for payment of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the

any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s
Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense (other than a defense of payment) or setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or
otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert
any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document,

or by any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to
any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any
Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all
S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations) or which would impair or eliminate any right of any Guarantor to
subrogation.

Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one
or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such
security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations, make any

way the liability of each Guarantor hereunder except to the extent S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations have

any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to
extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of each Guarantor

limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law
or in equity against each Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of S&#038;W Corp. or any other
Loan Party to pay any Secured Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises
to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured
Party as designated thereby in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such
Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such Obligations. Upon
payment by each Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party as provided
above, all rights of each Guarantor against S&#038;W Corp. arising as a result thereof by way of right
of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be
subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all
S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of S&#038;W Corp. or any Subsidiary now or
hereafter held by each Guarantor that is required by the Credit Agreement to be subordinated to S&#038;W
Corp.&#146;s Obligations is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of S&#038;W
Corp.&#146;s Obligations. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of (i)&nbsp;such
subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii)&nbsp;any such indebtedness
at any time when any Secured Obligation then due and owing has not been paid, such amount shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the
Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of S&#038;W Corp.&#146;s Obligations, whether matured
or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

this Agreement would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of
its liability under this Agreement, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the
amount of such liability shall, without any further action by any Guarantor, any creditor or any
other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest

allowable in such proceeding) on the Real Estate Loan and the Term Loan; and (ii)&nbsp;all other S&#038;W
Corp.&#146;s Obligations then due and owing, have in each case been indefeasibly paid in full in cash
and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement; <I>provided </I>that any
such Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
any payment, or any part thereof, on any Secured Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be
restored by any Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of S&#038;W Corp., the Guarantors or
otherwise. Upon such termination and at the written request of any Guarantor or its successors or
assigns, and at the cost and expense of such Guarantor or its successors or assigns, the
Administrative Agent shall execute in a timely manner a satisfaction of this Guaranty and such
instruments, documents or agreements as are necessary or desirable to evidence the termination of

successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of
each Guarantor that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each
party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall become effective as
to each Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of each Guarantor shall have been
delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf
of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon each Guarantor and the
Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of
each Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and their respective
successors and assigns, except that neither the Borrowers nor the Guarantors shall have the right
to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted
assignment shall be void) without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders. The
Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized to, and agrees upon request of the Borrowers it
will, release any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder in the event that all the Equity
Interests of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction
permitted by the Credit Agreement.

Borrowers, pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit
Agreement. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it has derived and will derive substantial benefit from
the making of the Loans by the Lenders to the Borrowers. As consideration therefor and in order to
induce the Lenders to make Loans, each Guarantor is willing to execute this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1. <I>Guarantee. </I>Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly with any other
Guarantor of the several Obligations of Holdings under the Credit Agreement and other Loan
Documents (&#147;<U>Holdings&#146; Obligations</U>&#148;) and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a
surety, the due and punctual payment of Holdings&#146; Obligations. Each Guarantor waives notice of, and
hereby consents to any agreements or arrangements whatsoever by the Secured Parties with any other
Person pertaining to Holdings&#146; Obligations, including agreements and arrangements for payment,
extension, renewal, subordination, composition, arrangement, discharge or release of the whole or
any part of Holdings&#146; Obligations, or for the discharge or surrender of any or all security, or for
the compromise, whether by way of acceptance of part payment or otherwise, and, the same shall in
no way impair each Guarantor&#146;s liability hereunder.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2. <I>Holdings&#146; Obligations Not Waived. </I>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to Holdings or any
other Person of any of Holdings&#146; Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its
guarantee, notice of protest for nonpayment and all other formalities. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Guarantee of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a)
the failure of any Loan Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or
remedy against Holdings or any Guarantor under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other
Loan Document or otherwise; (b)&nbsp;any extension, renewal or

with respect to any Guarantor under the Loan Documents; (d)&nbsp;the release of (or the failure to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 3. <I>Security. </I>Each Guarantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to (a)&nbsp;take and hold
security for the payment of this Guaranty and Holdings&#146; Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive
and release any such security pursuant to the terms of any other Loan Documents; (b)&nbsp;apply such
security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as it in its sole discretion may determine
subject to the terms of any other Loan Documents; and (c)&nbsp;release or substitute any one or more
endorsees, other Guarantors or other obligors pursuant to the terms of any other Loan Documents. In
no event shall this Section&nbsp;3 require any Guarantor to grant security, except as required by the
terms of the Loan Documents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4. <I>Guarantee of Payment. </I>Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee constitutes
a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection and waives any right to require that any
resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any of the security held
for payment of Holdings&#146; Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the
books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of Holdings or any other
Person.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 5. <I>No Discharge or Diminishment of Guaranty. </I>The obligations of each Guarantor
hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any
reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of Holdings&#146; Obligations), including
any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of Holdings&#146; Obligations,
and shall not be subject to any defense (other than a defense of payment) or setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of
Holdings&#146; Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected
by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand
or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any guarantee or any
other agreement or instrument, by any amendment, waiver or modification of any provision of the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or other agreement or instrument, by any default,
failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of Holdings&#146; Obligations, or by any
other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent
vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a
matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Holdings&#146;
Obligations) or which would impair or eliminate any right of any Guarantor to subrogation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 6. <I>Defenses Waived. </I>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor

Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one
or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such
security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of Holdings&#146; Obligations, make any
other accommodation with Holdings or any other Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy
available to them against Holdings or any other Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any
way the liability of each Guarantor hereunder except to the extent Holdings&#146; Obligations have been
fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any
such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to
extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of each Guarantor
against Holdings or any other Guarantor or any security.

limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law
or in equity against each Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of Holdings or any other
Loan Party to pay any Secured Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises
to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured
Party as designated thereby in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such
Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such Obligations. Upon
payment by each Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party as provided
above, all rights of each Guarantor against Holdings arising as a result thereof by way of right of
subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be
subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all
Holdings&#146; Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of Holdings or any Subsidiary now or hereafter
held by each Guarantor that is required by the Credit Agreement to be subordinated to Holdings&#146;
Obligations is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of Holdings&#146;
Obligations. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of (i)&nbsp;such subrogation,
contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii)&nbsp;any such indebtedness at any time
when any Secured Obligation then due and owing has not been paid, such amount shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative
Agent to be credited against the payment of Holdings&#146; Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under
this Agreement would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of
its liability under this Agreement, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the
amount of such liability shall, without any further action by any Guarantor, any creditor or any
other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

of nonpayment of Holdings&#146; Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each

severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment of the
Obligations. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of, and hereby consents to any agreements or
arrangements whatsoever by the Secured Parties with any other Person pertaining to the Obligations,
including agreements and arrangements for payment, extension, renewal, subordination, composition,
arrangement, discharge or release of the whole or any part of the Obligations, or for the discharge
or surrender of any or all security, or for the compromise, whether by way of acceptance of part
payment or otherwise, and, the same shall in no way impair each Subsidiary Guarantor&#146;s liability
hereunder.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2. <I>Obligations Not Waived. </I>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrowers or
any other Person of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee,
notice of protest for nonpayment and all other formalities. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder

apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as it in its sole discretion may
determine subject to the terms of any other Loan Documents; and (c)&nbsp;release or substitute any one
or more endorsees, other Guarantors or other obligors pursuant to the terms of any other Loan
Documents. In no event shall this Section&nbsp;3 require any Subsidiary Guarantor to grant security,
except as required by the terms of the Loan Documents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4. <I>Guarantee of Payment. </I>Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee
constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection and waives any right to require
that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any of the
security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on
the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of the Borrowers or any
other Person.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 5. <I>No Discharge or Diminishment of Guaranty. </I>The obligations of each Subsidiary
Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination
for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including
any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and
shall not be subject to any defense (other than a defense of payment) or setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of
the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of
each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by
the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or
to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any guarantee or any
other agreement or instrument, by any amendment, waiver or modification of any provision of the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or other agreement or instrument, by any default,
failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act,
omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the
risk of any Subsidiary Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as
a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the
Obligations) or which would impair or eliminate any right of any Guarantor to subrogation.

Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of the unenforceability of the Obligations or
any part thereof from any cause or the cessation from any cause of the liability (other than the
final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations) of the Borrowers or any other
Person. Subject to the terms of the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by
one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of
foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with
the Borrowers or any other Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them
against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been
fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any defense arising
out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair
or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of each
Subsidiary Guarantor against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor or any security.

limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law
or in equity against each Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrowers
or any other Loan Party to pay any Secured Obligation when and as the same shall become due,
whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Subsidiary
Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative
Agent or such other Secured Party as designated thereby in cash an amount equal to the unpaid
principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees
on such Obligations. Upon payment by each Subsidiary Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative
Agent or any Secured Party as provided above, all rights of each Subsidiary Guarantor against the
Borrowers arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement,
indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the
prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of
the Borrowers or any Subsidiary now or hereafter held by each Subsidiary Guarantor that is required
by the Credit Agreement to be subordinated to the Obligations is hereby subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations. If any amount shall be paid to any
Subsidiary Guarantor on account of (i)&nbsp;such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or
similar right or (ii)&nbsp;any such indebtedness at any time when any Secured Obligation then due and
owing has not been paid, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties
and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

Guarantor under this Agreement would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid

bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the
risks that each Subsidiary Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder and agrees that none of the

bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or
allowable in such proceeding) on all Loans; and (ii)&nbsp;all other Obligations then due and owing, have

bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrowers, the Subsidiary Guarantors or otherwise. Upon such
termination and at the written request of any Subsidiary Guarantor or its successors or assigns,
