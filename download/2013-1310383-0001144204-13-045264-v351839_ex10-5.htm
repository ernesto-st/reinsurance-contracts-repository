RIGHT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO PURCHASE INSURANCE</U>: If Borrower fails to provide Administrative Agent with evidence of the
insurance coverages required by this Agreement, Administrative Agent may purchase insurance at Borrower&rsquo;s expense to protect

the Collateral becomes damaged, the coverage Administrative Agent purchases may not pay any claim Borrower makes or any claim made
against Borrower. Borrower may later cancel this coverage by providing evidence that the required property coverage was purchased
elsewhere. Borrower is responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased pursuant to this provision and such cost is payable
on demand; if Borrower fails to pay such cost, it may be added to the Indebtedness and bear interest at the Default Rate. The effective
date of coverage may be the date Borrower&rsquo;s prior coverage lapsed or the date Borrower failed to provide proof of coverage.
The coverage Administrative Agent purchases may be considerably more expensive than insurance Borrower can obtain and may not satisfy
any need for property damage coverage or any mandatory liability insurance imposed by applicable Laws.</P>

or neglect to make any payment or perform any act required by the Loan Documents or the Environmental Indemnity Agreement, then
while any Event of Default exists, and without notice to or demand upon Borrower and without waiving or releasing any other right,
remedy or recourse Administrative Agent may have because of such Event of Default, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to) make such payment or perform such act for the account of and at the expense of Borrower, and shall have the right to enter
upon the Projects for such purpose and to take all such action thereon and with respect to the Projects as it may deem necessary
or appropriate. If Administrative Agent shall elect to pay any sum due with reference to the Projects, Administrative Agent may
do so in reliance on any bill, statement or assessment procured from the appropriate Governmental Authority or other issuer thereof
without inquiring into the accuracy or validity thereof. Similarly, in making any payments to protect the security intended to
be created by the Loan Documents, Administrative Agent shall not be bound to inquire into the validity of any apparent or threatened
adverse title, lien, encumbrance, claim or charge before making an advance for the purpose of preventing or removing the same.
Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold Administrative Agent harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever,
including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, incurred or accruing by reason of any acts performed by Administrative Agent pursuant
to the provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;10.3</U>, including those arising from the joint, concurrent, or comparative negligence
of Administrative Agent , except as a result of Administrative Agent&rsquo;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. All sums paid
by Administrative Agent pursuant to this <U>Section 10.3</U>, and all other sums expended by Administrative Agent to which it shall
be entitled to be indemnified, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of such payment or expenditure
until paid, shall constitute additions to the Loan, shall be secured by the Loan Documents and shall be paid by Borrower to Administrative
Agent upon demand.</P>

expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed
to be paid to Administrative Agent and any Lender or charged by Administrative Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or
detention of the money to be lent hereunder or otherwise, exceed the maximum amount allowed by law. If the Loan would be usurious
under applicable law (including the laws of the State of Illinois and the laws of the United States of America), then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Loan Documents: (a) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under applicable
law that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received under the Loan Documents and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement
shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law, and any excess shall be credited
on the Note by the holder thereof (or, if the Note has been paid in full, refunded to Borrower); and (b) if maturity is accelerated
by reason of an election by Administrative Agent, or in the event of any prepayment, then any consideration which constitutes interest
may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. In such case, excess interest, if any, provided for in
the Loan Documents and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread from the date of advance until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is
uniform through the term hereof. If such amortization, proration, allocation and spreading is not permitted under applicable law,
then such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore
paid, shall be credited on the Note (or, if the Note has been paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms and provisions of
this <U>Section&nbsp;12.9</U> shall control and supersede every other provision of the Loan Documents. The Loan Documents and the
Environmental Indemnity Agreement are contracts made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
the State of Illinois, except that if at any time the laws of the United States of America permit Administrative Agent or the Lenders
to contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the laws of the State of Illinois
(whether such federal laws directly so provide or refer to the law of any state), then such federal laws shall to such extent govern
as to the rate of interest which Administrative Agent or the Lenders may contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive under the

14.5&#9;</B></FONT><B><U>Election of Remedies</U></B>. If Administrative Agent or any Lender may, under applicable law, proceed
to realize its benefits under any of the Loan Documents giving Administrative Agent or such Lender a Lien upon any Collateral,
whether owned by any Borrower or by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or by non-judicial sale or enforcement, Administrative
Agent or any Lender may, at its sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of its
rights and remedies under this <U>Article 14</U>. If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower
or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to &ldquo;election of remedies&rdquo; or the like, each
Borrower hereby consents to such action by Administrative Agent or such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even
if such action by Administrative Agent or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subrogation that
each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Administrative Agent or such Lender. Any election of remedies that
results in the denial or impairment of the right of Administrative Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any
Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower's obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations. In the event Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents,
Administrative Agent or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Obligations and the amount of such bid need not
be paid by Administrative Agent or such Lender but shall be credited against the Obligations. The amount of the successful bid
at any such sale, whether Administrative Agent, Lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed
to be the fair market value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations
shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this <U>Article 14</U>, notwithstanding that
any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which
Administrative Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.</P>
