breach by Employee of this Agreement, or (iii)&nbsp;immediately upon the Employee&#146;s death or disability

Employee thirty (30)&nbsp;days notice of termination, (i)&nbsp;Employee will not, thereafter, be entitled to

injunctive relief brought by Employer or Employee, Employer and Employee agree that any dispute
arising either under this Agreement or from the employment relationship shall be resolved by
arbitration &#151; it is understood that disputes arising either under this Agreement or from the
employment relationship shall be understood to include, but not be limited to, any and all disputes
concerning any claim by the Employee against the Employer/Willis concerning or relating to (i)
alleged illegal discrimination against the Employee in the terms and conditions of employment
(including but not limited to any claim of alleged illegal discrimination on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, gender, national origin, age, physical disability and/or mental disability),
(ii)&nbsp;alleged public policy violations, (iii)&nbsp;alleged wrongful employment termination and/or (iv)
any other disputes arising from or in connection with the employment relationship. Each party
expressly waives any right, whether pursuant to any applicable federal, state, or local statute, to
a jury trial and/or to have a court of law determine rights and award damages with respect to any
such dispute. The party invoking arbitration shall notify the other party in writing (the &#147;Written
Notice&#148;). The parties shall exercise their best efforts, in good faith, to agree upon selection of
a single arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon
selection of a single arbitrator, they shall so notify the American Arbitration Association (&#147;AAA&#148;)
or another agreed upon arbitration administrator and request that the arbitration provider work
with the parties to select a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be (i)&nbsp;conducted in
accordance with the American Arbitration Association&#146;s National Rules for the Resolution of
Employment Disputes, (ii)&nbsp;held at a location reasonably convenient to that office of the Employer

party being notified. The arbitrator shall have no authority to assess punitive or exemplary
damages as to any dispute arising out of or concerning the provisions of this Agreement or
otherwise arising out of the employment relationship, except as and unless such damages are
expressly authorized by otherwise applicable and controlling statutes. The arbitrator&#146;s decision
shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, each party shall bear its own costs, including attorneys&#146; fees, and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">7. <U>Miscellaneous.</U> This Agreement, together with the Offer Letter, sets forth the entire
agreement between the parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings
regarding the subject matter herein. This Agreement may only be modified by a written instrument
signed by both parties. If any term of this Agreement is rendered invalid or unenforceable by
judicial, legislative or administrative action, the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in
full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Except for notices
by Employer to Employee which Employer chooses to hand deliver to Employee, any notices given
pursuant to this Agreement shall be sent by first class US postal service or overnight courier
service to the addresses set forth below (or, to the then current address of a party, with both
parties agreeing to promptly provide the other party with written notice of any change in address).
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its
conflicts of law principles. The waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a waiver of that party&#146;s rights upon any subsequent breach. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon and enforceable against the heirs,
legal representatives and assigns of Employee and the successors and assigns of Employer. Should
Employee be transferred or reassigned from Employer to a parent company or affiliate of Employer,
this Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically assigned by Employer to such new employer.
Employee&#146;s acceptance of Employee&#146;s first payment of compensation from
such new employer shall be deemed as Employee&#146;s acknowledgement of (i)&nbsp;such assignment and (ii)&nbsp;the
continuation of Employee&#146;s employment pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy for Employee&#146;s breach of paragraphs 2 or 3 of this
Agreement and Employer may, in addition to recovering legal damages (including lost commissions and
fees), proceed in equity to enjoin Employee from violating any of the provisions.
