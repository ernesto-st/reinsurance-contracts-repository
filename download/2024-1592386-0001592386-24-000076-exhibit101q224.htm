If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified as to any Borrowing, then the requested Borrowing  shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Term  Benchmark Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one  month&#8217;s duration.  Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03,  the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the applicable Class of the details thereof and of the  amount of such Lender&#8217;s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.  Section 2.04. Funding of Borrowings.   (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof  by wire transfer of immediately available funds in dollars by 12:00 p.m., New York City time or, solely in  the case of an ABR Revolving Borrowing with respect to which the Borrowing Request is made on the date  of the proposed Borrowing, 4:00 p.m., New York City time, to the Applicable Account of the  Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided  that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.23.  The Administrative Agent will make such  Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account  designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans or  Swingline Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.22  shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving  Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.22 to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders  and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the  proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such  Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such  share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.04 and may, in reliance on  such assumption and in its sole discretion, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In  such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the  Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount  equal to such share on demand of the Administrative Agent.  If such Lender does not pay such  corresponding amount forthwith upon demand of the Administrative Agent therefor, the Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower agrees to pay such corresponding amount to  the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand.  The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover  from such Lender or Borrower interest on such corresponding amount, for each day from and including the  date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the  Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and  a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank  compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing in  accordance with Section 2.11.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such  amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.

If any  payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment  shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  In the case of any payment of principal pursuant  to the preceding sentence, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate for the period of such  extension.

(d) Reimbursement Obligations of the Borrower. If any drawing is paid under any Letter of  Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount of (x) the drawing so paid  and (y) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Bank in connection with  such payment, not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following  the day that the Borrower receives such notice from the relevant Issuing Bank.  Each such payment shall  be made to such Issuing Bank at its address for notices referred to herein in dollars and in immediately  available funds.  Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant drawing  is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of  the relevant notice, Section 2.11(b) and (y) thereafter, Section 2.11(c).

The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Banks that  no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for, and the Borrower&#8217;s Reimbursement Obligations under this Section  2.22(e) shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any  endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged,  or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other  party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against  any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee or payment by the applicable Issuing Bank  under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the  terms of such Letter of Credit or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any  of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge  of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower&#8217;s obligations hereunder.  No Issuing Bank shall be  liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or  advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except that the foregoing shall not be  construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as  opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby  waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused  by errors or omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to  have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank.  The Borrower agrees  that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the  related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be  binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Bank to the Borrower; provided,  however, that in no event shall any Issuing Bank have any liability to any other Person for indirect, special,  incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).   (f) Letters of Credit Payment.  If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of  Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof.  The  responsibility of the applicable Issuing Bank to the Borrower in connection with any compliant drawing  presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly  provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each drawing)  delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity  with such Letter of Credit.  </FONT></DIV>

In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; and any  co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent hereunder for purposes  of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security  Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative  Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 8 and Article 9 (including Section  9.03 as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; under the Loan  Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for  the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any  action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any  one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its  duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory  provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each  Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the  syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days&#8217; prior written notice thereof  to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower, whether or not a successor Administrative Agent has  been appointed.  If the Administrative Agent becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding,  or has had a receiver, conservator, trustee or custodian appointed for it, or has consented to, approved of or  acquiesced in any such proceeding or appointment or has a parent company that has become the subject of  a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or has had a receiver, conservator, trustee or custodian appointed  for it, or has consented to, approved of or acquiesced in any such proceeding or appointment and the  Administrative Agent is not performing its role hereunder as Administrative Agent, then the Administrative  Agent may be removed as the Administrative Agent hereunder at the request of the Borrower and the  Required Lenders.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or upon such removal, the Required  Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative  Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment,  within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring  Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor  Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of any  such bank. In either case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower  (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (provided that no consent of the Borrower  shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a), (b), (h) or (i) has occurred and is continuing).  </FONT></DIV>

In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial  proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of  any Loan or outstanding Letter of Credit shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration  or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the  Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and  unpaid in respect of the Loans, outstanding Letters of Credit and all other Secured Obligations that are  owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the  claims of the Lenders and the Agents (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,  disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all  other amounts due the Lenders and the Agents under Sections 2.12 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial  proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such  claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in  any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the  Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments  directly to the Lenders to pay to each Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses,  disbursements and advances of such Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due such  Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.03.

To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold  from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal  Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the  Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender  for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not property  executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance  that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective, or for any other reason),  such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the  Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.15 and  without limiting any obligation of the Borrower to do so pursuant to such Section) fully for all amounts  paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses  incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was  correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

(a) A Subsidiary Loan Party shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Loan  Documents, and all security interests created by the Security Documents in Collateral owned by such  Subsidiary Loan Party shall be automatically released, (1) upon the consummation of any transaction  permitted by this Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party ceases to be a Restricted  Subsidiary (including pursuant to a merger with a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party or designation as an  Unrestricted Subsidiary), (2) upon the request of the Borrower in connection with a transaction permitted  by this Agreement, as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party ceases to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary  (it being understood that, without duplication of any other utilization of Investment capacity in connection  therewith, if Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary shall continue to hold any Investment by a Loan Party  in a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party in an amount equal to the fair market value of such  retained Investment), (3) upon the request of the Borrower, if such Subsidiary Loan Party becomes a  Regulated Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary (other than (i) any Subsidiary Loan Party that becomes an  Excluded Subsidiary solely as a result of ceasing to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary and (ii) any Excluded  Subsidiary that the Borrower, in its sole discretion, elects to maintain as a Guarantor) or (4) upon the written  request of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, if the Borrower elects to cause any Excluded  Subsidiary (other than any Subsidiary Loan Party that is not required to be a Subsidiary Loan Party solely  as a result of (i) being a Foreign Subsidiary and/or (ii) not being a Wholly Owned Subsidiary) that the  Borrower previously elected to cause to become or remain a Subsidiary Loan Party to no longer be  designated as a Subsidiary Loan Party; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) any such release shall  constitute an Investment in such Subsidiary by the Borrower as of the date of such release and (ii) any  Indebtedness or Liens of any such Subsidiary existing at the time of such release shall be deemed to be  incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Loan Party as of the date of such release.  Upon  any sale or other transfer by any Loan Party (other than to Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan  Party) of any Collateral in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, or upon the effectiveness of any  written consent to the release of the security interest created under any Security Document in any Collateral  or the release of Holdings or any Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.02, the security interests in such Collateral created by the Security Documents or such  guarantee shall be automatically released.  Upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, all obligations  under the Loan Documents and all security interests created by the Security Documents shall be  automatically released.  In connection with any termination or release pursuant to this Section or if a Loan  Party requests the Administrative Agent to confirm that its Lien granted under the Security Documents does  not attach to specified Excluded Assets, the Administrative Agent shall, at such Loan Party&#8217;s expense,  return any possessory collateral held by it in respect of any Collateral so released, and execute and deliver  </FONT></DIV>

(b) Holdings may notify the Administrative Agent that it wishes to obtain the release of the  Guarantee of, and grants of Liens by, any Subsidiary Loan Party under the Security Documents (any  Subsidiary in respect of which such a release is given, a &#8220;Released Subsidiary&#8221;), and the Administrative  Agent will, and is hereby authorized to, promptly release such Guarantee and grants of Liens of such  Subsidiary Loan Party pursuant to a written notification thereof given to Holdings; provided that (i) no  Default has occurred or is continuing on the date of such request or would result immediately after giving  effect to such release, and the Administrative Agent has been furnished with a certificate of a Financial  Officer confirming satisfaction of such condition, (ii) after such release is effected, such Restricted  Subsidiary shall thereafter be treated as a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party for purposes of this  Agreement, (iii) the fair market value of such Released Subsidiary immediately after the release of such  Guarantee, as reasonably determined by a Financial Officer, is deemed to be an Investment by a Loan Party  on the date of such release in a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party for purposes of Section 6.04(c) or Section  6.04(m), as designated by Holdings to the Administrative Agent prior to such release, (iv) such Investment  is permitted under Section 6.04(c) or Section 6.04(m), (v) after giving effect to such transaction on a Pro  Forma Basis, not more than 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period shall  be attributable to such Restricted Subsidiary together with all other Restricted Subsidiaries (or any  successors thereto) that were released from being Loan Parties pursuant to the provisions of this Section  9.14 and (vi) the Borrower shall have provided the Administrative Agent such certifications or documents  as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request in order to demonstrate compliance with this  Agreement.    (c) The Administrative Agent will, at the Borrower&#8217;s expense, execute and deliver to the  applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to subordinate its Lien  on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of  any Lien on such property that is of the type permitted by Section 6.02(iv).   (d) Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent  to provide any release or evidence of release, termination or subordination contemplated by this Section  9.14.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing  the Administrative Agent&#8217;s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of  property, or to release any Loan Party from its obligations under any Loan Document, in each case in  accordance with the terms of the Loan Document and this Section 9.14.

Section 9.16. Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the  maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the &#8220;Maximum Rate&#8221;).  If the  Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,  the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal,  refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged or received by the  Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted  by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee or premium rather  than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate  and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the  obligations hereunder.  Section 9.17. Lender Action.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees that it shall not take or  institute any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy against any Loan Party  or any other obligor under any of the Loan Documents (including the exercise of any right of setoff, rights  on account of any banker&#8217;s lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute any actions or  proceedings, or otherwise commence any remedial procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other  property of any such Loan Party, unless expressly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document,  without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  The provisions of this Section 9.17 are for  the sole benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense  available to, any Loan Party.  Section 9.18. Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any  Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other Person  or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations. To the extent that any Loan Party makes  a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to the Administrative Agent, on behalf  of Lenders), or the Administrative Agent or Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights  of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof  are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid  to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common  law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally  intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and  continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement  or setoff had not occurred.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement  or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected  Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion  Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to  be bound by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution  Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an  Affected Financial Institution; and  (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, to the extent applicable:  (i) reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;   (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of  ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be  issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will  be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any  other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write- down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.   Section 9.21. Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that the Loan  Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Agreement or any other  agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221;, and each such QFC, a  &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated  thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit  Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported  QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States  or any other state of the United States):  (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;)  becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported  QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported  QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC  Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be  effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support  (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or  a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes  subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents  that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against  such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be  exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were  governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
