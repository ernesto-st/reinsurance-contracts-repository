<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donegal Group Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) established this 2011 Agency Stock Purchase Plan (this
&#147;Plan&#148;) for the benefit of eligible independent insurance agencies of the Company and Donegal
Mutual Insurance Company (&#147;Donegal Mutual&#148;) and their respective subsidiaries, any insurance
company that the Company or Donegal Mutual owns 50% or more of such company&#146;s stock or any company
from which the Company or Donegal Mutual assumes 100% quota share reinsurance (collectively, the
&#147;Companies&#148;). This Plan provides an Eligible Agency, as defined in Section&nbsp;2, an opportunity to
acquire a long-term proprietary interest in the Company through the purchase of the Company&#146;s Class
A common stock (the &#147;Class&nbsp;A common stock&#148;) at a discount from current market prices. In offering
this Plan, the Company seeks to foster the common interests of the Company and Eligible Agencies in
achieving long-term profitable growth for the Company. Accordingly, the Company has created this
Plan to facilitate the purchase and long-term investment in shares of the Class&nbsp;A common stock by
Eligible Agencies.

(c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;3, through which it may purchase shares of the Class&nbsp;A common stock under this
Plan. Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;11(b), an Eligible Agency may elect any of the payment
methods individually or in combination. In each Subscription Period, as defined in Section&nbsp;4, an
Eligible Agency may contribute an aggregate maximum of $12,000 toward the purchase of Class&nbsp;A
common stock under all payment methods combined (the &#147;Maximum Amount&#148;), subject to the limitations
set forth below:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;An Eligible Agency may elect to purchase Class&nbsp;A common stock through deductions from its
monthly direct bill commission payments. Under this method, an Eligible Agency will direct the
Company to withhold no less than 1% and no more than 10% of the Eligible Agency&#146;s direct bill
commission payments from the Eligible Agency&#146;s direct bill commission payments; provided, however,
that the Company will withhold no more than $12,000 from direct bill commission payments during
each Subscription Period. Direct bill commission payments will mean the commissions earned and
that are actually available for payment in a monthly period to an Eligible Agency for personal and
commercial direct bill policies after all offsetting debits and credits are applied, as determined
solely from the Company&#146;s records.

December&nbsp;31 Subscription Period through a deduction from the contingent commission, if any, payable
to the Eligible Agency under the applicable agency contingent plan or its equivalent. Under this
method, an Eligible Agency will direct the Company to withhold a percentage of the contingent
commission subject to the Maximum Amount.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;An Eligible Agency may elect to purchase Class&nbsp;A common stock through lump-sum payments to

Agency&#146;s total payments exceed the Maximum Amount for that Subscription Period then, upon the
Eligible Agency&#146;s request, the Company will return such excess amount to the Eligible Agency
