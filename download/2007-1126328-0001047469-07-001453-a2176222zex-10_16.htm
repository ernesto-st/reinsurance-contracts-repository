area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are reasonably necessary to protect the Companies' relationships with their employees, clients and

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Companies and Executive have each consulted with their respective legal counsel and have been advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants.

recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections&nbsp;7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure
solely in money the damages that any of the Companies would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations under such Sections. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of
such Sections would irreparably injure the Companies. Accordingly, Executive agrees that any of the Companies shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which such Company may be entitled
under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any actual breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive hereby
waives any right to assert any defense that any of the Companies has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a court determines that any of the covenants included in this Article&nbsp;VII are unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or
geographical or other scope, such court may modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so modified to be enforceable. </FONT></P>

Agreement or any breach or alleged breach thereof shall be submitted to and settled by binding arbitration in Des Moines, Iowa, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (or at any other place or under any other form of arbitration mutually acceptable to the parties so involved). Any dispute, controversy or claim submitted for resolution shall
be submitted to three (3)&nbsp;arbitrators, each of whom is a nationally recognized executive compensation specialist. The Company involved in the dispute, controversy or claim, or PFGI if more than
one Company is so involved, shall select one arbitrator, the Executive shall select one arbitrator and the third arbitrator shall be selected by the first two arbitrators. The arbitrators shall be
required to render their award in a written statement setting forth their findings of fact and the bases for their conclusions. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive upon the parties and a
judgment thereon may be entered in the highest court of a forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne according to Section&nbsp;9.3, except that in
the discretion of the arbitrators any award may include the fees and costs of a party's attorneys if the arbitrator expressly determines that the party against whom such award is entered has caused
the dispute, controversy or claim to be submitted to arbitration in bad faith or as a dilatory tactic. No arbitration shall be commenced after the date when institution of legal or equitable
proceedings based upon such subject matter would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&nbsp;9.11 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, either party may bring an action in the Iowa District </FONT></P>

for Polk County, or the United State District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, if jurisdiction there lies, in order to maintain the status quo ante of the parties. The "status quo ante"
is defined as the last peaceable, uncontested status between the parties. However, neither the party bringing the action nor the party defending the action thereby waives its right to arbitration of
any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&nbsp;9.11 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, either party may seek relief in the form of specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce the decision of the arbitrator. The parties agree that in any
arbitration commenced pursuant to this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to such discovery (including depositions, requests for the production of documents and interrogatories) as would be
available in a federal district court pursuant to Rules&nbsp;26 through 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event that either party fails to comply with its discovery obligations
hereunder, the arbitrator(s) shall have full power and authority to compel disclosure or impose sanctions to the full extent of Rule&nbsp;37, Fed. R. Civ. P. </FONT></P>
