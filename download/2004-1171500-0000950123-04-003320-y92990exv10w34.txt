WHEREAS:

A.       The Parties entered into a UK Master Services Agreement (the
         "AGREEMENT") on 1 November 2002.

B.       Pursuant to Clause 3.4 of the Agreement, Platinum Re UK has requested
         St. Paul Re UK to provide, or procure the provision of, certain
         Transitional Services beyond 30 June 2003 (the "TRANSITIONAL SERVICES
         END DATE").

C.       The Parties wish to record in this ADDENDUM each Transitional Service
         to be provided by St. Paul Re UK to Platinum Re UK beyond the
         Transitional Services End Date and the terms upon which each particular
         Transitional Service will be so provided.

D.       The Parties agree that this Addendum is supplemental to the Agreement,
         but where the terms of this Addendum and those of the Agreement
         conflict, then the terms of this Addendum shall prevail. However,
         nothing in this Addendum shall, nor is it intended to, amend in any way
         the provisions of the Agreement save to the extent explicitly provided
         for herein.

E.       In this Addendum, terms defined in the Agreement are to bear the same
         meaning as they do in the Agreement, save where they are otherwise
         expressly defined in this Addendum.
