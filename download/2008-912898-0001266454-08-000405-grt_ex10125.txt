     2.02 Borrowings; Certain Notices.

               (a) Payments by Borrower. Except to the extent otherwise provided

          Loan Document, shall be made in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available
          funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to Administrative

          Account, not later than 12:00 noon New York time, on the date on which
          such payment shall be due (each such payment made after such time on
          such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding

               (b) Application of Payments. Provided no Event of Default then
          exits, Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this
          Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document for the account of any

          notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans or other amounts
          to which such payment is to be applied (and if Borrower fails to so


                                       18
<PAGE>

          specify, or if an Event of Default exists, Administrative Agent may
          distribute such payment to the Lenders for application in such manner
          as it, subject to Section 2.02(d), may determine to be appropriate).

               (c) Payments to Lenders. Provided Administrative Agent has
          received such payment by 1:00 p.m. New York time, each payment
          received by Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Notes or
          any other Loan Document for account of the Lenders shall, to the
          extent reasonably possible, be paid by Administrative Agent to such
          Lender by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the Business Day on which
          Administrative Agent received such payment, in immediately available
          funds, at the account designated in writing by such Lender from time
          to time. If Administrative Agent has not received such payment by 1:00
          p.m. New York time, such payment shall, to the extent reasonably
          possible, be paid by Administrative Agent to such Lender by 1:00 p.m.
          New York time on the next Business Day following the Business Day on
          which Administrative Agent received such payment, in immediately
          available funds, at the account designated in writing by such Lender
          from time to time.

               (d) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
          herein: (i) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by
          Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in
          accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans
          held by them; and (ii) each payment of interest on Loans by Borrower
          shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance
          with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the
          respective Lenders.

               (e) Extension to Next Business Day. If the due date of any
          payment under this Agreement or any Note would otherwise fall on a day
          that is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next
          succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any
          principal so extended for the period of such extension; provided,
          however, that if such event relates to the Stated Maturity Date,
          payments due on the Stated Maturity Date shall be payable on the
          immediately preceding Business Day.

     2.03 Lending Offices. The Loans made by each Lender shall be made and
maintained at such Lender's Applicable Lending Office.

     2.04 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure of any Lender
to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but no
Lender nor Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make a Loan required to be made by such other Lender. The
amounts payable by Borrower at any time hereunder and under the Note to each
Lender shall be a separate and independent debt.

No Lender shall be entitled to have its Note substituted or exchanged for any
reason, or subdivided for promissory notes of lesser denominations, except in
connection with a permitted assignment of all or any portion of such Lender's
Commitment, Loans and Note pursuant to Section 14.07 (and, if requested by any
Lender in connection with such assignment, Borrower agrees to so exchange any
such Note). In the event of the loss, theft or destruction of any Note, upon
Borrower's receipt of a reasonably satisfactory indemnification agreement
executed in favor of Borrower by the holder of such Note, or in the event of the
mutilation of any Note, upon the surrender of such mutilated Note by the holder
thereof to Borrower, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such holder a
replacement Note in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note. The
Notes shall not be necessary to establish the indebtedness of the Borrower to
the Lenders on account of advances made under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                       PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL

     3.01 Interest.

               (a) Borrower hereby promises to pay to Administrative Agent for
          account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
          Loan made by such Lender for the period from and including the date of
          such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full,
          at the Elected Rate (as defined in the Notes) and in the manner set
          forth in each Note. At all times the Elected Rate shall be the same
          Elected Rate for each of the Notes executed and delivered pursuant to
          this Agreement.

               (b) Promptly after the determination of any interest rate
          provided for under the Notes or any change therein, Administrative
          Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders to which such interest
          is payable and to Borrower, but the failure of Administrative Agent to
          provide such notice shall not affect Borrower's obligation for the
          payment of interest on the Loans.

     3.02 Repayment of Loans. Borrower hereby promises to pay to Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender the principal of such Lender's outstanding
Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, fees and all other amounts due
under the Loan Documents, on the Stated Maturity Date.

     3.03 Sharing of Payments, Etc.

               (a) Sharing. If any Lender obtains from Borrower payment of any
          principal of or interest on any Loan owing to it or payment of any
          other amount under this Agreement or any other Loan Document through
          the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or
          similar right or otherwise (other than from Administrative Agent as
          provided herein), and, as a result of such payment, such Lender shall
          have received a greater percentage of the principal of or interest on
          the Loans or such other amounts then due hereunder or thereunder by
          Borrower to such Lender than the percentage received by any other


                                       20
<PAGE>

          Lender, it shall promptly purchase from such other Lenders
          participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender,
          direct interests in) the Loans or such other amounts, respectively,
          owing to such other Lenders (or in interest due thereon, as the case
          may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to
          time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall
          share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may
          be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such excess
          payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal of and/or
          interest on the Loans or such other amounts, respectively, owing to
          each of the Lenders. To such end, all the Lenders shall make
          appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of
          participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must
          otherwise be restored. Each Lender agrees that it shall turn over to
          Administrative Agent (for distribution by Administrative Agent to the
          other Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) any
          payment (whether voluntary or involuntary, through the exercise of any
          right of setoff or otherwise) on account of the Loans held by it in
          excess of its ratable portion of payments on account of the Loans
          obtained by all the Lenders.

               (b) Consent by Borrower. Borrower agrees that any Lender so
          purchasing such a participation (or direct interest) may exercise
          (subject, as among the Lenders, to Section 9.10) all rights of
          set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to
          such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of
          Loans or other amounts (as the case may be) owing to such Lender in
          the amount of such participation.

               (c) Rights of Lenders; Bankruptcy. Nothing contained herein shall
          require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the
          right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of
          exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or
          obligation of Borrower. If, under any applicable bankruptcy,
          insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim
          in lieu of a set-off to which Section 9.10 applies, then such Lender
          shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of
          such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the
          Lenders entitled under Section 9.10 to share in the benefits of any
          recovery on such secured claim.

                                   ARTICLE IV

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as
now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse

     4.02 Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are within each of
Borrower Party's organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary organizational action under their respective Organizational Documents.
This Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been duly executed and
delivered by Borrower Parties party thereto and each of the Loan Documents to
which a Borrower Party is a party when delivered will constitute, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the applicable Borrower Party, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws of affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     4.03 Government Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not
require any Government Approvals of, registration or filing with, or any other
action by, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) such as have been obtained
or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) filings and recordings in
respect of the Liens created pursuant to the Security Documents, (b) will not
violate any Applicable Law or the Organizational Documents of any of Borrower
Parties, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture,
agreement or other instrument binding upon any of Borrower Parties, or give rise
to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any of Borrower
Parties, and (d) except for the Liens created pursuant to the Security
Documents, will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of any of Borrower Parties.

     4.04 Financial Condition. Borrower has heretofore furnished to each of the
Lenders certain financial statements of Borrower and Guarantor. All such
financial statements are complete and correct in all material respects and
fairly present the financial condition of Borrower and Guarantor as of the dates
of such financial statements, all in accordance with GAAP. Neither Borrower or
Guarantor has on the date hereof any Indebtedness, material contingent
liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or
unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments, except as
referred to or reflected or provided for in said balance sheets as at said
dates. Since the applicable dates of such financial statements, there has been
no event that would have a Material Adverse Effect.

     4.05 Litigation. Except as disclosed in Schedule II hereto, (a) there are
no legal or arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any
Governmental Authority or agency, now pending or (to the Knowledge of Borrower)
threatened against Borrower or the Property and (b) except with respect to
proceedings which, if adversely determined, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, there are no legal or arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or
before any Governmental Authority or agency, now pending or (to the Knowledge of
Borrower) threatened against any other Borrower Party.

     4.06 ERISA. Borrower has not established any Plan which would cause
Borrower to be subject to ERISA and none of Borrower's assets constitutes or
will constitute "plan assets" of one or more Plans. No ERISA Event has occurred

ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan, and,
to the Knowledge of Borrower Parties, each, Multiemployer Plan, is in compliance
with, the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other Applicable Law.

caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
such Borrower Party has set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance

          paid under protest, Borrower shall have furnished such security as may
          be required in the proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by
          Administrative Agent, to insure the payment of any such items,
          together with all interest and penalties thereon, which shall not be
          less than 110% of the maximum liability of Borrower as reasonably
          determined by Administrative Agent, which security shall be deposited
          in a Controlled Account; and (vii) Borrower shall promptly upon final

               (c) If (i) an Event of Default exists, (ii) the Property Manager
          is insolvent, or (iii) the Property Manager is in default of any
          material covenant or obligation under the Property Management
          Agreement, as applicable, beyond the expiration of any applicable
          grace period set forth therein, Borrower shall, at the request of
          Administrative Agent, promptly terminate the Property Management
          Agreement, and replace the Property Manager with a Person approved by

          terms and conditions satisfactory to Administrative Agent.

     5.06 Reserves. Commencing on the first Business Day of the first calendar
month after the occurrence of an Event of Default and continuing thereafter on
the first Business Day of each month thereafter, Borrower shall pay to
Administrative Agent deposits in an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the
yearly amount of Real Estate Taxes, Insurance Premiums [and ground rent] that
will next become due and payable on the Property. The determination of the
amount to be deposited with Administrative Agent with each installment shall be
made by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. Such amounts shall be held
by Administrative Agent in a Controlled Account and applied (together with any
interest earned thereon) to the payment of the obligations in respect to which
such amounts were deposited or, at the option of Administrative Agent, to the
payment of said obligations in such order or priority as Administrative Agent

them would become delinquent. If one (1) month prior to the due date of any of
the aforementioned obligations the amounts then on deposit therefor shall be
insufficient for the payment of such obligations in full, Borrower, within five
(5) Business Days after demand, shall deposit the amount of the deficiency
Administrative Agent into the Controlled Account. Nothing herein contained shall
be deemed to affect any right or remedy of Administrative Agent and/or the
Lenders under the provisions of this Agreement or the other Loans Documents or
of any statute or rule of law to pay any such amount and to add the amount so
paid together with interest at the Default Rate to the indebtedness secured by
the Security Instrument. Borrower hereby pledges to and grants to a security
interest in any and all monies now or hereafter deposited in such Controlled
Account as additional security for the payment of the Loans and agrees to enter
into an agreement with Administrative Agent and the bank where such account is
established substantially in the form in order to perfect Administrative Agent's
security interest therein. In making any payment from such Controlled Account,
Administrative Agent may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate or
procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Real Estate Taxes),
insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums) or the Ground Lessor (with
respect to ground rent), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill,
statement or estimate or into the validity of any such charge.

that such work is performed in a manner which will cause a minimum amount of
disruption to the tenants then in occupancy at the Property and in a manner so
as not to cause a default by Borrower under any other tenants' Leases or provide
the basis for any abatement or set off by any other tenant of the rent payable
under any such Lease, or a claim by any other tenant for breach of warranty of
habitability or similar claim and (g) at Administrative Agent's reasonable
request (but not more frequently than once per year), Borrower shall, within

Administrative Agent. Borrower further hereby agrees that while an Event of
Default exists, Administrative Agent may exercise all rights of Borrower under
the Leases to request the delivery of Tenant Estoppels from the tenants
thereunder.

     5.12 Ground Lease. (a) Borrower covenants and agrees as follows with
respect to the Ground Lease: (i) to promptly and faithfully observe, perform and
comply in all material respects with all of the terms, covenants and provisions

     (b) In the event of a default by Borrower under the Ground Lease, then, in
each and every such case, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to), in its sole discretion and without notice to Borrower, cause such default
or defaults by Borrower to be remedied and otherwise take or perform such other
actions as Administrative Agent may reasonably deem necessary or desirable as a
result thereof or in connection therewith. Borrower shall, on demand, reimburse
Administrative Agent for all advances reasonably made and expenses reasonably
incurred by Administrative Agent in curing any such default(s) (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), together with interest thereon
from the date if different until the same is paid in full to Administrative
Agent and all such sums so advanced shall be secured hereby. The provisions of
this subsection are in addition to any other right or remedy given to or allowed

                                       34

     (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise to the contrary,
Borrower hereby assigns, transfers and sets over to Administrative Agent any and
all rights and interests that may arise in favor of Borrower in connection with
or as a result of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Ground Lessor, as applicable,
including, without limitation, all of Borrower's right, title and interest in,
to and under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 365), as the

contest such claim of taxability.

     (g) As further security for the payment and performance of all Obligations
of Borrower under the Loan Documents, Borrower hereby assigns to Administrative
Agent all rights, privileges and prerogatives which it may have now or in the
future to Modify, reject or assume (pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or other
laws relating to bankruptcy or insolvency) the Ground Lease. Any such
termination, cancellation, modification, rejection or assumption of the Ground
Lease without the prior written consent thereto by Administrative Agent shall be
void and of no force and effect.

     (h) Administrative Agent will have the right to appear in and participate
in all proceedings, including any arbitration proceedings, which could affect
Administrative Agent's security or the provisions of the Ground Lease or which
relate to the Leasehold Parcel. Borrower agrees to pay promptly upon demand all
reasonable costs and expenses of Administrative Agent (including, but not
limited to, legal fees and disbursements) incurred in any such proceedings.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         NEGATIVE COVENANTS OF BORROWER

     Borrower covenants and agrees that, until the payment in full of the
Obligations, it will not do or permit, directly or indirectly, any of the
following:

     6.01 Fundamental Change.

               (a) Mergers; Consolidations; Disposal of Assets. None of Borrower
          or any of the Borrower Parties will merge into or consolidate with any
          other Person, or permit any other Person to merge into or consolidate
          with it, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of (in one
          transaction or in a series of transactions) any substantial part of
          its Properties and assets whether now owned or hereafter acquired (but
          excluding any sale or disposition of obsolete or excess furniture,
          fixture and equipment in the ordinary course of business if same is
          replaced with new furniture, fixtures and equipment of equal or
          greater utility), or wind up, liquidate or dissolve, or enter into any
          agreement to do any of the foregoing.

               (b) Organizational Documents. Without the prior written consent
          of Administrative Agent, Borrower will not make any Modification of
          the terms or provisions in any such Person's Organizational Documents.

     6.02 Limitation on Liens. Borrower will not create, incur, assume or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of the Property or its interest therein, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired, except for the Permitted Liens. Borrower shall not
be in Default under this Section 6.02 if a Lien for the performance of work or
the supply of materials is filed against the Property unless Borrower fails to
discharge such Lien by payment or bonding on or prior to the date that is the
earlier of (a) forty-five (45) days after the date of receipt of notice of the
filing of such lien and (b) the date on which the Property is subject to a levy,
execution, attachment or sequestration.


                                       36
<PAGE>

     6.03 Transfer; Pledge.

               (a) Except as expressly permitted by or pursuant to this
          Agreement, Borrower shall not allow any Transfer to occur or permit
          any owner of the Equity Interests in Borrower to pledge or otherwise
          encumber such Equity Interests, or any of the economic or other
          benefits therefrom.

               (b) Borrower shall not, and shall not permit the General Partner
          to (i) issue, or permit to be issued, any Equity Interests in itself
          other than the Equity Interests and shares, as the case may be, which
          are outstanding on the Closing Date, or any Equity Rights which by
          their terms are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
          any such Equity Interests, (ii) permit any other Person to become the
          General Partner (whether by succession thereof or in addition thereto)
          under Borrower's Organizational Documents or (iii) permit any change
          (whether by succession thereof or in addition thereto) of the General
          Partner under the General Partner's Organizational Documents.

               (c) Borrower acknowledges that Administrative Agent is making one
          or more advances under this Agreement in reliance on the expertise,
          skill and experience of Borrower; thus the Obligations secured by the
          Security Documents include material elements similar in nature to a
          personal service contract. In consideration of Administrative Agent's
          reliance, Borrower agrees that Borrower shall not make any Transfer if
          such Transfer is prohibited by this Agreement unless the Transfer is
          preceded by Administrative Agent's express written consent to the
          particular transaction and transferee. If any prohibited Transfer
          occurs, Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may declare the
          Obligations to be immediately due and payable, and Administrative
          Agent may invoke any rights and remedies provided under Section 7.02
          hereof. Borrower acknowledges the materiality of the provisions of
          this Section 6.03(b) as a covenant of Borrower, and that such covenant
          was given individual weight and consideration by Administrative Agent
          in entering into the Obligations secured by the Security Documents,
          including any Rate Management Agreements, and that any Transfer in
          violation of the prohibited transfer provisions herein set forth shall
          result in a material impairment of Administrative Agent's interest in
          the Obligations and be deemed a breach of the foregoing covenant.

               (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
          6.03, any Change of Control or Transfer which would result in a Change
          of Control (in addition to any other consents or approvals required
          hereunder) shall be further subject to (i) Borrower providing prior
          written notice to Administrative Agent of any such transfer, (ii) no
          Default or Event of Default then existing, (iii) the proposed
          transferee being a corporation, partnership, joint venture,
          joint-stock company, trust or individual approved in writing by each
          Lender subject to a Limiting Regulation in its discretion, and (iv)
          payment to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders of all costs
          and expenses incurred by Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders in
          connection with such transfer. Each Lender at the time subject to a
          Limiting Regulation shall, within ten (10) Business Days after
          receiving Borrower's notice of a proposed Change of Control or
          Transfer subject to this Section 6.03(c), furnish to Borrower a
          certificate (which shall be conclusive absent manifest error) stating


                                       37
<PAGE>

          that it is subject to a Limiting Regulation, whereupon such Lender
          shall have the approval right contained in clause (y) above. Each
          Lender which fails to furnish such a certificate to Borrower during
          such ten (10) Business Day period shall be automatically and
          conclusively deemed not to be subject to a Limiting Regulation. If any
          Lender subject to a Limiting Regulation fails to approve a proposed
          transferee under clause (y) above (any such Lender being herein called
          a "Rejecting Lender"), Borrower, upon three (3) Business Days notice,
          may (A) prepay such Rejecting Lender's outstanding Loans or (B)
          require that such Rejecting Lender transfer all of its right, title
          and interest under this Agreement and such Rejecting Lender's Note to
          an Eligible Assignee designated by Borrower that is approved by
          Administrative Agent provided that such Eligible Assignee assumes all
          of the obligations of such Rejecting Lender hereunder, and purchases
          all of such Rejecting Lender's Loans hereunder for consideration equal
          to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Rejecting
          Lender's Loans, together with interest thereon to the date of such
          purchase (to the extent not paid by Borrower), and satisfactory
          arrangements are made for payment to such Rejecting Lender of all
          other amounts accrued and payable hereunder to such Rejecting Lender
          as of the date of such transfer. Subject to the provisions of Section
          9.07(b), such Eligible Assignee shall be a "Lender" for all purposes
          hereunder. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
          Borrower hereunder, the agreements of Borrower contained in Section
          9.03 shall survive for the benefit of such Rejecting Lender with
          respect to the time period prior to such replacement.

     6.04 Indebtedness. Borrower shall not create, incur or suffer to exist, or
otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable with respect to, any
Indebtedness except the following:

               (a) Indebtedness Under the Loan Documents. Indebtedness of
          Borrower in favor of Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to
          this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

               (b) Trade Payables. Indebtedness of Borrower with respect to
          trade payables and accrued expenses incurred in the ordinary course of
          the business of operating and constructing the Property, provided the
          same are not evidenced by a promissory note, are paid when due, and do
          not exceed in the aggregate at any one time outstanding Three Hundred
          Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00).

     6.05 Investments. Borrower will not make or permit to remain outstanding
any Investments except operating deposit accounts with banks.

     6.06 Change of Organization Structure; Location of Principal Office.
Borrower shall not change its name or change the location of its principal
office, state of formation or organizational structure unless, in each instance,
Borrower shall have (a) given Administrative Agent at least thirty (30) days'
prior notice thereof, (b) made all filings or recordings, and taken all other
action, necessary or desirable under Applicable Law to protect and continue the
priority of the Liens created by the Security Documents, (c) if requested by
Administrative Agent, delivered to Administrative Agent an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent covering the matters referred to
in clause (b) above, and (d) if requested by Administrative Agent, caused the
Title Company to issue an endorsement to the Title Policy reflecting such change
and indicating that there has been no change in the state of title to the
Property as a result of such change.


                                       38
<PAGE>

     6.07 Transactions with Affiliates. Except as expressly permitted by this
Agreement, Borrower shall not enter into, or be a party to, any transaction with
an Affiliate of Borrower, except in the ordinary course of business and on terms
which are fully disclosed to Administrative Agent and are no less favorable to
Borrower than would be obtained in a comparable arm's length transaction with an
unrelated third party.

     6.08 Leases and Security Deposits.

               (a) Negative Covenants. Borrower shall not (i) accept from any
          tenant, nor permit any tenant to pay, Rent for more than one month in
          advance except for payment in the nature of security for performance
          of a tenant's obligations and excluding estimated installments on pass
          through items and other payments provided for in the applicable
          Approved Leases, (ii) Modify (other than ministerial changes), or
          accept surrender of, or renew excepting any options to renew pursuant

     7.02 Remedies.

     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, Administrative Agent may (subject to, and
in accordance with, the provisions of Section 8.03) and, upon request of the
Required Lenders shall, by written notice to Borrower, pursue any one or more of
the following remedies, concurrently or successively, it being the intent hereof
that none of such remedies shall be to the exclusion of any other:

               (a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the entire
          Indebtedness shall thereupon bear interest at the Default Rate of
          Interest, without regard to the Stated Maturity Date, without demand
          made therefor, and without notice to any person, notice of the
          exercise of said option being hereby expressly waived. The Default
          Rate of Interest shall be charged to Borrower upon the occurrence of
          any Event of Default notwithstanding any invoices or billing
          statements sent by Administrative Agent to Borrower indicating an
          interest rate to the contrary. In addition, any waiver of
          Administrative Agent's right to charge the Default Rate of Interest or
          to declare the Indebtedness immediately due and payable must be made
          in writing and cannot be waived by oral representation or the
          submission to Borrower of monthly billing statements;


                                       47
<PAGE>

               (b) In the case of an Event of Default other than one referred to
          in clause (e) or (f) of Section 7.01 with respect to Borrower,
          terminate the Commitments and/or declare the Outstanding Principal
          Amount, and the accrued interest on the Loans and all other amounts
          payable by Borrower hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
          Documents to be forthwith due and payable whereupon such amounts shall
          be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or
          other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
          waived by Borrower; provided, however, that in the case of the
          occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in clause (e) or (f) of
          Section 7.01 with respect to a Borrower Party, the Commitments shall
          automatically be terminated and the Outstanding Principal Amount, and
          the accrued interest on, the Loans and all other amounts payable by
          Borrower hereunder, under the Notes and the other Loan Documents shall
          automatically become immediately due and payable without presentment,
          demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are
          hereby expressly waived by Borrower;

               (c) In the case of any Event of Default resulting from Borrower's
          failure, refusal or neglect to make any payment or perform any act
          required by the Loan Documents, then, while any Event of Default
          exists and without notice to or demand upon Borrower and without
          waiving or releasing any other right, remedy or recourse
          Administrative Agent may have because of such Event of Default,
          Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make such
          payment or perform such act for the account of and at the expense of
          Borrower, and shall have the right to enter upon the Property for such
          purpose and to take all such action thereon and with respect to the
          Property as it may deem necessary or appropriate. If Administrative
          Agent shall elect to pay any sum due with respect to the Property,
          Administrative Agent may do so in reliance on any bill, statement or
          assessment procured from the appropriate Governmental Authority or
          other issuer thereof without inquiring into the accuracy or validity
          thereof. Similarly, in making any payments to protect the security
          intended to be created by the Loan Documents, Administrative Agent
          shall not be bound to inquire into the validity of any apparent or
          threatened adverse title, Lien, encumbrance, claim or charge before
          making an advance for the purpose of preventing or removing the same.
          Additionally, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, if any
          Hazardous Substance affects or threatens to affect the Property,
          Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) give such
          notices and take such actions as it deems necessary or advisable in
          order to abate the discharge of or remove any Hazardous Substance;

               (d) Take possession of the Property and do anything in its sole
          judgment to fulfill the obligations of Borrower hereunder, including
          either the right to avail itself of and procure performance of
          existing contracts and to employ watchmen to protect the Property from
          injury. Without restricting the generality of the foregoing and for
          the purposes aforesaid, Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes
          Administrative Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of
          substitution in the Property to advance funds in excess of the face
          amount of the Notes (and all such amounts shall be payable by Borrower
          together with interest at the Default Rate), to pay, settle, or
          compromise all existing bills and claims, which may be liens or


                                       48
<PAGE>

          security interests, or to avoid such bills and claims becoming liens
          against the Property or security interest against fixtures or
          equipment, or as may be necessary or desirable for the clearance of
          title; to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
          Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; to do
          any and every act which Borrower might do in its own behalf; and to
          prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the
          Property or fixtures or equipment; it being understood and agreed that
          this power of attorney shall be a power coupled with an interest and
          cannot be revoked; and

               (e) Exercise or pursue any other remedy or cause of action
          permitted under this Agreement, any or all of the Security Documents,
          the Rate Management Agreement or any other Loan Document, or conferred
          upon Administrative Agent and the Lenders by operation of law.

     WHETHER OR NOT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS ELECT TO EMPLOY ANY OR
ALL OF THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT,
NEITHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT NOR ANY OF THE LENDERS SHALL BE LIABLE TO PROTECT
THE IMPROVEMENTS OR FOR PAYMENT OF ANY EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
EXERCISE OF ANY REMEDY AVAILABLE TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS OR FOR
THE PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY OTHER OBLIGATION OF BORROWER.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     8.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the other Loan
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Administrative Agent shall be a party to each of the Loan Documents (other than
the Notes) as secured party, beneficiary, indemnitee, and such other applicable
capacities, on behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders (and each Lender hereby
ratifies and reaffirms the Loan Documents so executed and agrees to be bound by
the terms thereof) and hold all Collateral covered thereby for the benefit of
the Lenders, and receive all payments or proceeds received in connection
therewith for the undivided benefit and protection of the Lenders in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. As soon as practicable after
each such receipt of proceeds by Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent
shall determine the respective amounts to be distributed and promptly thereafter
shall credit to itself the amount to which it is entitled (as Administrative
Agent, Lender or otherwise) and wire the amounts to which the other Lenders are
entitled in accordance with such written instruction as each Lender from time to
time may deliver to Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall hold its own Note
and shall receive a copy of each Loan Document. Administrative Agent (which term
as used in this Section 8 shall include reference to its Affiliates and its own
and its Affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents) shall not:


                                       49
<PAGE>

               (a) have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly
          set forth in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents, and shall
          not by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a
          fiduciary or trustee for any Lender except to the extent that
          Administrative Agent acts as an agent with respect to the receipt or
          payment of funds, nor shall Administrative Agent have any fiduciary
          duty to the Borrower nor shall any Lender have any fiduciary duty to
          the Borrower or any other Lender;

               (b) be responsible to the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
          representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
          other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred
          to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this
          Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the value, validity,
          effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
          Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document or any other document
          referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by
          the Borrower or any other Person to perform any of its Obligations
          hereunder or thereunder;

               (c) be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
          it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any other
          document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein
          or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross
          negligence or willful misconduct;

               (d) except to the extent expressly instructed in writing by the
          Required Lenders with respect to collateral security under the Loan
          Documents, be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or
          collection proceedings hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and

               (e) be required to take any action which is contrary to this
          Agreement or any other Loan Document or Governmental Requirement.

     The relationship between and among Administrative Agent and each Lender is
a contractual relationship only, and nothing herein shall be deemed to impose on
Administrative Agent any obligations other than those for which express
provision is made herein or in the other Loan Documents. Administrative Agent
may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it
in good faith. Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of a Note as
the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 9.07. Except to the extent expressly provided in Sections
8.8, 8.10, and 8.11(g), the provisions of this Section 8 are solely for the
benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have
any rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof and the
Administrative Agent and Lenders may, pursuant to a written agreement executed
by all such Persons, Modify or waive such provisions of this Section 8 in their
sole and absolute discretion.

     8.02 Reliance by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any certification, notice, document or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telegram or cable) reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or


                                       50
<PAGE>

on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by
Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or thereunder
in accordance with instructions given by the Required Lenders, and such
instructions of the Required Lenders and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

     8.03 Borrower Defaults.

               (a) Administrative Agent shall give the Lenders notice of any
          material Default of which Administrative Agent has knowledge or
          notice. Except with respect to (i) the nonpayment of principal,
          interest or any fees that are due and payable under any of the Loan
          Documents, (ii) Defaults with respect to which Administrative Agent
          has actually sent written notice of to the Borrower and (iii) Defaults
          with respect to which Administrative Agent has entered into
          discussions with the Borrower, Administrative Agent shall be deemed to
          not have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default unless
          Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower
          specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
          Default". If Administrative Agent has such knowledge or receives such
          a notice from the Borrower or a Lender in accordance with the
          immediately preceding sentence with respect to the occurrence of a
          material Default, Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice
          thereof to the Lenders. Within ten (10) days of delivery of such
          notice of Default from Administrative Agent to the Lenders (or such
          shorter period of time as Administrative Agent determines is
          necessary), Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall consult with
          each other to determine a proposed course of action. Administrative
          Agent shall (subject to Section 8.07) take such action with respect to
          such Default as shall be directed by the Required Lenders; provided
          that (i) unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received
          such directions, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
          to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action (including
          decisions (A) to make Protective Advances that Administrative Agent
          determines are necessary to protect or maintain the Property and (B)
          to foreclose on the Property or exercise any other remedy), with
          respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the interest of
          the Lenders except to the extent that this Agreement expressly
          requires that such action be taken, or not be taken, only with the
          consent or upon the authorization of all of the Lenders and (ii) no
          actions approved by the Required Lenders shall violate the Loan
          Documents or Governmental Requirement.

               (b) Each of the Lenders acknowledges and agrees that no
          individual Lender may separately enforce or exercise any of the
          provisions of any of the Loan Documents (including, without
          limitation, the Notes) other than through Administrative Agent.
          Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of all material actions
          which Administrative Agent takes in accordance with the provisions of
          this Section 803. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Required
          Lenders shall at any time direct that a different or additional
          remedial action be taken from that already undertaken by
          Administrative Agent, including the commencement of foreclosure


                                       51
<PAGE>

          proceedings, such different or additional remedial action shall be
          taken in lieu of or in addition to, the prosecution of such action
          taken by Administrative Agent; provided that all actions already taken
          by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.03(a) shall be valid and
          binding on each Lender.

               (c) All money (other than money subject to the provisions of
          Section 8.03(i) received from any enforcement actions, including the
          proceeds of a foreclosure sale of the Property, shall be applied:
          First, to the payment or reimbursement of Administrative Agent for
          expenses incurred in accordance with the provisions of Sections
          8.03(d), (e) and (f) and 8.05 and to the payment of any fees and
          charges then due agent to the extent not paid by the Borrower; Second,
          to the Lenders for expenses incurred in accordance with the provisions
          of Section 8.03(d), (e) and (f) and 8.05; Third, to the payment or
          reimbursement of the Lenders for any advances made pursuant to Section
          8.03(d); and Fourth, pari passu to the Lenders in accordance with
          their respective Proportionate Shares, unless an Unpaid Amount is owed
          pursuant to Section 8.11, in which event such Unpaid Amount shall be
          deducted from the portion of such proceeds of the Defaulting Lender
          and be applied to payment of such Unpaid Amount to the Special Advance
          Lender.

               (d) All losses with respect to interest (including interest at
          the Default Rate) and other sums payable pursuant to the Notes or
          incurred in connection with the Loans, the enforcement thereof or the
          realization of the security therefor, shall be borne by the Lenders in
          accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares. The Lenders
          shall promptly, upon request, remit to Administrative Agent their
          respective Proportionate Shares of (i) any expenses incurred by
          Administrative Agent in connection with any Default to the extent any
          expenses have not been paid by the Borrower, (ii) any advances made to
          pay taxes or insurance or otherwise to preserve the lien of the Loan
          Documents or to preserve and protect the Property or made to effect
          the completion of the Improvements to be constructed pursuant to this
          Agreement whether or not the amount necessary to be advanced for such
          purposes exceeds the amount of the respective Commitments of the
          Lenders, (iii) any other expenses incurred in connection with the
          enforcement of the Security Instrument or other Loan Documents, and
          (iv) any expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of the
          Loans not paid or provided for by the Borrower. To the extent any such
          advances are recovered in connection with the enforcement of the
          Security Instrument or the other Loan Documents, each Lender shall be
          paid its Proportionate Share of such recovery after deduction of the
          expenses of Administrative Agent.

               (e) If any action is brought to collect on the Notes, foreclose
          under the Security Instrument, or enforce any of the Loan Documents,
          such action shall (to the extent permitted under applicable law and
          the decisions of the court in which such action is brought) be an
          action brought by Administrative Agent and the Lenders, collectively,
          to collect on all or a portion of the Notes or enforce the Loan
          Documents, and counsel selected by Administrative Agent shall
          prosecute any such action on behalf of Administrative Agent and the
          Lenders, and Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall consult and


                                       52
<PAGE>

          cooperate with each other in the prosecution thereof. The costs and
          expenses of foreclosure, to the extent not paid by Borrower within ten
          (10) days after Administrative Agent's demand therefor, will be borne
          by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Proportionate
          Shares.

               (f) If title is acquired to the Property after a foreclosure
          sale, nonjudicial foreclosure or by a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
          title shall be held by Administrative Agent in its own name in trust
          for the Lenders or, at Administrative Agent's election, in the name of
          a wholly owned subsidiary of Administrative Agent on behalf of the
          Lenders.

               (g) If Administrative Agent (or its subsidiary) acquires title to
          the Property or is entitled to possession of the Property during or
          after the foreclosure, all material decisions with respect to the
          possession, ownership, development, construction, control, operation,
          leasing, management and sale of the Property shall be made by
          Administrative Agent. All income or other money received after so
          acquiring title to or taking possession of the Property with respect
          to the Property, including income from the operation and management of
          the Property and the proceeds of a sale of the Property, shall be
          applied: First, to the payment or reimbursement of Administrative
          Agent for expenses incurred in accordance with the provisions of this
          Section 9 and to the payment of any fees and charges then due agent to
          the extent not paid by the Borrower; Second, to the payment of
          operating expenses with respect to the Property; Third, to the
          establishment of reasonable reserves for the operation of the
          Property; Fourth, to the payment or reimbursement of the Lenders for
          any advances made pursuant to Section 8.03(d); Fifth to fund any
          capital improvement, leasing and other reserves established at the
          discretion of Administrative Agent; and Sixth, pari passu to the
          Lenders in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares,
          unless an Unpaid Amount is owed pursuant to Section 8.11, in which
          event such Unpaid Amount shall be deducted from the portion of such
          proceeds of the Defaulting Lender and be applied to payment of such
          Unpaid Amount to the Special Advance Lender.

     8.04 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Loan Commitment and the Loans
made by it, U.S. Bank (and any successor acting as "Administrative Agent"
hereunder) in its capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and
powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not acting as Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless the context otherwise indicates, include Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity as Lender. U.S. Bank (and any successor acting as
"Administrative Agent" hereunder) and any of its Affiliates may (without having
to account therefor to any other Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to,
make investments in and generally engage in any kind of banking, investment
banking, trust or other business with the Borrower (and any of its Affiliates)
as if it were not acting as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank (and any such
successor) and any of its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration
from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise
without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

     8.05 Indemnification. Each Lender agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower, but without limiting the
Obligations of the Borrower hereunder) ratably in accordance with their


                                       53
<PAGE>

Proportionate Shares, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against Administrative Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent (including
by any Lender) arising out of or by reason of any investigation in or in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein (including the
costs and expenses that the Borrower is obligated to pay hereunder) or the
enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent.

     8.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on Administrative Agent
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Borrower and the
Guarantor and its decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document. Subject to
the provisions of Section 8.05 above, Administrative Agent shall not be required
to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or
the Guarantor of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the
properties or books of the Borrower or the Guarantor. Except for notices,
reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished
to the Lenders by Administrative Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the
Borrower or the Guarantor (or any of their Affiliates) that may come into the
possession of Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates. Without limiting
the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall not be responsible in any manner to
any Lender (or any permitted successor or assign of any Lender), and each Lender
represents and warrants that it has not relied upon Administrative Agent for or
in respect of, (a) the creditworthiness of Borrower and the risks involved to
such Lender, (b) the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity, or
the due execution of any Loan Document, (c) any representation, warranty,
document, certificate, report, or statement made therein or furnished thereunder
or in connection therewith, (d) the existence, priority, or perfection of any
Lien granted or purported to be granted under any Loan Document, or (e) the
observation of or compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of
any Loan Document on the part of Borrower.

     8.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of Administrative
Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and
thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from
the Lenders of their indemnification obligations under Section 8.05 against any
and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.


                                       54

     8.08 Resignation of Administrative Agent. It is agreed by the Lenders that
Administrative Agent shall remain Administrative Agent under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents throughout the term of the Loan; provided, however,
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving at least thirty (30) days
prior notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative
Agent that shall be a Person that (1) meets the qualifications of an Eligible
Assignee and (2) if such successor Administrative Agent is not a Lender, as long
as no Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall have the right to approve such
successor Administrative Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If no successor Administrative Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's
giving of notice of resignation of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, that shall be a Person that meets the requirements of
clauses (1) and (2) above, and if such successor Administrative Agent is not a
Lender, the Borrower, as long as no Event of Default exists, shall have the
right to approve such successor Administrative Agent, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the retiring
Administrative Agent shall not be discharged from any liabilities which existed
prior to the effective date of such resignation. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Section 9 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
Administrative Agent.

     8.09 Consents and Certain Actions under, and Modifications of, Loan
Documents.

               (a) Administrative Agent may, except as provided below in clause
          (b) below, (i) grant or refuse to grant any consent or approval
          required or requested of it hereunder or under any of the other Loan
          Documents in its sole and absolute discretion (except where another
          standard of discretion is expressly required of Administrative Agent
          pursuant to the applicable Loan Document), and (ii) consent or refuse
          to consent to any Modification, supplement or waiver under any of the
          Loan Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, such authority shall
          include the power to grant approvals consents and make all decisions
          with respect to all Ministerial Matters. No Lenders shall have the
          right to modify any Notes (or any Loan Documents) without written
          consent of Administrative Agent.

               (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
          other Loan Documents to the contrary, Administrative Agent shall not,
          without the approval of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as
          specified below, have the right or power (and Borrower acknowledges
          and agrees that Administrative Agent shall not have the right or
          power) to grant any consent or approval required or requested of it
          hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, consent to any
          Modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents, or
          take any action, if the effect of such consent, approval,
          Modification, supplement, waiver or action would result in:


                                       55
<PAGE>

          (i)  Without the consent of all Lenders:

               (A) a waiver of any provision regarding the scheduled payment of
               principal of or interest on the Loan;

               (B) the postponement of the Stated Maturity Date;

               (C) the reduction or forgiveness of the principal amount of the
               Loan;

               (D) a decrease the applicable interest rate under the Loan or the
               waiver of any interest (including interest at the Default Rate)
               thereon, except to the extent permitted in the Loan Documents;

               (E) a release of Borrower from its Obligations under the Loan
               Documents, or a release of Guarantor under the Guaranty from its
               obligations with respect to the Loan (except upon payment in full
               of the Loan and all other sums due under the Loan Documents);

               (F) a release of any material portion of the Collateral from the
               lien of the applicable Loan Documents, except to the extent
               permitted in the Loan Documents;

               (G) a waiver of any Late Charges or interest at the Default Rate;

               (H) a consent to any waiver of the prohibitions on Transfer or
               encumbrances of the Property or Equity Interests in Borrower;

               (I) a Modification of the definition of "Required Lenders" or the
               provisions of Section 8, or alters the several nature of the
               Lenders' obligations under the Loan Documents;

          (ii) Without the consent of the Required Lenders:

               (A) a decision to foreclose on, or exercise remedies in order to
               realize upon, any Collateral after a Default or an Event of
               Default, as the case may be or bring any action to enforce the
               Guaranty or other Loan Documents (provided, however, all
               decisions concerning the conduct of any receivership, the manner
               (i.e., judicial, non-judicial, acceptance of deed-in-lieu of
               foreclosure) and conduct of any foreclosure action or trustee's
               sale, the collection of any judgment, the settlement of such
               action, any bid on behalf of Administrative Agent and the Lenders
               at a foreclosure sale, the manner of taking and holding title to
               the Property, and the commencement and conduct of any deficiency
               judgment proceeding shall be made by Administrative Agent);


                                       56
<PAGE>

               (B) a decision made with respect to the sale or disposition of
               the Property or any Collateral after Administrative Agent has
               obtained possession thereof; and

               (C) a decision on the use of application of proceeds from any
               insurance maintained by Borrower or any awards from a taking or
               condemnation of the Property.

          (iii) Without the consent of the affected Lender, changes such
               Lender's Proportionate Share (provided, however, that this clause
               shall not apply to reductions in or a deemed reduction in any
               Lender's Proportionate Share pursuant to Section 8.11 hereof, nor
               shall it be construed to prevent a Lender from assigning its
               interest in the Loan pursuant to Section 9.07).

               (c) If Administrative Agent solicits any consents or approvals
          from the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, each Lender shall
          within ten (10) Business Days of receiving such request, give
          Administrative Agent written notice of its consent or approval or
          denial thereof (or such shorter time as may be required under the
          applicable Loan Document for Administrative Agent to respond, in which
          case Lenders shall have the same time period minus one (1) Business
          Day); provided that if any Lender does not respond within such ten
          (10) Business Days, such Lender shall be deemed to have authorized
          Administrative Agent to vote such Lender's interest with respect to
          the matter which was the subject of Administrative Agent's
          solicitation as Administrative Agent elects. Any such solicitation by
          Administrative Agent for a consent or approval shall be in writing and
          shall include a description of the matter or thing as to which such
          consent or approval is requested and shall include Administrative
          Agent's recommended course of action or determination in respect
          thereof.

     8.10 Authorization. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the
Lenders to execute, deliver and perform in accordance with the terms of each of
the Loan Documents to which Administrative Agent is or is intended to be a party
and each Lender agrees to be bound by all of the agreements of Administrative
Agent contained in such Loan Documents. The Borrower shall be entitled to rely
on all written agreements, approvals and consents received from Administrative
Agent as being that also of the Lenders, without obtaining separate
acknowledgment or proof of authorization of same.

     8.11 Defaulting Lenders.

               (a) If any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender"; and, for purposes
          hereof, any Lenders that is not a Defaulting Lender, a "Non-Defaulting
          Lender") shall for any reason fail to pay its Proportionate Share of
          an advance or disbursement to protect the Property or the lien of the
          Loan Documents, Administrative Agent and any of the Non-Defaulting
          Lenders may, but shall not be obligated to, make all or a portion of
          the Defaulting Lender's Proportionate Share of such advance; provided,
          however, that Administrative Agent or such Non-Defaulting Lender gives
          the Defaulting Lender and Administrative Agent three (3) Business Days
          prior notice of its intention to do so. The right to make such


                                       57
<PAGE>

          advances in respect of the Defaulting Lender shall be exercisable
          first by Administrative Agent, and then by the Non-Defaulting Lender
          holding the greatest Proportionate Share, and thereafter to each of
          the Non-Defaulting Lenders in descending order of their respective
          Proportionate Shares or in such other manner as the Required Lenders
          (excluding the Defaulting Lender) may agree on. Any Lender making all
          or any portion of a Defaulting Lender's Proportionate Share of the
          applicable Loan advance in accordance with the foregoing terms and
          conditions shall be referred to as a "Special Advance Lender". Subject
          to a Defaulting Lender's right to cure as provided in subsection (f),
          but notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this
          Agreement, the Defaulting Lender's interest in, and any amounts due to
          a Defaulting Lender under, the Loan Documents (including, without
          limitation, all principal, interest, fees and expenses) shall be
          subordinate in lien priority and to the repayment of all amounts
          (including, without limitation, interest) then or thereafter due or to
          become due to the other Lenders under the Loan Documents, and the
          Defaulting Lender thereafter shall have no right to participate in any
          discussions among and/or decisions by the Lenders hereunder and/or
          under the other Loan Documents. Further, subject to subsection (f)
          below, any Defaulting Lender shall be bound by any amendment to, or
          waiver of, any provision of, or any action taken or omitted to be
          taken by Administrative Agent and/or the other Lenders under, any Loan
          Document which is made subsequent to the Defaulting Lender becoming a
          Defaulting Lender and, during such period, the Loan Commitment of and
          outstanding principal amount held by such Defaulting Lender shall be
          disregarded in any determination requiring the approval of the Lenders
          or the Required Lenders hereunder.

               (b) In any case where a Non-Defaulting Lender becomes a Special
          Advance Lender (i) the Special Advance Lender shall, at the election
          of such Special Advance Lender, be deemed to have purchased, and the
          Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have sold, a senior participation
          in the Defaulting Lender's respective Loans to the extent of the
          amount so advanced or disbursed (the "Advanced Amount") bearing
          interest at the applicable interest rate (including interest at the
          Default Rate, if applicable) and (ii) the Defaulting Lender shall have
          no voting rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (and
          its Proportionate Share shall be disregarded in determining whether
          any act or decision requiring the approval of the Required Lenders
          shall have been approved) so long as it is a Defaulting Lender. It is
          expressly understood and agreed that each of the respective
          obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan
          Documents, including to advance Loans, to share losses incurred in
          connection with the Loan, including costs and expenses of enforcement
          of the Loans, to make advances to preserve the lien of the Security
          Instrument or to preserve and protect the Property or to effect
          completion of the Improvements to be constructed pursuant to the Loan
          Documents, shall be without regard to any adjustment in the
          Proportionate Shares occasioned by the acts of a Defaulting Lender.
          The Special Advance Lender shall be entitled to an amount (the "Unpaid
          Amount") equal to the applicable Advanced Amount, plus any unpaid
          interest due and owing with respect thereto, less any repayments
          thereof made by the Defaulting Lender immediately upon demand. The
          Defaulting Lender shall have the right to repurchase the senior
          participation in its Loans from the Special Advance Lender pursuant to
          subsection (f) below by the payment of the Unpaid Amount.


                                       58
<PAGE>

               (c) A Special Advance Lender shall (i) give notice to the
          Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders
          (provided that failure to deliver said notice to any party other than
          the Defaulting Lender shall not constitute a default under this
          Agreement) of the Advance Amount and the percentage of the Special
          Advance Lender's senior participation in the Defaulting Lender's Loans
          and (ii) in the event of the repayment of any of the Unpaid Amount by
          the Defaulting Lender, give notice to the Defaulting Lender,
          Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders of the fact that
          the Unpaid Amount has been repaid (in whole or in part), the amount of
          such repayment and, if applicable, the revised percentage of the
          Special Advance Lender's senior participation. Provided that
          Administrative Agent has received notice of such participation,
          Administrative Agent shall have the same obligations to distribute
          interest, principal and other sums received by Administrative Agent
          with respect to a Special Advance Lender's senior participation as
          Administrative Agent has with respect to the distribution of interest,
          principal and other sums under this Agreement; and at the time of
          making any distributions to the Lenders, shall make payments to the
          Special Advance Lender with respect to a Special Advance Lender's
          senior participation in the Defaulting Lender's Loans out of the
          Defaulting Lender's share of any such distributions.

               (d) A Defaulting Lender shall immediately pay to a Special
          Advance Lender all sums of any kind paid to or received by the
          Defaulting Lender from the Borrower, whether pursuant to the terms of
          this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or in connection with the
          realization of the security therefor until the Unpaid Amount is fully
          repaid. Notwithstanding the fact that the Defaulting Lender may
          temporarily hold such sums, the Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to
          hold same as a trustee for the benefit of the Special Advance Lender,
          it being the express intention of the Lenders that the Special Advance
          Lender shall have an ownership interest in such sums to the extent of
          the Unpaid Amount.

               (e) Nothing contained in Section 8.11(a), (f) or (h) shall
          release or in any way limit a Defaulting Lender's obligations as a
          Lender hereunder and/or under any other of the Loan Documents or
          impair the Borrower's right to exercise its remedies against such
          Defaulting Lender which remedies shall include, without limitation,
          the recovery of any losses, costs and expenses incurred as a result
          thereof. Each Defaulting Lender shall indemnify, defend and hold
          Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders harmless from and
          against any and all losses, damages, liabilities or expenses
          (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and interest at the
          Default Rate) which they may sustain or incur by reason of the
          Defaulting Lender's failure or refusal to abide by its obligations
          under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except to the extent
          a Defaulting Lender became a Defaulting Lender due to the gross
          negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent and/or any
          Lender. Administrative Agent shall, after payment of any amounts due
          to any Special Advance Lender pursuant to the terms of subsection (c)
          above, set-off against any payments due to such Defaulting Lender for
          the claims of Administrative Agent and the other Non-Defaulting
          Lenders pursuant to this indemnity.

<PAGE>

               (f) A Defaulting Lender may cure a default arising out its
          failure to fund its Proportionate Share of an advance required
          pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the following, upon such
          cure shall no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, if, within
          five (5) days (the "Default Cure Period") of such default, it pays the
          full amount of the Unpaid Amount, together with interest thereon in
          respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
          Advanced Amount was so paid by the Special Advance Lender until the
          date the Special Advance Lender recovers such amount at a rate per
          annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in the event such cure is made
          within three (3) Business Days of such default; provided, however, if
          such Defaulting Lender fails to cure such default within such three
          (3) Business Days, the Special Advance Lender shall be entitled to
          recover, and such Defaulting Lender shall pay, such amount, on demand
          from Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon in respect
          of each day during the period commencing on such third (3rd) Business
          Day until the date the Special Advance Lender recovers such amount at
          a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate for each such day. If a
          Defaulting Lender pays the Unpaid Amount and interest due thereon
          within the Default Cure Period (or thereafter with the consent of
          Administrative Agent), such Defaulting Lender nonetheless shall be
          bound by any amendment to or waiver of any provision of, or any action
          taken or omitted to be taken by Administrative Agent and/or the other
          Lenders under, any Loan Document which is made subsequent to the
          Lender's becoming a Defaulting Lender and prior to its curing the
          default as provided in this Section 8.11(f); provided that such
          amendment or waiver of action was taken in accordance with the
          provisions of this Agreement. A Defaulting Lender shall have
          absolutely no right to cure any default after the expiration of the
          Default Cure Period unless Administrative Agent, in its sole
          discretion, elects to permit such cure.

               (g) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender and none of the
          other Lenders becomes a Special Advance Lender pursuant to Section
          8.11(a), the Borrower shall have the right, provided there exists no
          Default or Event of Default that has not arisen as a result of the
          Defaulting Lender's failure to fund, to cause another financial
          institution acceptable to Administrative Agent to assume the
          Defaulting Lender's obligations with respect to the Advance Amount on
          the then-existing terms and conditions of the Loan Documents (such
          replacement institution, a "Replacement Lender"). It shall be a
          condition to such assumption that the Replacement Lender concurrently
          assumes the obligations of the Defaulting Lender with respect to the
          unfunded portion of the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender. Such
          assumption shall be pursuant to a written instrument reasonably
          satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Upon such assumption, the
          Replacement Lender shall become a "Lender" for all purposes hereunder,
          with a Loan Commitment in an amount equal to the Advance Amount, and
          the Defaulting Lender's Loan Commitment shall automatically be reduced
          by the Advance Amount. In connection with the foregoing, the Borrower
          shall execute and deliver to the Replacement Lender and the Defaulting


                                       60
<PAGE>

          Lender Replacement Notes. Such Replacement Notes shall be in amounts
          equal to, in the case of the Replacement Lender's note, the Advance
          Amount and, in the case of the Defaulting Lender's note, its
          Commitment, as reduced as aforesaid. Such replacement notes shall
          constitute "Notes" and the obligations evidenced thereby shall be
          secured by the Security Instrument. In connection with the Borrower's
          execution of replacement notes as aforesaid, the Borrower shall
          deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence of the due
          authorization, execution and delivery of the replacement notes and any
          related documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request. The
          execution and delivery of replacement notes as required above shall be
          a condition precedent to any further advances of Loan proceeds. Upon
          receipt of its replacement note, the Defaulting Lender will return to
          the Borrower its note(s) that was replaced; provided that the delivery
          of a replacement note to the Defaulting Lender pursuant to this
          Section 8.11(g) shall operate to void and replace the note(s)
          previously held by the Defaulting Lender regardless of whether or not
          the Defaulting Lender returns same as required hereby.

               (h) In addition to the foregoing, in the event the Defaulting
          Lender has not cured such default within the Default Cure Period,
          Administrative Agent (unless the Lender serving in the capacity of
          Administrative Agent is the Defaulting Lender) and the Non-Defaulting
          Lenders, shall, in accordance wit the priority established pursuant to
          Section 8.11(a) above, be entitled to purchase such Defaulting
          Lender's entire Loan Commitment, excluding accrued and unpaid interest
          thereon, for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal
          balance of all Loans which have been funded by such Defaulting Lender
          as of the date of such purchase.

               (i) The Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall, at the
          Borrower's expense solely with respect to Administrative Agent's
          reasonable costs and expenses in connection therewith, execute such
          modifications to the Loan Documents as shall, in the reasonable
          judgment of Administrative Agent, be necessary in order to effect the
          substitution of Lenders in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
          this Section 8.11(g). The Lenders shall reasonably cooperate with the
          Borrower's attempts to obtain a Replacement Lender, but they shall not
          be obligated to modify the Loan Documents in connection therewith,
          other than modifications pursuant to the immediately preceding
          paragraph.

     8.12 Amendments Concerning Agency Functions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Administrative Agent shall not be
bound by any Modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which
affects its duties, rights, and/or functions hereunder or thereunder unless it
shall have given its prior written consent thereto.

     8.13 Liability of Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall not have
any liabilities or responsibilities to the Borrower on account of the failure of
any Lender (other than Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender) to
perform its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of
the Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
Document.


                                       61
<PAGE>

     8.14 Transfer of Agency Function. Without the consent of the Borrower or
any Lender, Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time transfer
its functions as Administrative Agent hereunder to any of its offices wherever
located in the United States; provided that Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Lenders thereof.

     8.15 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain from the Borrower
payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan owing to it or payment of
any other amount under this Agreement or any other Loan Document through the
exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right
or otherwise (other than from Administrative Agent as provided herein), and, as
a result of such payment, such Lender shall have received a greater percentage
of the principal of or interest on the Loans or such other amounts then due
hereunder or thereunder by the Borrower to such Lender than the percentage
received by any other Lender, it shall promptly purchase from such other Lenders
participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct
interests in) the Loans or such other amounts, respectively, owing to such other
Lenders (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and
make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end
that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any
expenses that may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such
excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal of and/or
interest on the Loan or such other amounts, respectively, owing to each of the
Lenders. To such end, all the Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among
themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. Each Lender agrees that it shall
turn over to Administrative Agent (for distribution by Administrative Agent to
the other Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) any payment
(whether voluntary or involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff
or otherwise) on account of the Loans held by it in excess of its ratable
portion of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders. Nothing
contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall
affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of
exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or Obligation
of the Borrower. If, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a set-off to which
Section 4.13 applies, then such Lender shall, to the extent practicable,
exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with
the rights of the Lenders entitled under Section 4.13 to share in the benefits
of any recovery on such secured claim.

     8.16 Bankruptcy of Borrower. In the event a bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceeding is commenced by or against the Borrower or Guarantor, Administrative
Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right to file and pursue a joint proof
of claim on behalf of the Lenders. Each Lender irrevocably waives its right to
file or pursue a separate proof of claim in any such proceedings.

     8.17 Termination. The rights and obligations of Administrative Agent and
the Lenders shall terminate when the Obligations of Borrower hereunder have been
paid and finally discharged in full and the obligations of the Lenders to
advance funds to the Borrower under this Agreement are terminated or, if the
Administrative Agent or Administrative Agent's nominee takes title to the
Property by foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, when the Property
is thereafter sold to a third-party purchaser. All indemnification provisions in
favor of Administrative Agent herein and in the other Loan Documents shall
survive the termination hereof.

Administrative Agent, any Lender or Borrower to exercise and no delay in
exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or

further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

     9.07 Assignments and Participations.

               (a) Consent Required for Assignments by Borrower. Borrower may

          transfer, or assign any portion of the Loan (each such interest so
          disposed of being herein called a "Transferred Interest") to any
          Person other than an Eligible Assignee (hereinafter called a
          "Transferee"). The parties to any such assignment shall execute and
          deliver to Administrative Agent, for its acceptance, an "Assignment
          and Acceptance Agreement" substantially in the form attached hereto as
          Exhibit E, together with a processing fee of Five Thousand Dollars

          in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement covering all or
          the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
          under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

          Note to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon Borrower
          shall issue new Replacement Notes if so requested by Administrative
          Agent, the assignee and/or the assigning Lender, to the assignee

          the effectiveness thereof. All assignments of Loans or Loan
          Commitments must be reported to Administrative Agent to permit
          registration in the Register. The entries in the Register shall be
          conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower,
          Administrative Agent and Lenders will treat each Person whose name is
          recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
          this Agreement.

               (c) Participations by Lenders. Notwithstanding anything set forth
          in clause (b) above to the contrary, each Lender may at any time
          grant, sell, or assign any portion of the Loan (each such interest so
          disposed of being herein called a "Participated Interest") to banks,
          insurance companies or other financial institutions (hereinafter
          called "Participants"), pursuant to such participation agreements,
          co-lender agreements, agreements and/or agency agreements into which
          such Lender and its respective Participants may enter; provided,
          however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
          remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible for
          the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrower shall continue to
          deal solely and directly with Administrative Agent (and, as
          applicable, such Lender) in connection with such Lender's rights and
          obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and
          (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which
          the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or
          waiver of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except to the
          extent such amendment or waiver would (A) extend the final scheduled
          maturity of any Note in which such Participant is participating, or
          reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon
          (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any
          post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal
          amount thereof, or increase the amount of the Participant's
          participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
          understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not
          constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an
          increase in the Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any
          Participant if the Participant's participation is not increased as a
          result thereof), (B) consent to the assignment or transfer by Borrower
          of any of its rights and Obligations under this Agreement or (C)
          release all or substantially all of the Collateral supporting the Loan
          in which such Participant is participating. In the case of any such
          participation, the Participant shall not have any rights under this
          Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (the Participant's rights
          against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set
          forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the
          Participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by Borrower
          hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such
          Participated Interest.

               (d) Assignments to Operation of Law or Pledges. Notwithstanding
          anything set forth in clause (b) above to the contrary, each Lender
          shall have the right, in addition to its rights under clauses (b) and
          (c) above, at any time and from time to time, to (i) assign an
          undivided interest in the Loan to any Affiliate of such Lender or to a
          successor entity by reason of any merger affecting Lender, or (ii)
          pledge or assign the same to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance
          with applicable law as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of
          the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating
          circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that (i) no
          Lender shall, as between Borrower and such Lender, be relieved of any
          of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and
          pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank be
          considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning
          Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

               (e) No Assignments to Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the
          contrary contained in this Section 9.07, in no event shall any Lender
          sell or assign any Transferred Interest to Borrower or any other
          Borrower Party, or any Affiliate of Borrower or any Borrower Party.

               (f) Cooperation with Syndication Efforts. Borrower acknowledges
          that Arranger intends to syndicate a portion of the Loan Commitments
          to one or more Lenders (the "Syndication") and in connection
          therewith, the Borrower will take all actions as Arranger,
          Administrative Agent and the Lenders may request to assist Arranger in
          its Syndication effort, provided however, that Borrower shall not be
          required to incur any costs or expenses in connection with such
          Syndication. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
          Borrower shall, at the request of Arranger: (i) assist Arranger and
          otherwise cooperate with Arranger in the preparation of information
          offering materials (which assistance may include reviewing and
          commenting on drafts of such information materials and drafting
          portions thereof); (ii) make representatives of the Borrower and
          Guarantor available to meet with prospective Lenders at bank meetings
          and property tours; (iii) use the Borrower's reasonable efforts to
          ensure that the Syndication benefits from the lending relations of the
          Borrower's principals; and (iv) provide Arranger with all information
          reasonably deemed necessary by it to complete the Syndication
          successfully. The Borrower agrees to take such further action, in
          connection with documents and, if required by Arrangers, Modifications
          to the Loan Documents of a non-material nature, as may be necessary or
          appropriate to effect such Syndication. The Borrower agrees that no
          other similar credit facilities or debts issued by the Borrower will
          be syndicated or privately placed which might, in the Arrangers'
          opinion, have a detrimental effect on the successful completion of the
          Syndication, and the Borrower agrees to notify Arranger immediately if
          any such issue is contemplated.

               (g) Provision of Information to Assignees and Participants. A
          Lender may furnish any information concerning Borrower, the Property,
          the Loan and Guarantor in the possession of such Lender from time to
          time to assignees, pledgees and participants (including prospective
          assignees, pledgees and participants), subject, however, to the party
          receiving such information confirming in writing that such party and
          such information is subject to the provisions of Section 9.23.


                                       68

     9.08 Survival. The obligations of Borrower under Sections 9.03, 9.04 and
9.12, and the obligations of the Lenders under Sections 8.05 and 8.11(e), shall
survive the repayment of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments
and, in the case of any Lender that may assign any interest under the Loan
Documents in accordance with the terms thereof including any Lender's interest
in its Commitment or Loans hereunder, shall survive the making of such
assignment, notwithstanding that such assigning Lender may cease to be a
"Lender" hereunder. In addition, each representation and warranty made, or
deemed to be made by a Request for Loan Advance, herein or pursuant hereto by
Borrower shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and no
Lender shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any Loan, any Default
that may arise by reason of such representation or warranty proving to have been
false or misleading, notwithstanding that such Lender or Administrative Agent
may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such representation
or warranty was false or misleading at the time such Loan was made.

     9.09 Multiple Copies. Each document to be delivered to Administrative Agent
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be delivered in such number of
copies as shall permit Administrative Agent to send copies thereof to each
Lender.

     9.10 Right of Set-off.

               (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
          of Default, each of the Lenders is, subject (as between the Lenders)
          to the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section 9.10, hereby
          authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to
          Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower) and to
          the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply any and all
          deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
          any time held, and other indebtedness at any time owing, by such
          Lender in any of its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, to
          or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any and all of
          the respective obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under
          the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or any
          other Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although such
          obligations may be contingent or unmatured and such deposits or
          indebtedness may be unmatured. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that
          the exercise by any Lender of offset, set-off, banker's lien, or
          similar rights against any deposit or other indebtedness of Borrower
          whether or not located in Ohio or any other state with certain laws
          restricting lenders from pursuing multiple collection methods, could
          result under such laws in significant impairment of the ability of all
          the Lenders to recover any further amounts in respect of the Loan.
          Therefore, each Lender agrees that no Lender shall exercise any such
          right of set-off, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets of
          Borrower (including all general or special, time or demand,
          provisional or other deposits and other indebtedness owing by such
          Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower) without the
          prior written consent of Administrative Agent and the Required
          Lenders.


                                       69
<PAGE>

               (b) Each Lender shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative
          Agent after any such set-off and application; provided that the
          failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
          set-off and application. The rights of the Lenders under this Section
          9.10 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
          rights of set-off) which the Lenders may have.

               (c) If an Event of Default has resulted in the Loans becoming due
          and payable prior to the stated maturity thereof, each Lender agrees
          that it shall turn over to Administrative Agent any payment (whether
          voluntary or involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff
          or otherwise) on account of the Loans held by it in excess of its
          ratable portion of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all
          the Lenders.

     9.11 Remedies of Borrower. If a claim or adjudication is made that
Administrative Agent, any of the Lenders, or their agents, acted unreasonably or
unreasonably delayed acting in any case where by law or under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, Administrative Agent, any Lender or any such agent, as
the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower
agrees that none of Administrative Agent, the Lenders or their agents shall be
liable for any monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited
to commencing an action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The
parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or their agents has acted reasonably shall be
determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. The foregoing shall not in
any way limit Borrower's rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender.

     9.12 Brokers. Borrower hereby represents to Administrative Agent and each
Lender that it has not dealt with any broker, underwriters, placement agent, or
finder in connection with the Transactions. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and
all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind in any way relating to
or arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of
Borrower in connection with the Transactions.

     9.13 Estoppel Certificates.

               (a) Borrower, within ten (10) days after Administrative Agent's
          request, shall furnish to Administrative Agent a written statement,
          duly acknowledged, certifying to Administrative Agent and each Lender
          and/or, subject to the terms of Section 9.07, any proposed assignee of
          any portion of the interests hereunder: (i) the amount of the
          Outstanding Principal Amount then owing under this Agreement and each
          of the Notes, (ii) the terms of payment and Stated Maturity Date of
          the Loans (or if earlier, the Maturity Date), (iii) the date to which
          interest has been paid under each of the Notes, (iv) whether any
          offsets or defenses exist against the repayment of the Loans and, if
          any are alleged to exist, a detailed description thereof, (v) the
          extent to which the Loan Documents have been Modified and (vi) such
          other information as Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.


                                       70
<PAGE>

               (b) Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after Borrower's
          reasonable request therefor, shall furnish to Borrower a written
          statement, duly acknowledged, certifying to any prospective permitted
          purchaser of an interest in Borrower or any prospective permitted
          lender to Borrower: (i) the amount of the Outstanding Principal
          Amount, (ii) the terms of payment and Stated Maturity Date of the
          Loans (or if earlier, the Maturity Date), (iii) the date to which
          interest has been paid under each of the Notes, (iv) whether, to the
          actual knowledge of the Person signing on behalf of Administrative
          Agent, there are any Defaults on the part of Borrower hereunder or
          under any of the other Loan Documents, and, if any are alleged to
          exist, a detailed description thereof and (v) the extent to which the
          Loan Documents have been Modified.

     9.14 Preferences. To the extent that Borrower makes a payment or payments
to Administrative Agent and/or any Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations
hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue
in full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received
by Administrative Agent or a Lender, as the case may be.

     9.15 Certain Waivers. Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives (a) promptness and diligence; (b) notice of any actions taken by
Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
any other agreement or instrument relating thereto except to the extent (i)
otherwise expressly provided herein or therein or (ii) Borrower is not, pursuant
to Applicable Law, permitted to waive the giving of notice, (c) all other
notices, demands and protests, and all other formalities of every kind in
connection with the enforcement of Borrower's obligations hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents, the omission of or delay in which, but for the
provisions of this Section 9.15, might constitute grounds for relieving Borrower
of any of its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, except to
the extent that Borrower is not, pursuant to Applicable Law, permitted to waive
the giving of notice, (d) any requirement that Administrative Agent or any
Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any lien on any collateral for the
Loans or exhaust any right or take any action against Borrower or any other
Person or against any collateral for the Loans, (e) any right or claim of right
to cause a marshalling of Borrower's assets and (f) all rights of subrogation or
contribution, whether arising by contract or operation of law or otherwise by
reason of payment by Borrower pursuant hereto or to the other Loan Documents.

     9.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
Documents constitute the entire agreement between Borrower, Administrative Agent
and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and all
understandings, oral representations and agreements heretofore or simultaneously
had among the parties are merged in, and are contained in, such documents and
instruments.

     9.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any
reason as to any Person or circumstance, such provision or provisions shall be
deemed severable from and shall in no way affect the enforceability and validity
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing
any such counterpart.

PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, ANY SECURITY

<PAGE>

THE NOTES , THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THE LOANS, ANY
AND EVERY RIGHT BORROWER MAY HAVE TO (A) INTERPOSE ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN,
OTHER THAN A COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM, AND (B) HAVE THE SAME CONSOLIDATED WITH
ANY OTHER OR SEPARATE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL PREVENT OR PROHIBIT BORROWER FROM
INSTITUTING OR MAINTAINING A SEPARATE ACTION AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE

     9.23 Confidentiality. Each of Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees
to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except
that Information that may be disclosed (a) to its Subsidiaries and Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder
or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially
the same as those of this Section 9.23, to (i) any assignee or pledgee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee or pledgee of or Participant in, any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of Borrower or
(h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as
a result of a breach of this Section 9.23 or (ii) becomes available to
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than Borrower. For the purposes of this Section 9.23, "Information" shall
mean all information received from or on behalf of Borrower relating to
Borrower, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective businesses, other
than any such information that is available to Administrative Agent or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower; provided that
in the case of information received from Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section 9.23 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do
so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
information subject to this Section 9.23 shall not include, and Administrative
Agent and each Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any
information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each
case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Administrative Agent or
such Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with
respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information
concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions as well as
other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the
document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of
the Loans and transactions contemplated hereby.


                                       73

     9.24 Usury Savings Clause. It is the intention of Borrower, Administrative
Agent and the Lenders to conform strictly to the usury and similar laws relating
to interest payable on loans from time to time in force, and all Loan Documents
between Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders, whether now existing or
hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly limited so
that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of maturity
hereof or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid in the aggregate
to the Lenders as interest (whether or not designated as interest, and including
any amount otherwise designated by or deemed to constitute interest by a court
of competent jurisdiction) hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or in any
other agreement given to secure the Loans, or in any other document evidencing,
securing or pertaining to the Loans, exceed the maximum amount (the "Maximum
Rate") permissible under Applicable Laws. If under any circumstances whatsoever
fulfillment of any provision hereof, of this Agreement or of the other Loan
Documents, at the time performance of such provisions shall be due, shall
involve exceeding the Maximum Rate, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be
fulfilled shall be reduced to the Maximum Rate. For purposes of calculating the
actual amount of interest paid and/or payable hereunder in respect of laws
pertaining to usury or such other laws, all sums paid or agreed to be paid to
the Lenders for the use, forbearance or detention of the Loans evidenced hereby,
outstanding from time to time shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
be amortized, pro-rated, allocated and spread from the date of disbursement of
the proceeds of the Notes until payment in full of all of such indebtedness, so
that the actual rate of interest on account of such Loans is uniform through the
term hereof. If under any circumstances any Lender shall ever receive an amount
which would exceed the Maximum Rate, such amount shall be deemed a payment in
reduction of the principal amount of the applicable Loans and shall be treated
as a voluntary prepayment under this Agreement and shall be so applied in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or if such excessive interest
exceeds the outstanding amount of the applicable Loans and any other
Obligations, the excess shall be deemed to have been a payment made by mistake
and shall be refunded to Borrower.

     9.25 Financing Statements. Borrower authorizes Administrative Agent to file
such financing statements (and any continuations statements with respect
thereto) under the Uniform Commercial Code as Administrative Agent may deem
necessary in order to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security
interest granted or to be granted to Administrative Agent pursuant to any of the
Loan Documents, in such jurisdictions as Administrative Agent may elect.
