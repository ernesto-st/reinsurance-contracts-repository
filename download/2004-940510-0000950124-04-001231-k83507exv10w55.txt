         within the meaning of Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction
         Exemption ("PTE") 95-60 (issued July 12, 1995) and there is no employee

         contracts held by or on behalf of such plan, exceed ten percent (10%)

         are expected to exceed 10% of the total assets of such account or
         accounts or trusts as of the date of such purchase (for the purpose of
         this clause (ii), all employee benefit plans maintained by the same

                  (iii)    all or part of such funds constitute assets of a bank
         collective investment fund maintained by it, and it has disclosed to
         each of the Collateral Trustee, the Issuer, the Owner Beneficiary and
         each Project Borrower, the names of such employee benefit plans whose
         assets in such collective investment fund exceed 10% of the total
         assets or are expected to exceed 10% of the total assets of such fund
         as of the date of such purchase (for the purpose of this clause (iii),
         all employee benefit plans maintained by the same employer or employee
         organization are deemed to be a single plan);

         more employee benefit plans, each of which has been identified to each
         of the Collateral Trustee, the Issuer, the Owner Beneficiary and each
         Project Borrower, in writing;

                  (v)      it is acquiring the Notes for the account of one or
         more pension funds, trust funds or agency accounts, each of which is a

                  (vi)     the source of funds is an "investment fund" managed
         by a "qualified professional asset manager" or "QPAM" (as defined in
         Part V of PTE 84-14, issued March 13, 1984), provided that no other
         party to the transactions described in this Participation Agreement and

         identified in writing pursuant to this clause (vi) or to negotiate the
         terms of said QPAM's management agreement on behalf of any such
         identified plans; or

                  (vii)    if it is other than an insurance company, all or a
         portion of such funds consists of funds which do not constitute "plan
         assets".

         (b)      Each Purchaser represents that it is an "accredited investor"
(as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended) acting for its own account (and not for the
account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others are also
"accredited investors"). Each Purchaser further represents that such Purchaser
is acquiring the Notes for the purpose of investment and not with a view to the
distribution thereof, and that such Purchaser has no present intention of
selling, negotiating or otherwise disposing of the Notes; it being understood,
however, that the disposition of such Purchaser's property shall at all times be
and remain within its control.

         Each Purchaser understands that the Notes have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or under
any state securities laws, and may not be resold in the absence of registration
unless such sale is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities laws.

accordance with this Section 8, the transferor shall be released, to the extent

transfer, including, without limitation, rights to indemnification under any
such document.

         Section 9.1 General Indemnity. The Guarantor and the Tenant, jointly
and severally, hereby assume liability for and agree to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless each Indemnified Person on an After Tax Basis from and against any
and all Claims, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an
Indemnified Person (other than to the extent such Claims arise from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or willful breach of such Indemnified Person) in
any way relating to or arising out of the execution, delivery, performance or
enforcement of this Participation Agreement, or any other Operative Document or
on or with respect to any Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation,
Claims in any way relating to or arising out of (a) the financing or
refinancing, purchase, acceptance, rejection, ownership, design, leasing,
subleasing, possession, use, operation, repair, modification, condition, sale,
return, repossession (whether by summary proceedings or otherwise), or any other
disposition of a Mortgaged Property or any part thereof; (b) any latent or other
defects in any Property whether or not discoverable by any Indemnified Person or
the Tenant; (c) the Operative Agreements, or any transaction contemplated
thereby; (d) any breach by the Guarantor or the Tenant of any of their
representations or warranties under the Operative Agreements or failure by the
Guarantor or the Tenant to perform or observe any covenant or agreement to be
performed by them under any of the Operative Agreements; and (e) personal
injury, death or property damage, including Claims based on strict liability in
tort; but excluding (i) Claims (except Claims against the Trust Company
(including claims arising from Taxes or other impositions set forth in clause
(iii) of the exclusions to the definition of "Impositions" set forth in Article
VI)) to the extent such Claims arise solely out of events occurring after the
expiration of the terms of all Leases and after the Tenant's discharge of all
its obligations under the Operative Agreements or (ii) any Taxes (disregarding
with respect to the Trust Company the exclusions set forth in clause (v), to the
extent attributable to action taken or not taken by the Issuer at the direction
of the Owner Beneficiary or the Collateral Trustee, and clause (ix) of the
exclusions to the definition of Impositions set forth in Article VI) including
any Claim (or any portion of a Claim) made upon an Indemnified Person by a third
party that at its origin is based upon a Tax (other than amounts necessary to
make any payments hereunder on an After Tax Basis, where the Tenant is otherwise
specifically required to make such payments on an After Tax Basis). The
Guarantor and the Tenant shall be entitled to control, and shall assume full
responsibility for the defense of any Claim; provided, however, that any
Indemnified Person named in such Claim, may each retain

separate counsel at the expense of the Tenant and the Guarantor; provided,
further, that such parties shall use reasonable efforts to share counsel to the
extent practicable and minimize the fees of counsel being reimbursed hereunder.
The Tenant, the Guarantor and each Indemnified Person agree to give each other
prompt written notice of any Claim hereby indemnified against but the giving of
any such notice by an Indemnified Person shall not be a condition to the
Tenant's and Guarantor's obligation under this Section 9.1, except to the extent
failure to give such notice prejudices the Tenant's or Guarantor's rights
hereunder. After an Indemnified Person has been fully indemnified for a Claim
pursuant to this Section 9.1, and so long as no default shall have occurred and
be continuing under any Lease, the Tenant and the Guarantor shall be subrogated
to any right of such Indemnified Person (except against another Indemnified
Person) with respect to such Claim.

         Section 9.2 General Tax Indemnity.

         (a) Indemnification. The Tenant shall pay and assume liability for, and
hereby agrees to indemnify, protect and defend each Mortgaged Property and all
Tax Indemnitees, and hold them harmless against, all Impositions on an After Tax
Basis. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to use good-faith efforts (but not including
increasing liability for Taxes not indemnifiable hereunder) to minimize the
amount of Taxes indemnifiable by the Tenant during any taxable year; provided
that this sentence shall not be construed to limit or impair any right of the
Issuer set forth in the Operative Agreements. Each Tax Indemnitee further agrees
to comply with recommendations made by the Tenant regarding techniques to
minimize Taxes indemnifiable hereunder; provided that (i) the Tenant agrees to
make payments to (or otherwise indemnify) such Tax Indemnitee against any cost
or expense arising from instituting the Tenant's recommendations and (ii) such
Tax Indemnitee determines in its sole discretion that such recommendations will
not have an adverse impact on such Tax Indemnitee.

         (b) Refunds. Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, if any Tax Indemnitee obtains a refund or a reduction in a
liability (but only if such reduction relates to a Tax not otherwise
indemnifiable hereunder and has not been taken into account in determining the
amount of a payment on an After Tax Basis) as a result of any Imposition paid or
reimbursed by the Tenant (in whole or in part), such Tax Indemnitee shall
promptly pay to the Tenant the lesser of (x) the amount of such refund or
reduction in liability and (y) the amount previously so paid or advances by the
Tenant, in each case net of reasonable expenses not already paid or reimbursed
by the Tenant.

         (c) Payments. (i) Subject to the terms of Section 9.2(g), the Tenant
shall pay or cause to be paid all Impositions directly to the taxing authorities
where feasible and otherwise to the Tax Indemnitee, as appropriate, and the
Tenant shall at its own expense, upon such Tax Indemnitee's reasonable request,
furnish to such Tax Indemnitee copies of official receipts or other satisfactory
proof evidencing such payment.

                  (ii) In the case of Impositions for which no contest is
         conducted pursuant to Section 9.2(g) and which the Tenant pays directly
         to the taxing authorities, the Tenant shall pay such Impositions prior
         to the latest time permitted by the relevant taxing authority for
         timely payment. In the case of Impositions for which the Tenant
         reimburses a Tax Indemnitee, the Tenant shall do so within twenty (20)
         days after receipt by the

         Tenant of demand by such Tax Indemnitee describing in reasonable detail
         the nature of the Imposition and the basis for the demand (including
         the computation of the amount payable), but in no event shall the
         Tenant be required to pay such reimbursement prior to thirty (30) days
         before the latest time permitted by the relevant taxing authority for
         timely payment. In the case of Impositions for which a contest is
         conducted pursuant to Section 9.2(g), the Tenant shall pay such
         Impositions or reimburse such Tax Indemnitee for such Impositions, to
         the extent not previously paid or reimbursed pursuant to Section
         9.2(a), prior to the latest time permitted by the relevant taxing
         authority for timely payment after conclusion of all contests under
         Section 9.2(g).

                  (iii) Impositions imposed with respect to a Mortgaged Property
         for a billing period during which a Lease expires or terminates with
         respect to such Mortgaged Property (unless the Tenant has exercised the
         purchase option set forth in the respective Lease with respect to such
         Mortgaged Property) shall be adjusted and prorated on a daily basis
         between the Tenant and the applicable Project Borrower, whether or not
         such Imposition is imposed before or after such expiration or
         termination and each party shall pay or reimburse the other for each
         party's pro rata share thereof.

                  (iv) At the Tenant's request, the amount of any
         indemnification payment by the Tenant pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall
         be verified and certified by an independent public accounting firm
         mutually acceptable to the Tenant and the Tax Indemnitee. The fees and
         expenses of such independent public accounting firm shall be paid by
         the Tenant unless such verification shall result in an adjustment in
         the Tenant's favor of 5% or more of the payment as computed by the Tax
         Indemnitee, in which case such fee shall be paid by the Tax Indemnitee.

         (d) Reports and Returns. The Tenant shall be responsible for preparing
and filing any real and personal property or ad valorem tax returns in respect
of each Mortgaged Property. In case any other report or tax return shall be
required to be made with respect to any obligations of the Tenant under or
arising out of Section 9.2(a) and of which the Tenant has knowledge or should
have knowledge, the Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall notify the
relevant Tax Indemnitee of such requirement and (except if such Tax Indemnitee
notifies the Tenant that such Person intends to file such report or return) (i)
to the extent required or permitted by and consistent with applicable laws, make
and file in its own name such return, statement or report; and (ii) in the case
of any other such return, statement or report required to be made in the name of
such Tax Indemnitee, advise such Tax Indemnitee of such fact and prepare such
return, statement or report for filing by such Tax Indemnitee or, where such
return, statement or report shall be required to reflect items in addition to
any obligations of the Tenant under or arising out of Section 9.2(a), provide
such Tax Indemnitee at the Tenant's expense with information sufficient to
permit such return, statement or report to be properly made with respect to any
obligations of the Tenant under or arising out of Section 9.2(a). Such Tax
Indemnitee shall, upon the Tenant's request and at the Tenant's expense, provide
any data maintained by such Tax Indemnitee (and not otherwise within the control
of the Tenant) with respect to each Mortgaged Property which the Tenant may
reasonably require to prepare any required tax returns or reports.

         (e) Income Inclusions. If as a result of the payment or reimbursement
by the Tenant of any costs and expenses of the Issuer, the Owner Beneficiary or
any of their respective

Affiliates incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Agreements, the Issuer, the Owner Beneficiary or any of their
respective Affiliates shall suffer a net increase in any federal, state or local
income tax liability, the Tenant shall indemnify the Issuer, the Owner
Beneficiary or any of their respective Affiliates (without duplication of any
indemnification required by Section 9.2(a)) on an After Tax Basis for the amount
of such increase. The calculation of any such net increase shall take into
account any current or future tax savings realized or reasonably expected to be
realized by the Issuer, the Owner Beneficiary or any of their respective
Affiliates, in respect thereof, as well as any interest, penalties and additions
to tax payable by the Issuer, the Owner Beneficiary or any of their respective
Affiliates.

         (f) Withholding Taxes. As between the Tenant and the Issuer, the Tenant
shall be responsible for, and the Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Issuer (without duplication of any indemnification required by Section 9.2(a))
on an After Tax Basis against, any obligation for United States withholding
taxes imposed in respect of the interest payable on the Project Loan Notes to
the extent, but only to the extent, the Issuer has actually paid funds to a
taxing authority with respect to such withholding taxes (and, if the Issuer
receives a demand for such payment from any taxing authority, the Tenant shall
discharge such demand on behalf of the Issuer).

         (g) Contests of Tax. (i) If a written claim is made against any Tax
Indemnitee or if any proceeding shall be commenced against such Tax Indemnitee
(including a written notice of such proceeding), for any Imposition, such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Tenant in writing and shall not take action
with respect to such claim or proceeding without the consent of the Tenant for
thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Tenant; provided,
however, that, in the case of any such claim or proceeding, if action shall be
required by law or regulation to be taken prior to the end of such 30-day
period, such Tax Indemnitee shall, in such notice to the Tenant, inform the
Tenant, and no action shall be taken with respect to such claim or proceeding
without the consent of the Tenant before the termination of such shorter period;
provided, further, that the failure of such Tax Indemnitee to give the notices
referred to this sentence shall not diminish the Tenant's obligation hereunder
except to the extent such failure precludes the Tenant from contesting all or
part of such claim.

                  (ii) If, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice
         from the Tax Indemnitee (or such shorter period as the Tax Indemnitee
         is required by law or regulation for the Tax Indemnitee to commence
         such contest), the Tenant shall request in writing that such Tax
         Indemnitee contest such Imposition, the Tax Indemnitee shall, at the
         expense of the Tenant, in good faith conduct and control such contest
         (including, without limitation, by pursuit of appeals) relating to the
         validity, applicability or amount of such Tax (provided, however, that
         (A) if such contest can be pursued independently from any other
         proceeding involving a tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee, the Tax
         Indemnitee, at the Tenant's request, shall allow the Tenant to conduct
         and control such contest and (B) in the case of any contest, the Tax
         Indemnitee may request the Tenant to conduct and control such contest)
         by, in the sole discretion of the Person conducting and controlling
         such contest, (1) resisting payment thereof, (2) not paying the same
         except under protest, if protest is necessary and proper, (3) if the
         payment be made, using reasonable efforts to obtain a refund thereof in
         appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings, or (4)

         taking such other action as is reasonably requested by the Tenant from
         time to time.

                  (iii) The party controlling any contest shall consult in good
         faith with the noncontrolling party and shall keep the non-controlling
         party reasonably informed as to the conduct of such contest; provided
         that all decisions ultimately shall be made in the sole discretion of
         the controlling party. The parties agree that a Tax Indemnitee may at
         any time decline to take further action with respect to the contest of
         any Imposition and may settle such contest if such Tax Indemnitee shall
         waive its rights to any indemnity from the Tenant that otherwise would
         be payable in respect of such claim (and any future claim by any taxing
         authority with respect to other taxable periods that are based, in
         whole or in part, upon the resolution of such claim) and shall pay to
         the Tenant any amount previously paid or advanced by the Tenant
         pursuant to this Section 9.2 by way of indemnification or advance for
         the payment of an Imposition.

                  (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
         9.2, a Tax Indemnitee shall not be required to take any action and the
         Tenant shall not be permitted to contest any Tax in its own name or
         that of the Tax Indemnitee unless (A) the Tenant shall have agreed to
         pay and shall pay to such Tax Indemnitee on demand and on an After Tax
         Basis all reasonable costs, losses and expenses that such Tax
         Indemnitee actually incurs in connection with contesting such Tax,
         including, without limitation, all reasonable legal, accounting and
         investigatory fees and disbursements, (B) in the case of a claim that
         must be pursued in the name of a Tax Indemnitee (or an Affiliate
         thereof), the amount of the potential indemnity (taking into account
         all similar or logically related claims that have been or could be
         raised in an audit involving such Tax Indemnitee) for which the Tenant
         may be liable to pay an indemnity under this Section 9.2 exceeds
         $1,000,000, (C) the Tax Indemnitee shall have reasonably determined
         that the action to be taken will not result in any material danger of
         sale, forfeiture or loss of any Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof
         or interest therein, will not interfere with the payment of rent under
         any Lease, and will not result in risk of criminal liability, (D) if
         such contest shall involve the payment of the Imposition prior to the
         contest, the Tenant shall provide to the Tax Indemnitee an
         interest-free advance in an amount equal to the Imposition that the Tax
         Indemnitee is required to pay (with no additional net after-tax cost to
         such Tax Indemnitee), (E) in the case of a claim that must be pursued
         in the name of a Tax Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof), the Tenant
         shall have provided to such Tax Indemnitee an opinion of independent
         tax counsel selected by the Tax Indemnitee and reasonably satisfactory
         to the Tenant stating that a reasonable basis exists to contest such
         claim (or, in the case of an appeal of an adverse determination, an
         opinion of such counsel to the effect that there is substantial
         authority for the position asserted in such appeal) and (F) no Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing. In no event shall a Tax
         Indemnitee be required to appeal an adverse judicial determination to
         the United State Supreme Court. In addition, a Tax Indemnitee shall not
         be required to contest any claim in its name (or that of an Affiliate)
         if the subject matter thereof shall be of a continuing nature and shall
         have previously been decided adversely by a court of competent
         jurisdiction pursuant to the contest provisions of this Section 9.2,
         unless there shall have been a change in law (or interpretation
         thereof) and the Tax Indemnitee shall have received, at the Tenant's
         expense, an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Tax
         Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to the Tenant stating that as a
         result of

         such change in law (or interpretation thereof), it is more likely than
         not that the Tax Indemnitee will prevail in such contest.

         Section 10.10 Confidential Information. For the purposes of this
Section 10.10, "Confidential Information" means information delivered to the
Collateral Trustee or Noteholder by or on behalf of the Guarantor or the Tenant
in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to
this Participation Agreement that is confidential or proprietary in nature and
that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when
received by the Collateral Trustee or any Noteholder as being confidential
information of the Guarantor or the Tenant, provided that such term does not
include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to the
Collateral Trustee or any Noteholder prior to the time of such disclosure, (b)
subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by the Collateral
Trustee or any Noteholder or any Person acting on behalf of the Collateral
Trustee or any Noteholder, (c) otherwise becomes known to the Collateral Trustee
or any Noteholder other than through disclosure by the Guarantor or the Tenant
or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to the Collateral Trustee or
any Noteholder under Section 4.1 that are otherwise publicly available.

         The Collateral Trustee and each Noteholder will maintain the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Collateral Trustee and each Noteholder in good faith to protect
confidential information of third parties delivered to the Collateral Trustee or
such Noteholder, provided that the Collateral Trustee and each Noteholder may
deliver or disclose Confidential Information to: (i) directors, trustees,
officers, employees, attorneys and affiliates of the Collateral Trustee or any
Noteholder (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the
administration of the investment represented by the Notes); (ii) financial
advisors and other professional advisors of the Collateral Trustee or any
Noteholder who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information in
accordance with the terms of this Section 10.10; (iii) with prior written notice
to the Guarantor, any Institutional Holder to which any Noteholder sells or
offers to sell a Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such
Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential
Information to be bound by

the provisions of this Section 10.10 and a copy of such written agreement has
been delivered to the Guarantor); (v) with prior written notice to the
Guarantor, any Person from which any Noteholder offers to purchase any security
of the Guarantor (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of
such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section
10.10 and a copy of such written agreement has been delivered to the Guarantor);
(vi) any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the
Collateral Trustee or any Noteholder but only to the extent such information is
expressly required to be disclosed by such regulatory authority (with written
notice of such disclosure given to the Guarantor promptly following such
disclosure); (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any
similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires
access to information about the investment portfolio of any Noteholder (with
written notice of such disclosure given to the Guarantor promptly following such
disclosure); or (viii) with prior written notice to the Guarantor, any other
Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary, but only (w) to
effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to the
Collateral Trustee or any Noteholder, (x) in response to any subpoena or other
legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which the Collateral
Trustee or any Noteholder is a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent the Collateral Trustee or any Noteholder may
reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate
in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under the
Notes and this Participation Agreement.

         Each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note or participation interest
therein, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the
benefits of this Section 10.10 as though it were a party to this Participation
Agreement. On reasonable request by the Guarantor or the Tenant in connection
with the delivery to any Noteholder of information required to be delivered to
such Noteholder under this Participation Agreement or requested by such
Noteholder (other than a Noteholder that is a party to this Participation
Agreement or its nominee), such Noteholder will enter into an agreement with the
Guarantor and the Tenant embodying the provisions of this Section 10.10.

         Section 10.11 Issuer Recourse. The parties hereto agree that all of the
statements, representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the
Issuer contained in this Participation Agreement are made and intended only for
the purpose of binding the Trust Estate (as defined in the Trust Agreement) and
establishing the existence of rights and remedies which can be exercised and
enforced against the Trust Estate. Therefore, anything contained in this
Participation Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no recourse shall be
had with respect to this Participation Agreement against the Trust Company or
against any institution or person which becomes a successor trustee or
co-trustee under the Trust Agreement or any officer, director, trustee, servant
or direct or indirect parent or controlling person or persons of any of them;
provided, however, that this Section 10.11 shall not be construed to prohibit

                              OF COUNSEL FOR ISSUER

         The closing opinions of Richards, Layton & Finger, special counsel to
the Issuer, called for by SECTION 2.13(a) of the Participation Agreement, shall
be dated the Closing Date and addressed to each Purchaser, shall be satisfactory
in form and substance to each Purchaser and shall be to the effect that:

         1. The Trust Company is a Delaware banking corporation, duly organized
and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has all necessary power and authority to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Indenture and act as the Owner Trustee and to enter into
and perform its obligations, as Trust Company or Owner Trustee, as the case may
be, under each of the other Operative Agreements to which the Trust Company or
the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, is a party.

         2. The execution, delivery and performance of each Operative Document
to which it is a party, either in its individual capacity or as the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, has been duly authorized by all necessary action on
its part and neither the execution and delivery thereof, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby, nor compliance by it with any of the
terms and provisions thereof (i) does or will require, to our knowledge, any
approval or consent of any trustee or holder of any of its indebtedness or
obligations, (ii) does or will contravene any current State of Delaware or
United States federal law, governmental rule or regulations relating to its
banking or trust powers, (iii) does or will contravene or result in any breach
of or constitute any default under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of its property under, its charter or by-laws, or, to our knowledge, without
independent investigation, any indenture, mortgage, chattel mortgage, deed of
trust, conditional sales contract, bank loan or credit agreement or other
agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its properties
may be bound or affected or (iv) does or will require any approval, consent,
filing (other than the filing of the financing statements in the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as described in paragraph 7 below),
registration or qualification with any governmental body of the State of
Delaware or any of the federal governmental body of the United States of America
governing the banking or trust powers of the Trust Company.

         3. The Indenture and each other Operative Document to which Trust
Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by Trust Company, and
the Indenture and each such other Operative Document to the extent entered into
by the Trust Company constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
enforceable against the Trust Company in accordance with the terms thereof.

         4. Each Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party have
been duly executed and delivered by the Owner Trustee and constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Owner Trustee, enforceable against the Owner
Trustee in accordance with the terms thereof.

                                    EXHIBIT B
                          (to Participation Agreement)
<PAGE>

         5.       To our knowledge, without independent investigation, no
investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or any governmental
body, federal, state or local, is pending or threatened by or against the Trust
Company or the Owner Trustee (a) with respect to any of the Operative Agreements
or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, or (b) which could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities,
operations, business or financial condition of the Trust Company or the Owner
Trustee.

         6.       Insofar as Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect in the State of Delaware (the "UCC") is applicable (without regard to
conflicts of laws principles), and assuming that the security interests of the
Collateral Trustee in the Collateral have been duly created and have attached
(and are of the type that may be perfected by the filing of a UCC financing
statement), no action is required to perfect such security interests in the
State of Delaware, except for the filing of a UCC financing statement in the
Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

         The opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger shall cover such other matters
of Delaware law relating to the collateral assignment of the Project Loans and
the issuance of the Notes and the transactions contemplated thereby as each
Purchaser may reasonably request. With respect to matters of fact on which such
opinions are based, such counsel shall be entitled to rely on appropriate
Certificates of public officials and other officers of the parties involved in
the transaction and the representations contained in the Participation
Agreement.

                        OF COUNSEL FOR COLLATERAL TRUSTEE

         The closing opinion of Ray, Quinney & Nebeker, counsel to the
Collateral Trustee, called for by SECTION 2.13(b) of the Participation
Agreement, shall be dated the Closing Date and addressed to each Purchaser and
shall be satisfactory in form and substance to each Purchaser and shall be to
the effect that:

         1.       The Collateral Trustee is a national banking association
validly existing under the laws of the United States and is duly qualified to
act as Collateral Trustee.

         2.       The Collateral Trustee has the requisite power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations under the
Participation Agreement and the Indenture and the other Operative Agreements to
which it is a party ( the "Collateral Trustee Documents") and has taken all
necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of
each of the Collateral Trustee Documents.

         3.       Each of the Collateral Trustee Documents has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Collateral Trustee and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation or contract of the Collateral Trustee
enforceable against the Collateral Trustee in accordance with its respective
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity
(regardless of whether the application of such principles is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

         4.       The Notes delivered on the date hereof have been duly
authenticated by the Collateral Trustee in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture.

         5.       No authorization, consent, approval, license, exemption of or
filing or registration with any court or governmental department, commission,
board, bureau, agency or instrumentality by the Collateral Trustee or any
affiliate thereof is necessary to the valid execution, delivery or performance
of the Collateral Trustee Documents.

         The opinion of Ray, Quinney & Nebeker shall cover such other matters
relating to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements as each
Purchaser may reasonably request. With respect to matters of fact on which such
opinion is based, such counsel shall be entitled to rely on appropriate
certificates of public officials and other officers of the parties involved in
the transaction.

                            OF COUNSEL FOR GUARANTOR
                                   AND TENANT

         The closing opinion of Dickinson Wright PLLC, special counsel to the
Guarantor and the Tenants, called for by SECTION 2.13(c) of the Participation
Agreement, shall be dated on the Closing Date and shall be satisfactory in form
and substance to each Purchaser and shall be to the effect that:

         1.       The Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of Michigan and has the corporate
power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the
Participation Agreement and each other Operative Document to which the Guarantor
is a party (the "Guarantor Documents").

         2.       Each of the Guarantor Documents has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and general
principles of equity (regardless of whether the application of such principles
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         3.       The execution, delivery and compliance by the Guarantor with
all of the provisions of the Guarantor Documents will not conflict with or
result in any breach of any of the provisions or constitute a default under or
result in the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance upon any of the
property of the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of the charter or the
by-laws of the Guarantor or any material agreement or other instrument to which
the Guarantor is a party or by which the Guarantor may be bound or any existing
law or governmental regulation relating to or having jurisdiction over the
Guarantor or its activities.

         4.       No approval, consent or withholding of objection on the part
of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental body,
federal or state, is necessary in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by the Guarantor of the Guarantor Documents.

         5.       The Tenant is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Colorado and has the corporate power and
authority to enter into and perform the Participation Agreement and each other
Operative Document to which the Tenant is a party (the "Tenant Documents").

         6.       The Tenant is duly licensed or qualified and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which any Mortgaged
Property is located.

         7.       Each of the Tenant Documents has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Tenant and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Tenant, enforceable

                                    EXHIBIT D
                          (to Participation Agreement)

<PAGE>

against the Tenant in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether the
application of such principles is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

         8.       The execution, delivery and compliance by the Tenant with all
of the provisions of the Tenant Documents will not conflict with or result in
any breach of any of the provisions of or constitute a default under or result
in the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance upon any of the
property of the Tenant pursuant to the provisions of the charter or the by-laws
of the Tenant or any material agreement or other instrument to which the Tenant
is a party or by which the Tenant may be bound or any existing law or
governmental regulation relating to or having jurisdiction over the Tenant or
its activities.

         9.       No approval, consent or withholding of objection on the part
of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental body,
federal or state, is necessary in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by the Tenant of the Tenant Documents.

         10.      The issuance and sale of the Project Loan Notes under the
circumstances contemplated by the Project Loan Agreements do not, under existing
law, require the registration of the Project Loan Notes under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

         11.      To the best of our knowledge after due inquiry, there is no
action, proceeding or governmental investigation pending or threatened that (i)
questions the validity of or challenges any of the Tenant Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) would have an adverse effect on the
benefits intended to be realized by the Issuer, the Collateral Trustee or the
Purchasers under any of the Tenant Documents, or (iii) could reasonably be
expected to have, either in any case or in the aggregate, a materially adverse
effect on the business, properties, assets, operations or financial condition of
Guarantor or the Tenant.

         12.      The issuance and delivery of the Notes under the circumstances
contemplated by the Participation Agreement and the Indenture do not, under
existing law, require the registration of the Notes under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended.

         13.      [NON-CONSOLIDATION OPINION CONCERNING PROJECT BORROWERS].

and shall be to the effect that:

         1.       The Project Borrower is duly formed, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation, and is duly
qualified to transact business as a limited liability company in the State of

         2.       Each of the Lease Documents has been duly authorized, executed

any of the Project Loan Documents.

         5.       The execution, delivery and performance by the Project
Borrower of each Lease Document and each Project Loan Document do not (i)
violate (A) the organizational documents pursuant to which the Project Borrower
is organized, or (B) to our knowledge, any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award applicable to the Project Borrower, (ii) result
in a breach or constitute a default under any indenture or loan or credit

obligations under any of the Lease Documents or any of the Project Loan
Documents, or the enforceability of the Project Borrower's obligations
thereunder.

                         DESCRIPTION OF CLOSING OPINION
                          OF EACH SPECIAL LOCAL COUNSEL
                            FOR THE PROJECT BORROWERS

         The closing opinion of various special local counsel to the Project
Borrowers, called for by SECTION 2.13(d) of the Participation Agreement, shall
be dated the Closing Date and shall be satisfactory in form and substance to
each Purchaser and shall be to the effect that:

         1.       The Project Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Project Borrower, enforceable against the Project
Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

         2.       The Lease Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Project Borrower, the Tenant, and the Guarantor (where
applicable), enforceable against each in accordance with their respective terms.

         3.       The Mortgage is in proper form satisfactory for recording in
the [insert recording office] (the "Recorder's Office"), and upon such
recordation shall create in favor of the Issuer a valid, enforceable and
perfected lien upon the real property interest described therein, as security
for the Project Loan and the Project Borrower's obligations under the Project
Loan Agreement. No other recordation or filing is required to create or preserve
the validity of such lien.

         4.       The Assignment of Leases and Rents is in proper form
satisfactory for recording in the Recorder's Office, and upon such recordation
shall create in favor of the Issuer a valid collateral or assignment of, or a
valid security interest in, the Project Borrower's interests described therein,
as security for the Project Loan and the Project Borrower's obligations under
the Project Loan Agreement.

         5.       The Memorandum of Lease is in proper form satisfactory for
recording in the Recorder's Office.

         6.       The Assignment of Mortgage is in proper form satisfactory for
recording in the Recorder's Office, and upon such recordation shall create in
favor of the Collateral Trustee a valid collateral assignment of, or a valid
security interest in, the Issuer's interests described therein.

         7.       The Reassignment of Leases and Rents is in proper form
satisfactory for recording in the Recorder's Office, and upon such recordation
shall create in favor of the Collateral Trustee a valid collateral assignment
of, or a valid security interest in, the Issuer's interests described therein.

         8.       The Mortgage creates a security interest in the portions of
the Mortgaged Property constituting fixtures, if any, and no financing or other
statements are required to be filed to perfect such security interest under the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State (the "UCC"), provided that the
Mortgage is properly recorded in the Recorder's Office.

                                   EXHIBIT E-2
                          (to Participation Agreement)

<PAGE>

         9.       To the extent that any property which secures the Project Loan
or which constitutes Collateral and in which a security interest can be granted
under the UCC (the "CODE COLLATERAL") is deemed located in the State for
purposes of the UCC, upon the recordation or filing of the Financing Statements
(as defined in the opinion) in the Filing Offices (as defined in the opinion),
the Issuer and the Collateral Trustee, as applicable, shall have a perfected
security interest in and perfected lien upon the Code Collateral to the extent
that perfection thereof is obtained by the filing of financing statements. To
continue the effectiveness of the Financing Statements, continuation statements
must be filed in the office in which the Financing Statements have been filed
within six months prior to the expiration of each fifth anniversary of the date
of filing of the Financing Statements. Any such continuation statement must be
signed by the secured party, who should identify the original statement by file
number and state that the original statement is still effective. No other
recordation or filing is required to preserve such interest in or lien upon the
Code Collateral.

         10.      The execution, delivery and performance by the Project
Borrower of the Lease Documents and the Project Loan Documents do not violate
any provision of law, rule or regulation of the State. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Tenant of the Lease Documents do not violate any
provision of law, rule or regulation of the State. The execution, delivery and
performance by the parties thereto of the Credit Documents do not violate any
provision of law, rule or regulation of the State.

         11.      Based solely on the interest specified in the Project Loan
Documents of 6.85% per annum on the outstanding but unpaid principal on the
Project Loan Note, the Project Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby do not violate the usury laws of the State.

         12.      No fees, taxes, or other charges, including, without
limitation, intangible documentary stamp, mortgage, transfer or recording taxes
or similar charges, are payable to the government of the State or to any
jurisdiction therein on account of the execution, delivery or ownership of the
Project Loan Documents, the Lease Documents or the Credit Documents, the
creation of the indebtedness evidenced or secured thereby, the creation of the
liens and security interests thereunder, or the filing, recording, or
registration of the Mortgage, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Assignment of
Leases and Rents, the Reassignment of Leases and Rents or the Financing
Statements, except for nominal filing or recording fees.

         13.      Neither the Issuer, the Collateral Trustee nor any of the
Noteholders is required to pay any tax, to be qualified to do business in the
State, to file any reports, or to comply with any statutory or regulatory rule
or requirement applicable only to financial institutions chartered or qualified
to do business in the State solely by reason of the execution, delivery or
acceptance of the Project Loan Documents, the Lease Documents or the Credit
Documents. The validity and enforceability of, and the exercise of any right or
remedy under or with respect to, the Project Loan Documents, the Lease Documents
and the Credit Documents will not be precluded by any failure to so qualify or
file.

                                     E-2-2

<PAGE>

         14.      The Mortgage and the Financing Statements conform to all
requirements of the laws of the State and the Mortgage contains remedial, waiver
and other provisions which will allow the Issuer and, upon recording of the
Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trustee to realize the practical benefits
intended to be conferred thereby. The Project Loan Documents and the Lease
Documents grant to the Issuer and, upon recording of the Credit Documents, to
the Collateral Trustee, remedies including, but not limited to, the rights to
(a) foreclose the Project Borrower's interests in the property securing the
Project Loan, (b) execute upon the Project Borrower's interests in the property
securing the Project Loan, (c) apply to a state court of the State for the
appointment of a receiver, (d) cite the Project Borrower's failure to pay taxes
as evidence of waste, and (e) collect the rents from the property securing the
Project Loan. Each of the remedies listed in the preceding sentence is a remedy
commonly sought by lenders whose loans are secured by real and personal property
in the State. Enforcement of the remedies provided in the Project Documents and
the Lease Documents with respect to the Project Borrower or its property will
not, except as expressly limited by the terms of the Project Documents and the
Lease Documents, deprive the Issuer and, upon recording of the Credit Documents,
the Collateral Trustee of their rights to seek a deficiency judgment or limit
the rights of the Issuer and the Collateral Trustee to foreclose on other
security or collateral securing the Project Loan.

         15.      In connection with the remedies provided in the Mortgage:

                  (a)      The exercise at any time and in any order of any
remedies available against the Code Collateral or any other Mortgaged Property
will not affect nor be affected by the exercise of any remedies relating to the
Mortgaged Property, unless the Project Loan has been paid in full and all
obligations under the Project Loan Documents have been performed in full.

                  (b)      The exercise of any remedies with respect to any
security or collateral located outside of the State securing the Project Loan
will not affect or limit the Issuer's or the Collateral Trustee's ability to
foreclose against, or exercise any other remedies with respect to the Mortgaged
Property, except to the extent that the fair value of such security or
collateral so sold or disposed of has been appropriately applied to the
repayment of the Project Loan or unless the Project Loan has been paid in full
and all obligations under the Project Loan Documents have been performed in
full.

                  (c)      There is no "one form of action" or similar law in
the State that would limit the Issuer or the Collateral Trustee or any other
secured party from choosing only one remedy to enforce its or their rights under
the Mortgage or the other Project Loan Documents.

         13.      The Issuer has collaterally assigned to the Collateral Trustee

              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COLLATERAL TRUSTEE

                                  OF GUARANTOR

and carry out the Operating Documents to which it is a party (the "Guarantor
Documents") and to perform obligations under each of the Guarantor Documents and
all such actions have been duly authorized by all necessary proceedings on its
part.

         3.       The Guarantor has duly and validly executed and delivered each
of the Guarantor Documents. Each such Guarantor Document constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally or
limiting the right of specific performance.

         4.       Neither the execution and delivery of the Guarantor Documents
nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated nor the compliance
with the terms and provisions thereof will (i) violate any provision of any
existing law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Guarantor or (ii)
conflict with, constitute a default under or result in any breach of (a) the
terms and conditions of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Guarantor or (b) any agreement or instrument or

whatsoever upon any property (now or hereafter acquired) of the Guarantor.

         5.       Except as disclosed in the Form 10Q for the quarter ending
July 23, 2000 (including Note 2 - Commitments and Contingencies to Financial
Statements) filed by Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Guarantor threatened against the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority which individually or in the

<PAGE>

consolidated interim financial statements dated July 28, 2002 (the "Interim
Statements") (the Annual Statements and the Interim Statements being
collectively referred to as the "Historical Statements"). The Historical
Statements were compiled from the books and records maintained by the
Guarantor's management, are correct and complete and fairly represent the
consolidated financial condition of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as of
their dates and the results of operations for the fiscal periods then ended and
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (except as

referenced in the foregoing paragraph (6) or in the notes thereto, other than as
incurred in the ordinary course of business after the date of such statements.
Except as disclosed therein or on the schedules thereto, there are no unrealized
or anticipated losses from any commitments of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of
the Guarantor which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of the Interim
Statements, no circumstances or events have occurred which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         8.       On the Closing Date, no Guarantor Documents or any
certificate, statement, financial or otherwise, agreement or other documents
furnished to the Purchasers in connection therewith, contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. On the Closing Date, there is no
fact known to the Guarantor which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and which has not been set forth in this Certificate or
in the certificates, Historical Statements, agreements or other documents
furnished in writing to the Purchasers prior to or on the Closing Date in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Guarantor Documents.

         9.       No consent, approval, exemption, order or authorization of, or
registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any other Person is
required by law or any agreement in connection with the execution and delivery
by the Guarantor of the Guarantor Documents, the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated and the compliance with the terms and
provisions thereof.

organizational documents or (ii) any agreement or instrument or order, writ,
judgment, injunction or decree to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties may be subject or bound where such violation individually or in
the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         11.      The Guarantor and its Subsidiaries (including the Tenant) are
in compliance in respects with all applicable laws in all jurisdictions in which
the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries is presently or will be doing business
except where the failure to do so individually or in the aggregate could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         12.      All contracts which are material to the business operations of
the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries (including the Tenant) are valid, binding and
enforceable upon the Guarantor and each such Subsidiary, as applicable, and each
of the other parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms, and
there is no default thereunder, to the Guarantor's knowledge, with respect to
parties other than the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries which could be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         13.      (a)      Except as otherwise disclosed in the September 2002
and October 2002 Phase I Environmental Assessments prepared by EMG for each
Mortgaged Property (the "Reports"), there are no circumstances at, on or under
any Mortgaged Property that constitute a material breach of or material
noncompliance with any of the Environmental Laws, and there are no past or
present Environmental Violations at, on or under any Mortgaged Property or, to
the knowledge of the Guarantor at, on or under adjacent property, that prevent
compliance with the Environmental Laws at any Mortgaged Property or that
otherwise would require that any removal, remediation or other corrective action
or cleanup be taken with respect to any Mortgaged Property.

                  (b)      No Mortgaged Property and no structures,
improvements, equipment, fixtures, activities or facilities thereon or
thereunder contain or use Hazardous Substances except in compliance with
Environmental Laws. Except as may otherwise be disclosed in the Reports, there
are no processes, facilities, operations, equipment or any other activities at,
on or under such property, or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor at, on or under
adjacent property, that have resulted or are currently resulting in the release
or threatened release of Hazardous Substances onto any Mortgaged Property,
except to the extent that such releases or threatened releases are not a breach
of or otherwise not a violation of the Environmental Laws.

                  (c)      There are no above ground storage tanks, underground
storage tanks or underground piping associated with such tanks, used for the
management of Hazardous Substances at, on or under any Mortgaged Property that
(i) do not have a full operational secondary containment system in place, and
(ii) are not otherwise in compliance with all Environmental Laws. Except as may
otherwise be disclosed in the Reports, there are no abandoned underground
storage tanks or underground piping associated with such tanks, previously used
for the management of Hazardous Substances at, on or under any Mortgaged
Property that have not either been closed in place in accordance with
Environmental Laws or removed in compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws and no contamination associated with the use of such tanks exists on such
property.

                  (d)      All material permits, licenses, authorizations, plans
and approvals necessary under the Environmental Laws for the conduct of business
by the Tenant on the Mortgaged Properties as presently conducted have been
obtained. All material notices, reports and other filings required by the
Environmental Laws to be submitted to a Governmental Authority which pertain to
past and current operations on the Mortgaged Properties have been submitted.

                  (e)      All present, and, based upon the Reports, to the best
of Guarantor's knowledge, all past on-site generation, storage, processing,
treatment, recycling, reclamation,

                                     H-1-3

<PAGE>

disposal or other use or management of Hazardous Substances at, on, or under any
Mortgaged Property and all off-site transportation, storage, processing,
treatment, recycling, reclamation, disposal or other use or management of
Hazardous Substances has been done in material compliance with the Environmental
Laws.

         14.      The representations and warranties of the Guarantor set forth
in each Guarantor Document are true and correct in all material respects. The
Guarantor is in compliance with its obligations under the Guarantor Documents
and there exists no Default or Event of Default by the Guarantor under any of
the Guarantor Documents.

         15.      The aggregate amount of Project Loan Debt Service (as defined
in the Project Loan Agreements) and payable as Basic Rent due under all Leases
for each calendar month occurring while the Notes are scheduled to be
outstanding equals the Monthly Amortization for such calendar month.

         16.      Neither the Guarantor nor any of its affiliates or partners,
members, directors or officers is or has been the subject of, or a defendant in:
(a) an enforcement action or prosecution (or settlement in lieu thereof) brought
by a governmental authority relating to a violation of securities, tax,
fiduciary or criminal laws, or (ii) a civil action (or settlement in lieu
thereof) brought by investors in a common investment vehicle for violation of
duties owed to the investors. Guarantor covenants that it will notify the
Collateral Trustee within five (5) days in the event any such action or
prosecution is initiated while the Notes are outstanding.

         17.      To the Guarantor's knowledge, no trustee or employee of the
State of Wisconsin Investment Board identified on the list attached hereto as
Annex I, either directly or indirectly (a) currently holds, except as may be
specifically set forth below, a personal interest in the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the "Entity") or the Entity's property or securities, or
(b) will, in connection with the Notes, receive (i) a personal interest in the
Entity or the Entity's property or securities, nor (ii) anything of substantial
economic value for his or her private benefit from the Entity or anyone acting
on its behalf. As to ownership of an interest in the Entity's publicly traded
securities, "knowledge" hereunder is based on an examination of record holders
of the Entity's securities and actual knowledge of the Guarantor.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                                    OF TENANT

         1.       Tenant is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Tenant
has the lawful power to own or lease its properties and to engage in the
business it presently conducts or proposes to conduct. Tenant is duly licensed
or qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which any Property is
located.

         2.       Tenant has full power to enter into, execute, deliver and
carry out the Operating Documents to which it is a party (the "Tenant
Documents") and to perform obligations under each of the Tenant Documents and
all such actions have been duly authorized by all necessary proceedings on its
part.

         3.       Tenant has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the
Tenant Documents. Each such Tenant Document constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Tenant enforceable against Tenant in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally or limiting the
right of specific performance.

         4.       Neither the execution and delivery of the Tenant Documents nor
the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated nor the compliance
with the terms and provisions thereof will (i) violate any provision of any
existing law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Tenant or (ii) conflict
with, constitute a default under or result in any breach of (a) the terms and
conditions of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational
documents of Tenant or (b) any agreement or instrument or order, writ, judgment,
injunction or decree to which Tenant is a party or by which Tenant or any of its
properties may be subject or bound, or (iii) result in the creation or
enforcement of any Lien, charge or encumbrance whatsoever upon any property (now
or hereafter acquired) of Tenant.

         5.       Except as disclosed in the Form 10Q for the quarter ending
July 23, 2000 (including Note 2 - Commitments and Contingencies to Financial
Statements) filed by Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of Tenant threatened against Tenant or any of its Subsidiaries before
any Governmental Authority which individually or in the aggregate could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Tenant nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any order, writ, injunction or any decree
of any Governmental Authority which individually or in the aggregate could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.       On the Closing Date, no Tenant Documents or any certificate,
statement, financial or otherwise, agreement or other documents furnished to the
Purchasers in connection therewith, contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. On the Closing Date, there is no fact known to Tenant which could

                                   EXHIBIT H-2

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and which has not been
set forth in this Certificate or in the certificates, Historical Statements,
agreements or other documents furnished in writing to the Purchasers prior to or
on the Closing Date in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Tenant Documents.

         7.       No consent, approval, exemption, order or authorization of, or
registration or filing with any Governmental Authority or any other Person is
required by law or any agreement in connection with the execution and delivery
by Tenant of the Tenant Documents, the consummation of the transactions therein
contemplated and the compliance with the terms and provisions thereof.

         8.       (a)      Except as otherwise disclosed in the September 2002
and October 2002 Phase I Environmental Assessments prepared by EMG for each
Mortgaged Property (the "Reports"), there are no circumstances at, on or under
any Mortgaged Property that constitute a material breach of or material
noncompliance with any of the Environmental Laws, and there are no past or
present Environmental Violations at, on or under any Mortgaged Property or, to

thereunder contain or use Hazardous Substances except in compliance with
Environmental Laws. Except as may otherwise be disclosed in the Reports, there

on or under such property, or, to the knowledge of Tenant at, on or under
adjacent property, that have resulted or are currently resulting in the release
or threatened release of Hazardous Substances onto any Mortgaged Property,
except to the extent that such releases or threatened releases are not a breach
of or otherwise not a violation of the Environmental Laws.

and approvals necessary under the Environmental Laws for the conduct of business
by Tenant on the Mortgaged Properties as presently conducted have been obtained.

                  (e)      All present, and, based upon the Reports, to the best
of Tenant's knowledge, all past on-site generation, storage, processing,

         11.      No portion of any Mortgaged Property is located in an area
identified as a special flood hazard area by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency or other applicable agency, or if any such Mortgaged Property is located
in an area identified as a special flood hazard area by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or other applicable agency, then flood insurance has been
obtained for such Mortgaged Property in accordance with Article XV of each Lease
and in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended.

         12.      Tenant has obtained insurance coverage for each Mortgaged
Property which meets the requirements of Article XV of each Lease and all of
