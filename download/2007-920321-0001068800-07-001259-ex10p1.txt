         Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such
                    -----
         L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower
                             ------

         During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be
         requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans
         without the consent of the Required Lenders.

                  (d) Notice of Interest Rate. The Administrative Agent shall

                                    (B) the expiry date of such requested

                  or the Administrative Agent may require.

                  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative
         Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has
         received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the
         Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative
         Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written
         notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or
         any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date
         of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one
         or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then

         be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
         L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for
         the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter
         into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in
         accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business
         practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit,
         each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
         irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C
         Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount
         equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender's Applicable
         Revolving Credit Percentage times the amount of such Letter of
                                     -----
         Credit.

                  (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter
         of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
         discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic
         extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of Credit");
                                         -------------------------------
         provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit
         --------
         the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each
         twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such
         Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof
         not later than a day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such
                                    -------------------------
         twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of
         Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the
         Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C
         Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of
         Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have
         authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the
         extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not
         later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
         that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the
         L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would
         have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in
         its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of
         the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or
                                                   ---------------
         otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone
         or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before
         the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that
         the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2)
         from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or
         more of the applicable

         each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

                  (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
         any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
         thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also
         deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and
         complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

                      ------------------------------------------------------

                           (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter
                  of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of
                  Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 12:00 Noon on
                  the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of
                  Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the Borrower shall
                                              ----------
                  reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in
                  an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the
                  Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time,
                  the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
                  Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the
                  unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the
                                             -------------------
                  amount of such Revolving Credit Lender's Applicable
                  Revolving Credit Percentage thereof. In such event, the
                  Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving
                  Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the
                  Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount,
                  without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
                  Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans,

                  reduction in the stated amount of such Letter of Credit
                  resulting from such drawing thereunder) and the conditions
                  set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan
                               ------------
                  Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the
                  Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may
                                                        ------------------
                  be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;
                  provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation
                  --------
                  shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of
                  such notice.

                           (ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any
                  notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available
                                     ------------------

                  Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount
                  equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the
                  Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business
                  Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
                  whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
                                                          -------

                  Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative
                  Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

                  is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of

                           (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other
                  document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be
                  forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect
                  or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
                  respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or
                  otherwise of any document required in order to make a
                  drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                           (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such
                  Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
                  certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of
                  such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer
                  under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
                  trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for
                  the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
                  representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any
                  transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising
                  in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
                  Law;

                           (v) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
                  collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or
                  consent to the departure from any Guarantee, or all or any
                  of the Obligations of the Borrower in respect of any Letter
                  of Credit; or

                           (vi) any other circumstance or happening
                  whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
                  including any other circumstance that might otherwise
                  constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
                  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

         The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit
and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any
claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity,
the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer within one Business Day
after the Borrower's receipt of such Letter of Credit or amendment. The
Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against
the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as
aforesaid.

                  (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree
                      ------------------
         that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer
         shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than
         any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the
         Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or
         accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person
         executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer,
         the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor
         any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be
         liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in
         connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the
         Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Revolving Lenders, as
         applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
         negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,
         effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
         instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The
         Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
         beneficiary or

                                      48

         transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided,
                                                                     --------
         however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not,
         -------
         preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may
         have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
         agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of
         their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant
         or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any
         of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section
                                                                -------
         2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
         -------  --------  -------
         contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the
         L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the
         extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
         consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which
         the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful
         misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to
         pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
         beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying
         with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. In
         furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer
         may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order,
         without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
         notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not
         be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
         transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
         Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
         thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
         ineffective for any reason.

                  (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative
                      ---------------
         Agent, if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C
         Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall
         immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
         Obligations. Sections 2.05 and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional
                      -------------     -------
         requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of
         this Section 2.03, Section 2.05 and Section 8.02(c), "Cash
              ------------  ------------     ---------------   ----
         Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the
         -------------
         Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the
         Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit
         account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which
         documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of
         such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to
         the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the
         Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and
         all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash
         Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, interest bearing deposit
         accounts at Bank of America. If at any time the Administrative Agent
         determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any
         right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or
         that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate
         Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Borrower will,
         forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the
         Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited as Cash
         Collateral, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate
         Outstanding Amount over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then
         held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to
         be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of
         any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash
         Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted
         under applicable Laws, to reimburse the L/C Issuer.

                  (h) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
                      ----------------------------
         agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is
         issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter
         of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby
         Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and
         Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the
         International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply
         to each commercial Letter of Credit.

                  (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
                      ---------------------
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender
         in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage a
         Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter of
                                    --------------------
         Credit equal to the product of the Applicable Rate times the daily
                                                            -----
         amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For
         purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under
         any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
         determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees
                                       ------------
         shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day of each
         January, April, July and October, commencing October 2, 2006, on the
         Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii)
         computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in
         the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to
         be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and
         multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during
         such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the
         Required Revolving Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all
         Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.

                  (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges
                      ---------------------------------------------------
         Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
         ---------------------
         Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (i) with respect to each
         commercial Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum specified in the
         Bank of America Fee Letter, computed on the amount of such commercial
         Letter of Credit, and payable upon the issuance thereof, (ii) with
         respect to any amendment of a commercial Letter of Credit increasing
         the amount of such Letter of Credit, at a rate separately agreed
         between the Borrower and the L/C Issuer, computed on the amount of
         such increase, and payable upon the effectiveness of such amendment,
         and (iii) with respect to each standby Letter of Credit, at the rate
         per annum specified in the Bank of America Fee Letter, computed on
         the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on
         a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and
         payable on the first Business Day of each January, April, July and
         October in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or
         portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with
         October 2, 2006, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
         thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount
         available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such
         Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06.
                                                                 ------------
         In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for
         its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and
         other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the
         L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in
         effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and

                                      50

         charges are due and payable within 10 Business Days after demand and
         are nonrefundable.

                  (k) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any
                      ------------------------------
         conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer
         Document, the terms hereof shall control.

                  (l) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.
                      -----------------------------------------
         Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding
         hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account
         of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
         L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of
         Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters
         of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of
         the Borrower, and that the Borrower's business derives substantial
         benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.

         2.04 SWING LINE LOANS.
              ----------------

                  (a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set
                      --------------
         forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees, in reliance upon the
         agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, to
                                                           ------------
         make loans (each such loan, a "Swing Line Loan") to the Borrower from
                                        ---------------
         time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an
         aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of
         the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing
         Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Revolving Credit
         Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and
         L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed
         the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment; provided,
                                                                  --------
         however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the
         -------
         Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving
         Credit Facility at such time, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding
         Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender
         at such time, plus such Revolving Credit Lender's Applicable
                       ----
         Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C
         Obligations at such time, plus such Revolving Credit Lender's
                                   ----
         Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of
         all Swing Line Loans at such time shall not exceed such Lender's
         Revolving Credit Commitment and provided further that the Borrower
                                         -------- -------
         shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
         outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject
         to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow
         under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow
                    ------------               ------------
         under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest
                    ------------
         only at a rate based on the Base Rate. Immediately upon the making of
         a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to,
         and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from
         the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in
         an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender's
         Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage times the amount of such Swing
                                                -----
         Line Loan.

                  (b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be
                      --------------------
         made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender
         and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each
         such notice must be received by the

         Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00
         p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the
         amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $500,000, and (ii)
         the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each
         such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the
         Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing
         Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
         Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line
         Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line
         Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
         writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing
         Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the
         Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents
         thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by
         telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at
         the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the
         date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing
         Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the
         limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section
                                                                       -------
         2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions
         -------     ---
         specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the
                      ----------
         terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later
         than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line
         Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the
         Borrower at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower on
         the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.

                  (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.
                      -------------------------------

                           (i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole
                  and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the
                  Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line
                  Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving
                  Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to
                  such Lender's Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the
                  amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request
                  shall be made in writing (which written request shall be
                  deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in
                  accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without
                                                      ------------
                  regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for
                  the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the
                  unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and the
                  conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender
                                          ------------
                  shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable

         deposited in a separate Prepayment Account (as defined below) for

         outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans have been prepaid or until all the
         allocable cash on deposit in the Prepayment Account has been
         exhausted. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Prepayment

         subjected to a first priority perfected security interest in favor of
         the Administrative Agent and (iii) if any Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing, the selection of such Cash Equivalents
         shall be in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent. The
         Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent for any losses
         relating to such investments in Cash Equivalents so that the amount
         available to prepay Eurodollar Rate Loans on the last day of the
         applicable Interest Periods is not less than the amount that would
         have been available had no investments been made pursuant hereto.
         Other than any interest or profits earned on such investments, the
         Prepayment Accounts shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
         any, on the investments in any Prepayment Account shall accumulate in
         such Prepayment Account and, so long as no Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing, shall be paid by the Administrative Agent
         to the Borrower at the end of each fiscal quarter. If the maturity of
         the Loans has been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.02, the

         such "Net Proceeds" the Borrower would otherwise be required to offer

         Application Date an amount equal to such "Net Proceeds" to be applied

                           (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not
                  paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace

                  the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
                  applicable Laws.

                           (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any

                      --------------
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender
         in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage, a
         commitment fee equal to the product of the Applicable Commitment Fee
         Percentage times the actual daily amount by which the Revolving
                    -----

                                      61

<PAGE>

         Credit Facility exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of
         Revolving Credit Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
         Obligations. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the
         Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more
         of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and
                              ----------
         payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each
         January, April, July and October, commencing with October 2, 2006,
         and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee
         shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change
         in the Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage during any quarter, the
         actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the
         Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage separately for each period
         during such quarter that such Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage
         was in effect.

                  (b) Ticking Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
                      -----------
         Administrative Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Delayed-Draw
         Lenders, a ticking fee (the "Ticking Fee") in an amount equal to
                                      -----------
         0.50% per annum on the aggregate amount of the Delayed-Draw
         Commitment (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
         elapsed over a 360-day year), which Ticking Fee shall accrue from the
         First Amendment Effective Date to, and shall be payable in full to
         the Administrative Agent on the Delayed-Draw Commitment Termination
         Date, regardless of whether any Delayed-Draw Funding Date actually
         occurs; provided that if any Delayed-Draw Funding Date shall occur,
                 --------
         the accrued Ticking Fee shall be payable at such time in respect of
         the aggregate amount of the Delayed-Draw Commitment funded on such
         Delayed-Draw Funding Date. It is acknowledged and agreed that upon
         payment of the accrued portion of the Ticking Fee on any Delayed-Draw
         Funding Date, no further payment obligation in respect of the Ticking
         Fee relating to the portion of the Delayed-Draw Commitment then
         funded shall continue to exist.

                  (c) Other Fees.
                      ----------

                           (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Lead Arrangers
                  and the Administrative Agent for their own respective
                  accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in
                  the Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid
                  and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

                           (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such
                  fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in
                  the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall
                  be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for
                  any reason whatsoever.

         2.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.
              --------------------------------

         All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate
is determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of
a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All
other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a
360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest,
as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).
Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and
shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion

                                      62

thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that
                                                                --------
any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the
---------------
Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         2.11 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.
              ----------------

                  (a) Accounts and Records of Credit Extensions. The Credit
                      -----------------------------------------
         Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
         accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
         Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts
         or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender
         shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit
         Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and
         payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so
         shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
         Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
         Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
         records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
         Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and
         records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
         manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the
         Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
         Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall
         evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records.
         Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the
         date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and
         payments with respect thereto.

                  (b) Accounts and Records of Purchases and Sales. In addition
                      -------------------------------------------
         to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each
                                                    ---------------
         Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with
         its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and
         sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing
         Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
         records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and
         records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and
         records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
         manifest error.

         2.12 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK.
              ---------------------------------------------------

                  (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall
                      -------
         be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense,
         recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
         all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the
         Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to
         which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in
         Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m.
         on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly
         distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the
         relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of
         such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such
         Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
         Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
         Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to

                                      63


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a
         day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
         following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected
         in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

                  (b) Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.
                      ----------------------------------------

                           (i) Funding by Lenders. Unless the Administrative
                               ------------------
                  Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
                  proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or,
                  in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to
                  12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender
                  will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
                  Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent
                  may assume that such Lender has made such share available on
                  such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case
                                               ------------
                  of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made
                  such share available in accordance with and at the time
                  required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such
                              -------------
                  assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
                  amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
                  share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
                  Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the
                  Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
                  forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately
                  available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and
                  including the date such amount is made available to the
                  Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
                  Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be
                  made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate
                  and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
                  accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
                  compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar
                  fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in
                  connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a
                  payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate
                  applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such
                  Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent
                  for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative
                  Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of
                  such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such
                  Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the
                  Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall
                  constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
                  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to
                  any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall
                  have failed to make such payment to the Administrative
                  Agent.

                           (ii) Payments by Borrower. Unless the
                                --------------------
                  Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
                  Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due to
                  the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or
                  the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make
                  such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
                  Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
                  herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
                  distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as
                  the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
                  Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the
                  Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be,
                  severally agrees to

                                      64


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

                  repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
                  amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in
                  immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each
                  day from and including the date such amount is distributed
                  to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
                  Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds
                  Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
                  accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
                  compensation.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower
with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.

                  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender
                      ---------------------------------------
         makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be
         made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
         Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by
         ----------
         the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
         Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived
                                       ----------
         in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall
         return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
         such Lender, without interest.

                  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the
                      ------------------------------
         Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Credit Loans, to
         fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to
         make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint.
                                   ----------------
         The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such
         participation or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any
                                                    ----------------
         date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its
         corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall
         be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
         Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under
         Section 11.04(c).
         ----------------

                  (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
                      --------------
         obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any
         particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any
         Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in
         any particular place or manner.

                  (f) Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds
                      ------------------

its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate
amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments
on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to
all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained
by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the
Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but
not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount
of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and
payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such
time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities

Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then,
in each case under (a) or (b) above, the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (B)
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and
subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other
Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the
Facilities then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and
payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that:

                  (1) if any such participations or subparticipations are
         purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto
         is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be
         rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
         recovery, without interest; and

                  (2) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to
         apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
         accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (B) any
         payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of
         or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations
         in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or
         participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as
         to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).

         Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such
Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan
Party in the amount of such participation.

         Borrower, Holdings or the Administrative Agent to determine whether
         or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information
         reporting requirements.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower or Holdings,
as the case may be, is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any
Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, Holdings and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or
prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower,
Holdings or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is
legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

                           (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
                  Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an
                  income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

                           (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
                  Service Form W-8ECI,

                           (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the
                  benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
                  section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate to the effect
                  that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a "bank" within the
                  meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a "10
                  percent shareholder" of the Borrower or Holdings within the
                  meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a
                  "controlled foreign corporation" described in section
                  881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) duly completed copies of
                  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or

                           (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as
                  a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United
                  States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with
                  such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
                  applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the
                  withholding or deduction required to be made.

                  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative
                      ----------------------------
         Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole
         discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes
         as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or Holdings, as
         the case may be, or with respect to which the Borrower or Holdings,
         as the case may be, has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
         Section, it shall pay to the Borrower or Holdings, as the case may
         be, an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
         indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower
         or Holdings under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other
         Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
         of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
         case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by
         the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),
         provided that the Borrower or Holdings, as the case may be, upon the
         --------
         request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
         agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or Holdings
         (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
          ----
         relevant Governmental Authority), as the case may be, to the
         Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer if the

                                      71


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to
         repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection
         shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any
         Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any
         other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential)
         to the Borrower, Holdings or any other Person.

         3.02 ILLEGALITY.
              ----------

         If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that
any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans,
or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or
any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority
of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the
London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the
Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to
make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower
shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to
Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if
such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to
such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain
such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or
converted.

         3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES.
              ----------------------------

         If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection
with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation
thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London
interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of
such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such
Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each
Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon
the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of
such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will
be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

         3.04 INCREASED COSTS; RESERVES ON EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.
              --------------------------------------------------

                  (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
                      -------------------------

                           (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
                  special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or
                  similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
                  the account of, or credit extended or participated in by,
                  any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by
                  Section 3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer;
                  ----------------

                           (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any
                  tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement,
                  any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of
                  Credit or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the
                  basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C
                  Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or
                  Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of,
                                         ------------
                  or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by
                  such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or

                           (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the
                  London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense
                  affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by
                  such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation
                  therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining
its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender
or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any
Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable
by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer
                      --------------------
         determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C
         Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the
         L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements
         has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
         Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such
         Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a
         consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the
         Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such
         Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level
         below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or
         the L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such
         Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C
         Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C
         Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from
         time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
         as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will

                                      73


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C
         Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a
                      ------------------------------
         Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts
         necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding
         company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of
         this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent
         manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
         as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate
         within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any
                      -----------------
         Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the
         foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
         such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation,
         provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
         --------
         Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
         Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more
         than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
         as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving
         rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or
         the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except
         that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
         reductions is retroactive, then the 120 day period referred to above
         shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
         thereof).

                  (e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall
                      ---------------------------------
         pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to
         maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
         or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
         "Eurocurrency liabilities," as defined in Regulation D of the FRB),
         additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar
         Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to
         such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith,
         which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and
         payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
         provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days' prior
         --------
         notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional
         interest from such Lender together with a schedule containing a
         reasonably detailed explanation and calculation thereof; and
         provided, further, that such additional interest shall not exceed an
         --------  -------
         amount based upon an interest rate per annum equal to the remainder
         obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest
         Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan from (ii) the rate obtained by
         dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the
         Eurodollar Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest
         Period. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the
         relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due
         and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.

         3.05 COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES.
              -----------------------

         Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and
hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a
result of:

                                      74


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

                  (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of
         any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
         Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the
         failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or
         convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount
         notified by the Borrower; or

                  (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other
         than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a
         request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.13;
                                             -------------

excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any loss or expense
arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to
maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which
such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary
administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders
under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each
           ------------
Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a
matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market
for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

         3.06 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.
              ----------------------------------------------

                  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender
                      -----------------------------------------
         requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required
                                     ------------
         to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
         Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or
                                                             ------------
         if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such
                                                  ------------
         Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending
         Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
         rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
         or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation
         or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
         to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or
            ------------    ----
         eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as
                                                       ------------
         applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to
         any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not, in the good faith
         judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to
         such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs
         and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
         designation or assignment.

                  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests
                      ----------------------
         compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to
                            ------------
         pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority
         for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrower
                                                   ------------
         may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.13.

                  (c) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.09, neither
                                                       -------------
         any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is undertaking, and has
         not completed, either individually or together with other potentially
         responsible parties, any investigation or assessment or remedial or
         response action relating to any actual or threatened release,
         discharge or disposal of Hazardous Materials at any site, location or
         operation, either voluntarily or pursuant to the order of any

         The properties of the Borrower, Holdings and its other Subsidiaries
are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies having an
A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of at least A (other than the insurance
with Arch Insurance Company which shall have an A.M. Best Financial Strength
Rating of at least A-) which are not Affiliates of the Borrower, in such
amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily
carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar
properties in localities where the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary
operates.

         5.11 TAXES.
              -----

         The Borrower, Holdings and its other Subsidiaries have filed all

reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP. To the best knowledge
of Holdings and the Borrower, there is no proposed tax assessment against the
Borrower, Holdings or any other Subsidiary that would, if made, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither any Loan Party nor any Subsidiary thereof is
party to any tax sharing agreement. The Borrower, Holdings and its other
Subsidiaries had, as of December 31, 2006, net operating loss carry forwards

         5.12 ERISA COMPLIANCE.

                      --------------------
         material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code
         and other Federal or state Laws. Each Plan that is intended to
         qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
         determination letter from the IRS (or is a prototype plan that is the
         subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS) or an application
         for such a letter is currently being processed by the IRS with
         respect thereto and, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, nothing
         has occurred which would prevent, or cause the loss of, such
         qualification. The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made all
         required contributions to each Pension Plan, and no application for a
         funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period pursuant to
         Section 412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Pension
         Plan.

                  (b) Pending Claims. There are no pending or, to the best
                      --------------
         knowledge of the Borrower, threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or
         action by any Governmental Authority, with respect to any Plan that
         could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There
         has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the fiduciary
         responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted or
         could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) No ERISA or Unfunded Pension Liability. (i) No ERISA
                      --------------------------------------
         Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) no
         Pension Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability that could reasonably
         be expected to result in a liability in an amount in excess of
         $50,000,000; and (iii) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate
         has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any liability (A) under
         Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan (other than
         premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA), (B)
         under Section 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer
         Plan (and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice
         under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability), or (C)
         as a result of a transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or
         4212(c) of ERISA, which liability described in the foregoing clauses
         (A) through (C), individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
         be expected to exceed $50,000,000.

         purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock.

                  (b) Investment Company Act. None of the Borrower, any Person

Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Loan Party is subject, and
all other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No report,
financial statement, certificate or other information furnished (whether in
writing or orally) by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any
other Loan Document (in each case as modified or supplemented by other

misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were

the Borrower, an environmental site assessment report for any of such
properties, prepared by an environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable

in connection with any Hazardous Materials on such properties; without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent
determines at any time that a material risk exists that any such report will
not be provided within the time referred to above, the Administrative Agent
may retain an environmental consulting firm to prepare such report at the
expense of the Borrower, and the Borrower hereby grants and agrees to cause
any Subsidiary that owns any property described in such request to grant at

Subsidiaries is entitled to make under such Material Contract, and cause each
of its Subsidiaries to do so, except, in any case, where the failure to do so,

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any
electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other

otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also
may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by

for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to
the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms
must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making
of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice
of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         9.05 DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective
Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any
such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any
such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as
activities as Administrative Agent.

         9.06 RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.
              -----------------------------------

resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of
any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower (and, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, with the prior written consent of the Borrower,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a
successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative
Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent
may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that
                                                                 --------
if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no
qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the
case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent

                                     124


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents,
the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral
security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and
(b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to
or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender
and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the
acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of
its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not
already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees
payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same
as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of
this Article and Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of
                 -------------
such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective
Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative
Agent.

         Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant
to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing
Line Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line
Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor L/C
Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of
Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other
arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the
obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.

         9.07 NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.
              ------------------------------------------------------

         Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

              ---------------------------------------------

         In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law
or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the
Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C
Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration
or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have
made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses,

counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections

2.09 and 11.04.

Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf
of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any
Lender or the L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in

         10.01 GUARANTY.
               --------

         Holdings hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a
guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of
collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required
prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times
thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal,
interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise,
of the Borrower to the Secured Parties, arising hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings
and other modifications thereof and all costs, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses incurred by the Secured Parties in connection with the collection or
enforcement thereof). The Administrative Agent's books and records showing the
amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or
proceeding, and shall be binding upon Holdings, and conclusive for the purpose
of establishing the amount of the Obligations, absent manifest error. This
Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing
any

                                     127

<PAGE>

Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection,
non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or
circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a
defense to the obligations of Holdings under this Guaranty, and Holdings
hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in
any way relating to any or all of the foregoing, whether arising as a result
of any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any
term of the Obligations.

         10.02 RIGHTS OF LENDERS.
               -----------------

         Holdings consents and agrees that the Secured Parties may, at any
time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting
the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend,
renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold,
exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose
of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations; (c) apply
such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion
may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or
other guarantors of any of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Holdings consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any
action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of Holdings
under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a
discharge of Holdings.

         10.03 CERTAIN WAIVERS.
               ---------------

         Holdings waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability
or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from
any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Secured Party) of
the liability of the Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that
Holdings' obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the
Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting Holdings'
liability hereunder; (d) subject to Section 10.05, any right to proceed
                                    -------------
against the Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the
Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Secured Party
whatsoever; (e) subject to Section 10.05, any benefit of and any right to
                ------------------------
participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Secured Party; and
(f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or
benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the
liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Holdings expressly waives
all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or
performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or
nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of
acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new
or additional Obligations. Holdings waives any rights and defenses that are or
may become available to Holdings by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive,
and Sections 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code. As provided below, this
Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York. The foregoing waivers and the provisions hereinafter
set forth in this Guaranty which pertain to California law are included solely
out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of
the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to
this Guaranty or the Obligations.

         10.04 OBLIGATIONS INDEPENDENT.
               -----------------------

         The obligations of Holdings hereunder are those of primary obligor,
and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the
obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought
against Holdings to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any
other person or entity is joined as a party.

         10.05 SUBROGATION.
               -----------

         Holdings shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution,
indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it
makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable
under this Guaranty have been paid in full in cash and performed in full and
the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated. If any amounts are paid to
Holdings in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be
paid to the Secured Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether
matured or unmatured.

         10.06 TERMINATION; REINSTATEMENT.
               --------------------------

         This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all
Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and
effect until all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty
are paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect
to the Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case
may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or Holdings is made, or
any of the Secured Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the
Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part
thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by any of the Secured Parties in their discretion) to be repaid
to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been
made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Secured Parties
are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any
prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of
Holdings under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.

         10.07 SUBORDINATION.
               -------------

         Holdings hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and
indebtedness of the Borrower owing to Holdings, whether now existing or
hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Borrower
to Holdings as subrogee of the Secured Parties or resulting from Holdings'
performance under this Guaranty, to the payment in full in cash of all
Obligations. If the Secured Parties so request, any such obligation or
indebtedness of the Borrower to Holdings shall be enforced and performance
received by Holdings as trustee for the Secured Parties and the proceeds
thereof shall be paid over to the Secured Parties on account of

                                     129


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability
of Holdings under this Guaranty.

         10.08 STAY OF ACCELERATION.
               --------------------

         If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is
stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against Holdings or the
Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall
nonetheless be payable by Holdings immediately upon demand by the Secured
Parties.

         10.09 CONDITION OF BORROWER.
               ---------------------

         Holdings acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility
for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other
guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and
operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as Holdings requires,
and that none of the Secured Parties has any duty, and Holdings is not relying
on the Secured Parties at any time, to disclose to Holdings any information
relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or
any other guarantor (Holdings waiving any duty on the part of the Secured
Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure
to provide the same).

         10.10 ADDITIONAL GUARANTOR WAIVERS AND AGREEMENTS.
               -------------------------------------------

                  (a) Holdings understands and acknowledges that if the
         Secured Parties foreclose judicially or nonjudicially against any
         real property security for the Obligations, that foreclosure could
         impair or destroy any ability that Holdings may have to seek
         reimbursement, contribution, or indemnification from the Borrower or
         others based on any right Holdings may have of subrogation,
         reimbursement, contribution, or indemnification for any amounts paid
         by Holdings under this Guaranty. Holdings further understands and
         acknowledges that in the absence of this paragraph, such potential
         impairment or destruction of Holdings' rights, if any, may entitle
         Holdings to assert a defense to this Guaranty based on Section 580d
         of the California Code of Civil Procedure as interpreted in Union
                                                                     -----
         Bank v. Gradsky, 265 Cal. App. 2d 40 (1968). By executing this
         ---------------
         Guaranty, Holdings freely, irrevocably, and unconditionally: (i)
         waives and relinquishes that defense and agrees that Holdings will be
         fully liable under this Guaranty even though the Secured Parties may
         foreclose, either by judicial foreclosure or by exercise of power of
         sale, any deed of trust securing the Obligations; (ii) agrees that
         Holdings will not assert that defense in any action or proceeding
         which the Secured Parties may commence to enforce this Guaranty;
         (iii) acknowledges and agrees that the rights and defenses waived by
         Holdings in this Guaranty include any right or defense that Holdings
         may have or be entitled to assert based upon or arising out of any
         one or more of Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code
         of Civil Procedure or Section 2848 of the California Civil Code; and
         (iv) acknowledges and agrees that the Secured Parties are relying on
         this waiver in creating the Obligations, and that this waiver is a
         material part of the consideration which the Secured Parties are
         receiving for creating the Obligations.

                  (b) Holdings waives all rights and defenses that Holdings
         may have because any of the Obligations is secured by real property.
         This means, among other things: (i) the Secured Parties may collect
         from Holdings without first foreclosing on any real or personal
         property collateral pledged by the other Loan Parties; and (ii) if
         the Secured Parties foreclose on any real property collateral pledged
         by the other Loan Parties: (A) the amount of the Obligations may be
         reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the
         foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale
         price, and (B) the Secured Parties may collect from Holdings even if
         the Secured Parties, by foreclosing on the real property collateral,
         have destroyed any right Holdings may have to collect from the
         Borrower. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any
         rights and defenses Holdings may have because any of the Obligations
         is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but
         are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a,
         580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

                  (c) Holdings waives any right or defense it may have at law
         or equity, including California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a,
         to a fair market value hearing or action to determine a deficiency
         judgment after a foreclosure.

         preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or
         (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from
         any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the
         Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related

         liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice
         purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower, except to the
         extent that such losses, costs, expenses or liabilities are
         determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
         to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
         such Person. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic
         communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
         Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents
         to such recording.

to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The

         directors, shareholders or creditors, and regardless of whether any
         Indemnitee is a party thereto, in all cases, whether or not caused by
         or arising, in whole or in part, out of the comparative, contributory
         or sole negligence of the Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity

         Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or
         any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally
         agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent),
         the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such
         Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
         applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
         such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or

                      ------------------------------------
         extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Borrower nor any
         Indemnitee shall assert, and each of the Borrower and the Indemnitees
         hereby waives, any claim against the Borrower, any other Loan Party
         or any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
         consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
         damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
         Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
         contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
         any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No
         Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for
         any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
         information or other materials distributed to such unintended
         recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic
         or other information transmission systems in connection with this
         Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions
         contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or

                      --------
         the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the
         Swing Line Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of
         the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
         discharge of all the other Obligations.

         11.05 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.
               ------------------

         To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is
made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of
setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of
such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender
and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon
demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered
from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the

date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal
to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall
survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.

with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date
of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute
and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance
with Section 11.06(d).

         (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C
         Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
         Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender
         sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
         retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
         amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;

                  (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall
                     ------------------------------------
         not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01,
                                                              ------------

         ----    ----
         receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
         unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with
         the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a
         Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
         benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the
                     ------------
         participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees,
         for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as
                                                         ---------------
         though it were a Lender.

                  (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or
                      ---------------
         assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under
         this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure
         obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to
         secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such
                                                       --------
         pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
         obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
         such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words
                      -----------------------------------
         "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any
         Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic
         signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of
         which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability
         as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
         recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as
         provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic
         Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State
         Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state
         laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

         Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         ----------
         herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Revolving
         Credit Commitments and Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section
                                                                   -------
         11.06(b), Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days' notice to the
         --------
         Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30
         days' notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the
         event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the
         Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a
         successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided,
                                                              --------
         however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such
         -------
         successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C
         Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America
         resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers,
         privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all
         Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
         resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect
         thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate
         Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
         Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it
         ---------------
         shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for
         hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding
         as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to
         require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk
         participations in outstanding Swing Line

         Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a
                           ---------------
         successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor
         shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
         privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line
         Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall
         issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if
         any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other
         arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume
         the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of
         Credit.

         11.07 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.
               -------------------------------------------------

         Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and
its Affiliates' respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction
over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process
(provided, that in the event of any such disclosure under this clause (c), the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be,
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Borrower of such
disclosure to the extent not prohibited by Law), (d) to any other party
hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under
any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially
the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in,
or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating
to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or
(h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than
as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective
Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower
(other than through a Person whom the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the
L/C Issuer actually knows to be acting in violation of his or its obligations
to the Borrower or any other Loan Party).

         For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information
                                        -----------
received from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof relating to any Loan
Party or any Subsidiary thereof or their respective businesses, other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan
Party or any Subsidiary thereof, provided that, in the case of information
                                 --------
received from a Loan Party or any such Subsidiary after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

                                     143


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public
information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b)
it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material
non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public
information in accordance with applicable Law, including Federal and state
securities Laws.

         11.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF.
               ---------------

         If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each
Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any
time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by
such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the
account of Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all
of the obligations of Holdings, the Borrower or such Loan Party now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the
L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and although such obligations of Holdings, the Borrower or such Loan
Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such
Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such
deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the L/C
Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender,
the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the
L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly
after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such
                                       --------
notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

         11.09 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.
               ------------------------

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan
Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by
applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender
                     ------------
shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess
interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such
unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the
interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a
Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

               ---------------------------

         This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an
original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
                                ------------
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and
when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

         11.11 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
               ------------------------------------------

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other
Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be
relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any
investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit
Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or
any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any
Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

         11.12 SEVERABILITY.
               ------------

         If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties
shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         11.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.
               ----------------------

         If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the
                                                   ------------
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01,
                                                                 ------------
if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any other circumstance exists
hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party
hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to
such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests,
                                        -------------
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
                                              --------

                  (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent
         the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 11.06(b);
                                                         ----------------

                  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount
         equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances,
         accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable
         to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any
         amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such
                       ------------
         outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower
         (in the case of all other amounts);

                  (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
         claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be
                                      ------------
         made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a
                          ------------
         reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and

                  (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

         A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

         11.14 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.
               --------------------------------

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND

                  (a) The Borrower, Holdings, the Administrative Agent, the
         L/C Issuer and the Lenders hereby agree that upon the effectiveness
         of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the Existing Credit
         Agreement shall be and hereby are amended and restated in their
         entirety by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
         and provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement, except as otherwise

         the Lenders with respect to agreements on the part of the Borrower
         and Holdings under the Existing Credit Agreement to indemnify and
