To: Prudential Investment Management, Inc.
       (herein called "PRUDENTIAL")

    Each Prudential Affiliate (as hereinafter defined)
       which becomes bound by certain provisions of this
       Agreement as hereinafter provided (the "PURCHASERS")

    c/o Prudential Capital Group
    2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 4200E
    Dallas, TX 75201

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          The undersigned, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "COMPANY"),
hereby agrees with you as follows:

          1. AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE OF NOTES. The Company will authorize the
issue of its senior promissory notes (the "NOTES") from time to time in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in the aggregate principal
amount of up to $200,000,000, to be dated the date of issue thereof; to mature,
in the case of each Note so issued, no more than 5 years after the date of
original issuance thereof; to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from
the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms,
as shall be set forth, in the case of each Note so issued, in the Confirmation
of Acceptance with respect to such Note delivered pursuant to paragraph 2F; and
to be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 attached hereto. The term "NOTES"
as used herein shall include each Note delivered pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement and each Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such
Note pursuant to any such provision. Notes which have (i) the same final
maturity, (ii) the same principal prepayment dates, (iii) the same principal
prepayment amounts (as a percentage of the original principal amount of each
Note), (iv) the same interest rate, and (v) the same original date of issuance
are herein called a "SERIES" of Notes. Capitalized terms used herein have the
meanings specified in paragraph 10.

          2. PURCHASE AND SALE OF NOTES.

          2A. FACILITY. Prudential is willing to consider, in its sole
discretion and within limits which may be authorized for purchase by Prudential
Affiliates from time to time, the purchase of Notes pursuant to this Agreement.
The willingness of Prudential to consider such purchase of Notes is herein
called the "FACILITY". At any time, the aggregate principal amount of Notes
stated in paragraph 1, minus the aggregate principal amount of Notes purchased
and sold pursuant to this Agreement prior to such time, minus the aggregate
principal amount of Accepted Notes (as hereinafter defined) which have not yet
been purchased and sold hereunder prior to such time is herein called the
"AVAILABLE FACILITY AMOUNT" at such time. NOTWITHSTANDING THE WILLINGNESS OF
PRUDENTIAL TO CONSIDER

<PAGE>

PURCHASES OF NOTES BY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATES, THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO ON
THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT NEITHER PRUDENTIAL NOR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE
SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCEPT OFFERS TO PURCHASE NOTES, OR TO QUOTE
RATES, SPREADS OR OTHER TERMS WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PURCHASES OF NOTES, AND
THE FACILITY SHALL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY PRUDENTIAL OR ANY
PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE.

          2B. ISSUANCE PERIOD. Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this
Agreement until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2007 and (ii) the fifteenth day
after Prudential shall have given to the Company, or the Company shall have
given to Prudential, written notice stating that it elects to terminate the
issuance and sale of Notes pursuant to this Agreement (or if such fifteenth day
is not a Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such fifteenth day). The
period during which Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement is
herein called the "ISSUANCE PERIOD".

          2C. PERIODIC SPREAD INFORMATION. Provided no Default or Event of
Default exists, not later than 9:30 A.M. (New York City local time) on a
Business Day during the Issuance Period if there is an Available Facility Amount
on such Business Day, the Company may request by telecopier or telephone, and
Prudential will, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide to the Company on
such Business Day (or, if such request is received after 9:30 A.M. (New York
City local time) on such Business Day, on the following Business Day),
information (by telecopier or telephone) with respect to various spreads at
which Prudential Affiliates might be interested in purchasing Notes of different
average lives; provided, however, that the Company may not make such requests
more frequently than once in every five Business Days or such other period as
shall be mutually agreed to by the Company and Prudential. The amount and
content of information so provided shall be in the sole discretion of Prudential
but it is the intent of Prudential to provide information which will be of use
to the Company in determining whether to initiate procedures for use of the
Facility. Information so provided shall not constitute an offer to purchase
Notes, and neither Prudential nor any Prudential Affiliate shall be obligated to
purchase Notes at the spreads specified. Information so provided shall be
representative of potential interest only for the period commencing on the day
such information is provided and ending on the earlier of the fifth Business Day
after such day and the first day after such day on which further spread
information is provided. Prudential may suspend or terminate providing
information pursuant to this paragraph 2C for any reason, including its
determination that the credit quality of the Company has declined since the date
of this Agreement.

          2D. REQUEST FOR PURCHASE. The Company may from time to time during the
Issuance Period make requests for purchases of Notes (each such request being a
"REQUEST FOR PURCHASE"). Each Request for Purchase shall be made to Prudential
by telecopier or overnight delivery service, and shall (i) specify the aggregate
principal amount of Notes covered thereby, which shall not be less than
$5,000,000 and not be greater than the Available Facility Amount at the time
such Request for Purchase is made, (ii) specify the principal amounts, final
maturities, principal prepayment dates and amounts of the Notes covered thereby,
(iii) specify the use of proceeds of such Notes, (iv) specify the proposed day
for the closing of the purchase and sale of such Notes, which, unless otherwise
agreed by Prudential, shall be a Business Day during the


                                        2

<PAGE>

Issuance Period not less than 10 days and not more than 25 days after the making
of such Request for Purchase, (v) specify the number of the account and the name
and address of the depository institution to which the purchase prices of such
Notes are to be transferred on the Closing Day for such purchase and sale, (vi)
certify that, except as specified in such Request for Purchase, the
representations and warranties contained in paragraph 8 are true on and as of
the date of such Request for Purchase and that there exists on the date of such
Request for Purchase no Event of Default or Default, (vii) specify the
Designated Spread for such Notes and (viii) be substantially in the form of
Exhibit B attached hereto. Each Request for Purchase shall be in writing and
shall be deemed made when received by Prudential.

          2E. RATE QUOTES. Not later than five Business Days after the Company
shall have given Prudential a Request for Purchase pursuant to paragraph 2D,
Prudential may, but shall be under no obligation to, provide to the Company by
telephone or telecopier, in each case between 9:30 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. New York
City local time (or such later time as Prudential may elect) interest rate
quotes for the several principal amounts, maturities and principal prepayment
schedules of Notes specified in such Request for Purchase. Each quote shall
represent the interest rate per annum payable on the outstanding principal
balance of such Notes, at which a Prudential Affiliate would be willing to
purchase such Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof.

          2F. ACCEPTANCE. Within 30 minutes after Prudential shall have provided
any interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph 2E or such shorter period as
Prudential may specify to the Company (such period being the "ACCEPTANCE
WINDOW"), the Company may, subject to paragraph 2G, elect to accept such
interest rate quotes as to any portion not less than $5,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of the Notes specified in the related Request for Purchase.
Such election shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Company notifying
Prudential by telephone or telecopier within the Acceptance Window that the
Company elects to accept such interest rate quotes, specifying the Notes (each
such Note being an "ACCEPTED NOTE") as to which such acceptance (an
"ACCEPTANCE") relates. The day the Company notifies an Acceptance with respect
to any Accepted Notes is herein called the "ACCEPTANCE DAY" for such Accepted
Notes. Any interest rate quotes as to which Prudential does not receive an
Acceptance within the Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of
Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes.
Subject to paragraph 2G and the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company
agrees to sell to a Prudential Affiliate, and Prudential agrees to cause the
purchase by a Prudential Affiliate of, the Accepted Notes at 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes. As soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Day, the Company, Prudential and each Prudential Affiliate which is to purchase
any such Accepted Notes will execute a confirmation of such Acceptance
substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (a "CONFIRMATION OF
ACCEPTANCE"). If the Company should fail to execute and return to Prudential
within two Business Days following receipt thereof a Confirmation of Acceptance
with respect to any Accepted Notes, Prudential may at its election at any time
prior to its receipt thereof cancel the closing with respect to such Accepted
Notes by so notifying the Company in writing.

          2G. MARKET DISRUPTION. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2F,
if Prudential shall have provided interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph 2E
and thereafter prior to the time an Acceptance with respect to such quotes shall
have been notified to Prudential in


                                        3

<PAGE>

accordance with paragraph 2F the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities or
derivatives shall have closed or there shall have occurred a general suspension,
material limitation, or significant disruption of trading in securities
generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the domestic market for U.S.
Treasury securities or derivatives, then such interest rate quotes shall expire,
and no purchase or sale of Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired
interest rate quotes. If the Company thereafter notifies Prudential of the
Acceptance of any such interest rate quotes, such Acceptance shall be
ineffective for all purposes of this Agreement, and Prudential shall promptly
notify the Company that the provisions of this paragraph 2G are applicable with
respect to such Acceptance.

          2H. CLOSING.

          2H(1). SERIES A CLOSING. The Company hereby agrees to sell to the
Purchasers and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each
Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company under the Facility 5.91% Senior
Notes due February 28, 2011 (the "SERIES A NOTES") in the aggregate principal
amount set forth opposite its name on the Purchaser Schedule attached hereto at
100% of such aggregate principal amount. The Series A Notes shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto. The Company will
deliver to Prudential, at the offices of Prudential Capital Group at 2200 Ross
Avenue, Suite 4200E, Dallas, Texas, 75201 or, at the request of Prudential, at
the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P. at 2001 Ross Avenue, Suite 600, Dallas, Texas
75201, one or more Notes registered in the name of the Purchasers, evidencing
the aggregate principal amount of Series A Notes to be purchased by the
Purchasers and in the denomination or denominations specified in the Purchaser
Schedule attached hereto against payment of the purchase price thereof by
transfer of immediately available funds to the credit of the Company's account
at JPMorgan Chase AZ, Phoenix, Arizona, Account Number 22703938 (ABA No.
122100024) on the date of closing, which shall be February 28, 2006, or any
other date upon which the Company and Prudential may mutually agree in writing
(the "SERIES A CLOSING").

          2H(2). SUBSEQUENT CLOSINGS. Not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City
local time) on the Closing Day for any Accepted Notes, the Company will deliver
to each Purchaser listed in the Confirmation of Acceptance relating thereto at
the offices of Prudential Capital Group at 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 4200E,
Dallas, Texas 75201 the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser in the
form of one or more Notes in authorized denominations as such Purchaser may
request for each Series of Accepted Notes to be purchased on the Closing Day,
dated the Closing Day and registered in such Purchaser's name (or in the name of
its nominee), against payment of the purchase price thereof by transfer of
immediately available funds for credit to the Company's account specified in the
Request for Purchase of such Notes.

          2H(3). RESCHEDULED CLOSINGS. If the Company fails to tender to any
Purchaser the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser on the scheduled
Closing Day for such Accepted Notes as provided above in this paragraph 2H, or
any of the conditions specified in paragraph 3 shall not have been fulfilled by
the time required on such scheduled Closing Day, the Company shall, prior to
1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day notify
Prudential (which notification shall be deemed received by each Purchaser) in
writing whether (x) such closing is to be rescheduled (such rescheduled date to
be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than one Business Day and
not more than 30 Business Days after


                                        4

<PAGE>

such scheduled Closing Day (the "RESCHEDULED CLOSING DAY") and certify to
Prudential (which certification shall be for the benefit of each Purchaser) that
the Company reasonably believes that it will be able to comply with the
conditions set forth in paragraph 3 on such Rescheduled Closing Day and that the
Company will pay the Delayed Delivery Fee in accordance with paragraph 2I(2) or
(y) such closing is to be canceled as provided in paragraph 2I(3). In the event
that the Company shall fail to give such notice referred to in the preceding
sentence, Prudential (on behalf of each Purchaser) may at its election, at any
time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day,
notify the Company in writing that such closing is to be canceled as provided in
paragraph 2I(3). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary appearing in this
Agreement, the Company may elect to reschedule a closing with respect to any
given Accepted Notes on not more than one occasion, unless Prudential shall have
otherwise consented in writing.

          2I. FEES.

          2I(1). ISSUANCE FEE. The Company will pay to Prudential in immediately
available funds a fee (the "ISSUANCE FEE") on each Closing Day (other than the
Series A Closing) in an amount equal to 0.125% of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes sold on such Closing Day.

          2I(2). DELAYED DELIVERY FEE. If the closing of the purchase and sale
of any Accepted Note is delayed for any reason beyond the original Closing Day
for such Accepted Note, the Company will pay to the Purchaser of such Accepted
Note on the Cancellation Date or actual closing date of such purchase and sale a
fee (the "DELAYED DELIVERY FEE") calculated as follows:

                           (BEY - MMY) X DTS/360 X PA

where "BEY" means Bond Equivalent Yield, i.e., the bond equivalent yield per
annum of such Accepted Note, "MMY" means Money Market Yield, i.e., the yield per
annum on a commercial paper investment of the highest quality selected by
Prudential on the date Prudential receives notice of the delay in the closing
for such Accepted Note having a maturity date or dates the same as, or closest
to, the Rescheduled Closing Day or Rescheduled Closing Days (a new alternative
investment being selected by Prudential each time such closing is delayed);
"DTS" means Days to Settlement, i.e., the number of actual days elapsed from and
including the original Closing Day with respect to such Accepted Note to but
excluding the date of such payment; and "PA" means Principal Amount, i.e., the
principal amount of the Accepted Note for which such calculation is being made.
In no case shall the Delayed Delivery Fee be less than zero. Nothing contained
herein shall obligate any Purchaser to purchase any Accepted Note on any day
other than the Closing Day for such Accepted Note, as the same may be
rescheduled from time to time in compliance with paragraph 2H.

          2I(3). CANCELLATION FEE. If the Company at any time notifies
Prudential in writing that the Company is canceling the closing of the purchase
and sale of any Accepted Note, or if Prudential notifies the Company in writing
under the circumstances set forth in the penultimate sentence of paragraph 2H(3)
that the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note


                                        5
<PAGE>

is to be canceled, or if the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted
Note is not consummated on or prior to the last day of the Issuance Period (the
date of any such notification, or the last day of the Issuance Period, as the
case may be, being the "CANCELLATION DATE"), the Company will pay the Purchasers
in immediately available funds an amount (the "CANCELLATION FEE") calculated as
follows:

                                     PI X PA

where "PI" means Price Increase, i.e., the quotient (expressed in decimals)
obtained by dividing (a) the excess of the ask price (as determined by
Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Note(s) on the Cancellation Date over the bid
price (as determined by Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Notes(s) on the
Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note by (b) such bid price; and "PA" has the
meaning specified in paragraph 2I(2). The foregoing bid and ask prices shall be
as reported by TradeWeb LLC (or, if such data for any reason ceases to be
available through TradeWeb LLC, any publicly available source of similar market
data). Each price shall be rounded to the second decimal place. In no case shall
the Cancellation Fee be less than zero.

          3. CONDITIONS OF CLOSING. The obligation of any Purchaser to purchase
and pay for any Notes is subject to the satisfaction, on or before the Closing
Day for such Notes, of the following conditions:

          3A. CERTAIN DOCUMENTS. Such Purchaser shall have received the
following, each dated the date of the applicable Closing Day:

          (i) The Note(s) to be purchased by such Purchaser.

          (ii) Certified copies of the resolutions of the Board of Directors of
     the Company authorizing the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
     the issuance of the Notes, and of all documents evidencing other necessary

     however, that delivery pursuant to clause (iii) below of copies of the
     Quarterly Report on Form l0-Q of the Company for such quarterly period
     filed with the SEC shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
     clause (i) with respect to consolidated financial statements so long as
     such Report on Form 10-Q includes the financial statements required by Form

          (ii) as soon as practicable and in any event within 120 days after the

     the Company, whose report shall state that said financial statements fairly
     present in all material respects the financial position and results of
     operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at the end
     of, and for, such fiscal year in accordance with GAAP (except as disclosed
     therein); provided, however, that delivery pursuant to clause (iii) below
     of copies of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for such fiscal
     year filed with the SEC shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
     clause (ii) with respect to consolidated financial statements and the
     auditor's report so long as such Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the

     waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the Code, a

<PAGE>

     posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or the Code, a certificate
     of an Responsible Officer setting forth details as to such occurrence and
     action, if any, which the Company or applicable member of the ERISA
     Affiliate is required or proposes to take; and

          (v) with reasonable promptness, such other information respecting the
     condition or operations, financial or otherwise, of the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries as such Significant Holder may reasonably request.

Together with each delivery of financial statements required by clauses (i) and
(ii) above, the Company will deliver to each Significant Holder an Officer's
Certificate demonstrating (with computations in reasonable detail) compliance by
the Company with the provisions of paragraph 6A and stating that there exists no
Event of Default or Default, or, if any Event of Default or Default exists,
specifying the nature thereof and what action the Company proposes to take with
respect thereto. Information required to be delivered pursuant to clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) above shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which
the Company provides notice to each Significant Holder that such information has
been posted on the Company's website at www.pinnaclewest.com, at
sec.gov/edaux/searches.htm or at another website identified in such notice and
accessible by the Significant Holders without charge; provided that (a) such
notice may be included in any Officer's Certificate described in the foregoing
sentence and (b) the Company shall deliver paper copies of the information
referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above to any Significant Holder which
requests such delivery.

          The Company also covenants that as soon as possible and in any event
within five Business Days after any Responsible Officer obtains knowledge of an
Event of Default or Default then continuing, it will deliver to each holder of
any Notes an Officer's Certificate specifying the nature thereof and what action
the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.

          5B. INFORMATION REQUIRED BY RULE 144A. The Company will, upon the
request of the holder of any Note, provide such holder, and any qualified
institutional buyer designated by such holder, such financial and other
information as such holder may reasonably determine to be necessary in order to
permit compliance with the information requirements of Rule 144A under the
Securities Act in connection with the resale of Notes, except at such times as
the Company is subject to and in compliance with the reporting requirements of
section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. For the purpose of this paragraph 5B,
the term "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" shall have the meaning specified in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

          5C. INSPECTION OF PROPERTY. The Company will permit any Person
designated by any Significant Holder in writing, at such Significant Holder's
expense if no Default or Event of Default exists and at the Company's expense if
a Default or Event of Default does exist, to visit and inspect any of the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to examine the corporate books
and financial records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and make copies
thereof or extracts therefrom and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts
of any of such corporations with the principal officers of the Company and its
independent public accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as
such Significant Holder may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
Company and its Subsidiaries reserve the right to restrict access to any of
their properties in accordance with reasonably adopted policies relating to
safety; and,


                                       11

<PAGE>

provided further, that such Significant Holder complies with reasonably adopted
security policies.

          5D. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY; INSURANCE.

          (i) The Company will keep, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary
     to keep, all property useful and necessary in its business in good working
     order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, if the failure to do
     so is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial
     condition or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated
     Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, it being understood that this covenant
     relates only to the working order and condition of such properties and
     shall not be construed as a covenant not to dispose of properties.

          (ii) The Company will maintain, and cause each Significant Subsidiary
     to maintain, insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies
     or associations in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
     carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar
     properties in the same general areas in which the Company or such
     Significant Subsidiary operates; provided, however, that the Company and
     APS may self-insure to the same extent as other companies engaged in
     similar businesses and owning similar properties in the same general areas
     in which the Company or such Significant Subsidiary operates.

          5E. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE.

          (i) Subject to paragraph 6B hereof, the Company will preserve and
     maintain, and will cause APS to preserve and maintain, its corporate
     existence and all rights and privileges (other than, in the case of APS,
     "franchises" as described in Arizona Revised Statutes, Section 40-283 or
     any successor provision) reasonably necessary in the normal conduct of its
     business, if the failure to maintain such rights or privileges is
     reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial
     condition or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated
     Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, and will cause APS to use its
     commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and maintain such franchises
     reasonably necessary in the normal conduct of its business, except that (a)
     APS from time to time may make minor extensions of its lines, plants,
     services or systems prior to the time a related franchise, certificate of
     convenience and necessity, license or permit is procured, (b) from time to
     time communities served by APS may become incorporated and considerable
     time may elapse before such a franchise is procured, (c) certain such
     franchises may have expired prior to the renegotiation thereof, (d) certain
     minor defects and exceptions may exist which, individually and in the
     aggregate, are not material and (e) certain franchises, certificates,
     licenses and permits may not be specific as to their geographical scope.

          (ii) The Company will continue to conduct, directly or through its
     Subsidiaries, the same general type of business conducted by the Company
     and APS on the date hereof.

          5F. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Company will comply, and cause each of
its Significant Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects with all
applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and requirements of
governmental authorities (including, without limitation, environmental laws and
ERISA and the rules and regulations thereunder) except where (i) the necessity
of compliance therewith is contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or
(ii) the noncompliance with which is not reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or financial prospects of the Company
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.

          5G. COVENANT TO SECURE NOTES EQUALLY. The Company will not create,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien on the capital stock of any Significant
Subsidiary owned by the Company unless the holders of Notes are also granted a
Lien thereon on a pari passu basis securing all of the Company's obligations
under the Notes.

          5H. OWNERSHIP OF APS. The Company will at all times continue to own
directly at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of APS.

          5I. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND ADDITIONAL DEFAULTS. If, after the date
hereof, the Company enters into, assumes or otherwise becomes bound or obligated
under any agreement (including amendments of the Bank Agreement) evidencing,
securing, guaranteeing or otherwise relating to the Bank Obligations that
contains one or more Additional Covenants or Additional Defaults, the terms of
this Agreement shall, without any further action on the part of the Company or
any of the holders of the Notes, be deemed to be amended automatically to
include each Additional Covenant and each Additional Default contained in such
agreement. The Company further covenants to promptly execute and deliver at its
expense (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the holders
of the Notes) an amendment to this Agreement in form and substance satisfactory
to the Required Holder(s) evidencing the amendment of this Agreement to include
such Additional Covenants and Additional Defaults, provided that the execution
and delivery of such amendment shall not be a precondition to the effectiveness
of such amendment as provided for in this paragraph 5I, but shall merely be for
the convenience of the parties hereto.

          6. NEGATIVE COVENANTS. During the Issuance Period, from and after the
Business Day immediately preceding the Series A Closing, and so long thereafter
as any Note or other amount due hereunder is outstanding and unpaid, the Company
covenants as follows:

          6A. DEBT. Consolidated Debt will not exceed at any time an amount
equal to 65% of Consolidated Capitalization.

          6B. CONSOLIDATIONS; MERGERS AND SALES OF ASSETS. The Company will not,
nor will it permit any Significant Subsidiary to, merge or consolidate with or
into any other Person, except (i) any Significant Subsidiary may merge or
consolidate with the Company if the Company is the corporation surviving such
merger, (ii) any Significant Subsidiary may merge or consolidate with any other
Subsidiary, provided that the Company's aggregate direct and indirect ownership
interest in the survivor thereof shall not be less than the greater of the
Company's direct and indirect ownership interest in such Subsidiaries prior to
such merger, and (iii) the


                                       13

<PAGE>

Company or any Significant Subsidiary may merge or consolidate with any other
Person if (a) such Person was organized under the laws of the United States of
America or one of its States and (b) the Company or such Significant Subsidiary
is the corporation surviving such merger; provided that, in each case, after
giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default will be in existence. The
Company will not sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets, or permit any of its Significant Subsidiaries
to sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its assets, except for sales, leases, transfers, assignments, and other
dispositions of all or substantially all of the Company's or any such
Significant Subsidiary's assets to the Company or any other Subsidiary of the
Company, provided in each case that no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing after giving effect thereto and provided further that
(i) in no case will the merger of PWEC into the Company with the Company
surviving be governed or prohibited by this paragraph 6B, and (ii) this
paragraph 6B will not govern or prohibit pledges or the grant of security
interests, mortgages or other Liens on any assets.

          6C. TERRORISM SANCTION REGULATIONS. The Company will not and will not
permit any Subsidiary to (i) become a Person described or designated in the
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Office of Foreign
Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order, unless such
description or designation is then being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, or (ii) knowingly engage in any dealings or transactions, except to
provide electricity to any APS customer, with any such Person.

          7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

          7A. ACCELERATION. If on or after the Series A Closing and so long
thereafter as any Note is outstanding and unpaid, any of the following events
shall occur and be continuing for any reason whatsoever (and whether such
occurrence shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be effected by
operation of law or otherwise):

          (i) the Company defaults in the payment of any principal of, or
     Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to, any Note when the same
     shall become due, either by the terms thereof or otherwise as herein
     provided; or

     thereto, or the Company or APS fails to perform or observe any other
     agreement, term or condition contained in any agreement under which any
     such Debt or Derivative Obligation is created and such failure shall
     continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in such
     agreement or instrument and the effect of such failure is to cause, or to
     permit the holder or holders of such Debt or Derivative Obligation (or a
     trustee on behalf of such holder or holders) to accelerate, or permit the
     acceleration of the maturity of, such Debt or Derivative Obligation; or


                                       14

<PAGE>

          (iv) any representation or warranty made by the Company herein or by

     reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its debts under any
     bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or
     seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
     other similar official of it or any substantial part of its property, and

     unstayed for a period of 60 days; or an order for relief shall be entered

     bankruptcy laws as now or hereafter in effect; or

          (ix) a final judgment in an amount in excess of $25,000,000 (excluding
     any such judgments to the extent a solvent insurer has acknowledged
     liability therefor in writing) is rendered against the Company or APS and,
     within 45 days after entry thereof, such judgment is not discharged or
     execution thereof stayed pending appeal, or within 45 days after the
     expiration of any such stay, such judgment is not discharged; or

          (x) any ERISA Affiliate shall fail to pay when due an amount or
     amounts aggregating in excess of $25,000,000 which it shall have become
     liable to pay under Title IV of ERISA; or notice of intent to terminate a
     Material Plan shall be filed under Title IV of ERISA by any ERISA
     Affiliate, any plan administrator or any combination of the foregoing which
     could cause one or more ERISA Affiliates to incur a liability in excess of
     $25,000,000; or the PBGC shall institute proceedings under Title IV of
     ERISA to terminate, to impose liability (other than for premiums under

     to administer any Material Plan which could cause one or more ERISA
     Affiliates to incur a liability in excess of $25,000,000 or a condition
     shall exist by reason of which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a
     decree


                                       15

<PAGE>

     adjudicating that any Material Plan must be terminated which could cause
     one or more ERISA Affiliates to incur a liability in excess of $25,000,000;
     or there shall occur a complete or partial withdrawal from, or a default,
     within the meaning of Section 4219(c) (5) of ERISA, with respect to, one or
     more Multiemployer Plans which could cause one or more ERISA Affiliates to
     incur a current payment obligation in excess of $25,000,000; or

          (xi) any Change in Control shall occur;

then (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (ii) of
this paragraph 7A, any holder of any Note (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) may at its option, by notice in writing to the
Company, declare all of the Notes held by such holder to be, and all of the
Notes held by such holder shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and
payable at par together with interest accrued thereon, without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the
Company, (b) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (vii) or
(viii) of this paragraph 7A with respect to the Company, all of the Notes at the
time outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable at par
together with interest accrued thereon and together with the Yield-Maintenance
Amount, if any, with respect to each Note, without presentment, demand, protest
or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Company, and (c) if
such event is any Event of Default other than as specified in preceding clause
(b), the Required Holder(s) of the Notes may at its or their option by notice in
writing to the Company, declare all of the Notes to be, and all of the Notes
shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together with
interest accrued thereon and together with the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any,
with respect to each Note, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Company.

          The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each
holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from
repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that
the provision for payment of the Yield-Maintenance Amount by the Company in the
event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of
Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right
under such circumstances.

          7B. RESCISSION OF ACCELERATION. At any time after any or all of the
Notes shall have been declared immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph
7A, the Required Holder(s) may, by notice in writing to the Company, rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if (i) the Company shall have paid
all overdue interest on the Notes, the principal of and Yield-Maintenance
Amount, if any, payable with respect to any Notes which have become due
otherwise than by reason of such declaration, and interest on such overdue
interest and overdue principal and Yield Maintenance Amount at the rate
specified in the Notes, (ii) the Company shall not have paid any amounts which
have become due solely by reason of such declaration, (iii) all Events of
Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts which have become due
solely by reason of such declaration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant
to paragraph 11C, and (iv) no judgment or decree shall have been entered for the
payment of any amounts due pursuant to the Notes or this Agreement. No such
rescission or annulment shall


                                       16

<PAGE>

extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any
right arising therefrom.

          7C. NOTICE OF ACCELERATION OR RESCISSION. Whenever any Note shall be
declared immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph 7A or any such
declaration shall be rescinded and annulled pursuant to paragraph 7B, the
Company shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the holder of each Note
at the time outstanding.

          7D. OTHER REMEDIES. If any Event of Default or Default shall occur and
be continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights under this Agreement and such Note by exercising such remedies as are
available to such holder in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement. No remedy conferred in this
Agreement upon the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

          8. REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES. Except as disclosed in
the Officer's Certificate referred to in paragraph 3C, as of each Closing Day
hereunder, the Company represents, covenants and warrants as follows (all
references to "SUBSIDIARY" and "SUBSIDIARIES" in this paragraph 8 shall be
deemed omitted if the Company has no Subsidiaries at the time the
representations herein are made or repeated):

          8A. ORGANIZATION. The Company is a corporation duly organized and
validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Arizona and APS
is a corporation duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of
the State of Arizona. Each of the Company and APS has the corporate power to own
its respective property and to carry on its respective business as now being
conducted. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Notes are within the Company's corporate powers and have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.

          8B. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has furnished Prudential and
each Purchaser with the following financial statements, identified by a
principal financial officer of the Company or posted on the Company's website on
the Internet at www.pinnaclewest.com or on sec.gov/edaux/searches.htm: (i) a
balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at December
31, 2004 and the related statements of income and cash flows of the Company and
its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended, all reported on by
Deloitte & Touche LLP; and (ii) a balance sheet of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2005 and the related statements of
income and cash flows of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the
nine months then ended. Such financial statements (including any related
schedules and/or notes) or the financial statements most recently provided
pursuant to Section 5A(i) and (ii) of this Agreement as of the date this
representation is made or repeated, fairly present in all material respects the
financial position and results of operations of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the end of, and for, the applicable fiscal year or fiscal
quarter, as the case may be, in accordance with GAAP, except as disclosed
therein and subject, as to interim statements, to changes resulting from audits


                                       17

<PAGE>

and year-end adjustments. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports or by means of
a letter delivered to Prudential and each Purchaser prior to any Closing Day,
there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition or
financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a
whole since the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial
statements have been furnished at the time of an Acceptance relating to the
Notes to be purchased.

          8C. ACTIONS PENDING. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports or by
means of a letter delivered to the Purchasers prior to any Closing Day, there is
no action, suit or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, by or
before any court, arbitrator or administrative or governmental body in which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which is reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or financial
prospects of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
There is no action, suit or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
purports to affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Note.

          8D. OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has outstanding any Indebtedness except as permitted by paragraph
6A. There exists no default under the provisions of any instrument evidencing
such Debt which is outstanding in a principal amount exceeding $25,000,000 or of
any agreement relating thereto.

          8E. TITLE TO PROPERTIES. The Company and APS have good and marketable
title in fee simple to their respective properties and assets, including the
properties and assets reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet
referred to in paragraph 8B, except any such assets held pursuant to any
arrangement accounted for as a capital lease or by any entity consolidated into
such balance sheet as a variable interest entity, subject to (i) assets disposed
of in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2004; (ii) any defects
in or encumbrances on title of the respective lessors or grantors of easements
or rights-of-way pursuant to which APS has installed transmission and
distribution lines; and (iii) other liens, encumbrances, or defects, none of
which, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the business
or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The
representation in the foregoing sentence is subject to the following
qualifications: (a) APS is the owner of the rights conferred upon it by the
leases from the Navajo Tribe relating to the sites on which the Navajo Plant and
the Four Corners Plant are situated and no representation is made with respect
to the enforceability of such leases against the Navajo Tribe; and (b) certain
defects in the leases of the Company and APS may exist which, together with the
qualification referred to in clause (a), individually and in the aggregate, are
not materially adverse to the financial condition or financial prospects of the
Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There are no
outstanding shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
shares of common stock of APS which are not held by the Company, nor any
outstanding agreements, rights or options to acquire, subscribe for or purchase
from APS any shares of its common stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of its common stock (other than agreements with or
rights or options held by the Company). All leases necessary for the conduct of
the respective businesses of the Company and APS are valid and subsisting and
are in full force and effect, except to the extent qualified in this paragraph
8E and except to the extent that


                                       18

<PAGE>

the failure of any such lease to be valid and subsisting and in full force and
effect would not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or
financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

          8F. TAXES. The Company and APS have filed all United States Federal
income tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed by
them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any
assessment received by the Company or APS, except to the extent that (i) such
taxes are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and that
appropriate reserves for the payment thereof have been maintained by the Company
and APS in accordance with GAAP or (ii) the failure to make such filings or such
payments is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books
of the Company and APS in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in
the opinion of the Company, adequate.

          8G. CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS. Neither the execution
nor delivery of this Agreement or the Notes, nor the offering, issuance and sale
of the Notes, nor fulfillment of nor compliance with the terms and provisions
hereof and of the Notes will conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in any
violation of, or (except as provided for or permitted herein) result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the
Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, any award of any arbitrator or
any agreement (including any agreement with stockholders), instrument, order,
judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which the Company or any
of its Significant Subsidiaries is subject. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise subject to any provision contained in,
any instrument evidencing Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary, any
agreement relating thereto or any other contract or agreement (including its
charter) which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the
incurring of, Debt of the Company of the type to be evidenced by the Notes
except as set forth in the agreements listed in Schedule 8G attached hereto.

          8H. OFFERING OF NOTES. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its
behalf has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes for sale to, or solicited
any offers to buy the Notes from, or otherwise approached or negotiated with
respect thereto with, any Person other than institutional investors, and neither
the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action
which would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the provisions of
Section 5 of the Securities Act or to the provisions of any securities or Blue
Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.

          8I. USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Series A Notes will be used
for general corporate purposes (which purposes will be for some lawful object
within the corporate purposes of the Company, compatible with the public
interest, and reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes), including
the repayment at maturity of the $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
6.40% Notes due April 1, 2006. None of the proceeds of the sale of any Notes
will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate,
incidental or ultimate, of purchasing or carrying any "MARGIN STOCK" as defined
in Regulation U (12 CFR Part 221) of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System ("margin stock") or for the


                                       19

<PAGE>

purpose of maintaining, reducing or retiring any Indebtedness which was
originally incurred to purchase or carry any stock that is then currently a
margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute the purchase of
such Notes a "purpose credit" within the meaning of such Regulation U or
Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, unless the
Company shall have delivered to the Purchaser which is purchasing such Notes, on
the Closing Day for such Notes, an opinion of counsel satisfactory to such
Purchaser stating that the purchase of such Notes does not constitute a
violation of such Regulation U or Regulation T. Neither the Company nor any
agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause
this Agreement or the Notes to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or any other
regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate
the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be
in effect.

          8J. ERISA. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section
302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan). No liability to the PBGC
has been or is expected by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to be incurred
with respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) by the Company, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate which is or would be materially adverse to the
financial condition or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or presently expects to incur any withdrawal liability
under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer Plan which is or would
be materially adverse to the financial condition or financial prospects of the
Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes will be exempt
from or will not involve any transaction which is subject to the prohibitions of
section 406 of ERISA and will not involve any transaction in connection with
which a penalty could be imposed under section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be
imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code. The representation by the Company
in the next preceding sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the
accuracy of the representation of each Purchaser in paragraph 9B as to the
source of funds to be used by it to purchase any Notes.

          8K. GOVERNMENTAL CONSENT. Neither the nature of the Company or of any
Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any
relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
any action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental or regulatory body (other than routine filings after the Closing
Day for any Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue
Sky authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes or fulfillment
of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes.

          8L. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LAWS. Except as described
in the SEC Reports or by means of a letter delivered to the Purchasers prior to
any Closing Day, the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries and all of their
respective properties and facilities comply in all respects with all federal,
state, local and regional statutes, laws, ordinances and judicial or
administrative orders, judgments, rulings and regulations, including those
relating to protection of the environment except, in any such case, where (i)
the necessity of compliance is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings or (ii) failure to comply is not


                                       20

<PAGE>

reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          8M. FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS, ETC. (i) Neither the sale of
the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the proceeds thereof will
violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets
control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle
B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order
relating thereto.

          (i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (a) is a Person described
     or designated in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons
     List of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti
     Terrorism Order or (b) knowingly engages in any dealings or transactions
     with any such Person, except to provide electricity to any APS customer.
     The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, in all material
     respects, with the USA Patriot Act.

          (ii) No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will
     be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental
     official or employee, political party, official of a political party,
     candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official
     capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any
     improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt
     Practices Act of 1977, as amended, assuming in all cases that such Act
     applies to the Company.

          8N. PERMITS AND OTHER OPERATING RIGHTS. Except as described in the SEC
Reports or by means of a letter delivered to the Purchasers prior to any Closing
Day, each of the Company and APS has all governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, if
the failure to hold any such governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          8O. UTILITY COMPANY STATUS. The Company is a "holding company" as such
term is defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 ("PUHCA
2005"). Pursuant to PUHCA 2005, the Company is subject to the limited
jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), and any State
commission with jurisdiction to regulate a public utility company in the
Company's holding company system, with respect to access to books and records of
the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Company is a "public
utility", as such term is defined in the Federal Power Act, as amended ("FPA")
and subject to FERC regulation under the FPA. The Company has obtained blanket
authority from FERC under Section 204 of the FPA to issue securities and assume
liabilities, and such authorization remains in full force and effect.

company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

          8Q. DISCLOSURE. Neither this Agreement nor any other document,
certificate or statement furnished to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the
Company in connection herewith (including without limitation the Company's SEC
Reports) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and
therein not misleading. There is no fact peculiar to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which materially adversely affects or in the future may (so far as
the Company can now foresee) materially adversely affect the financial condition
or financial prospects of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as
a whole and which has not been set forth in this Agreement or in the other
documents, certificates and statements furnished to each Purchaser by or on
behalf of the Company prior to the date hereof or any Closing Day (including
without limitation the Company's SEC Reports) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          8R. RULE 144A. The Notes are not of the same class as securities of
the Company, if any, listed on a national securities exchange, registered under
Section 6 of the Exchange Act or quoted in a U.S. automated inter-dealer
quotation system.

          8S. HOSTILE TENDER OFFERS. None of the proceeds of the sale of any
Notes will be used to finance a Hostile Tender Offer.

          9. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.

          Each Purchaser represents as follows:

          9A. NATURE OF PURCHASE. Such Purchaser is not acquiring the Notes

     reserves and liabilities for the general account contract(s) held by or on
     behalf of any other employee benefit plans maintained by the same employer

     organization in the general account do not exceed 10% of the total reserves
     and liabilities of the general account (exclusive of separate account
     liabilities) plus surplus as set forth in the NAIC Annual Statement filed
     with such Purchaser's state of domicile; or

          (ii) the Source is a separate account that is maintained solely in
     connection with such Purchaser's fixed contractual obligations under which

<PAGE>

     credited, to any employee benefit plan (or its related trust) that has any
     interest in such separate account (or to any participant or beneficiary of
     such plan (including any annuitant)) are not affected in any manner by the
     investment performance of the separate account; or

          (iii) the Source is either (a) an insurance company pooled separate

     Part V of the QPAM Exemption), no employee benefit plan's assets that are
     included in such investment fund, when combined with the assets of all
     other employee benefit plans established or maintained by the same employer
     or by an affiliate (within the meaning of Section V(c)(1) of the QPAM

     Exemption) owns a 5% or more interest in the Company and (a) the identity
     of such QPAM and (b) the names of all employee benefit plans whose assets

represents a potential liability of an ERISA Affiliate to the PBGC or any other

          11. MISCELLANEOUS.

          11A. NOTE PAYMENTS. The Company agrees that, so long as any Purchaser

Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to, such Note, which comply with

          11B. EXPENSES. The Company agrees, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, to pay, and save Prudential, each
Purchaser and any Transferee harmless against liability for the payment of, all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising in connection with such transactions,
consisting of the following:

          (i) (A) all stamp and documentary taxes and similar charges and (B)
     costs of obtaining a private placement number from S&P for the Notes, in
     each case as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
     the issuance of the Notes;

          (ii) reasonable document production and duplication charges and the
     fees and reasonable expenses of any special counsel engaged by Prudential
     or such Purchaser or such Transferee in connection with (A) the execution
     and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
     each issuance of Notes hereunder and (B) any subsequent proposed waiver,
     amendment or modification of, or proposed consent under, this Agreement,
     whether or not such proposed action shall be effected or granted;

          (iii) the costs and expenses, including attorneys' and financial
     advisory fees, incurred by Prudential or such Purchaser or such Transferee
     in enforcing (or determining whether or how to enforce) any rights under
     this Agreement or the Notes or in responding to any subpoena or other legal
     process or informal investigative demand issued in connection with this
     Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or by reason of
     Prudential or such Purchaser's or such Transferee's having acquired any
     Note, including without limitation costs and expenses incurred in any
     workout, restructuring or renegotiation proceeding or bankruptcy case; and

          (iv) any judgment, liability, claim, order, decree, cost, fee,
     expense, action or obligation incurred in connection with any
     investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding brought or threatened

     Company except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful
     misconduct of the payee or any of its affiliates or agents as determined by
     a court of competent jurisdiction.

          The Company will promptly pay or reimburse each Purchaser or holder of
a Note (upon demand, in accordance with each such Purchaser's or holder's
written instructions) for all fees and costs paid or payable by such Purchaser
or holder to the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners ("SVO") in connection with the initial filing of this
Agreement and all related documents and financial information, and all
subsequent annual and interim filings of documents and financial information
related to this Agreement, with the SVO or any successor organization acceding
to the authority thereof.

          The obligations of the Company under this paragraph 11B shall survive
the transfer of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein by any Purchaser
or Transferee and the payment of any Note.

          11C. CONSENT TO AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may be amended, and the
Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein
required to be


                                       34

<PAGE>

performed by it, if the Company shall obtain the written consent to such
amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s) except that, (i)
with the written consent of the holders of all Notes of a particular Series, and
if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, of the holders of
all Notes of all Series, at the time outstanding (and not without such written
consents), the Notes of such Series may be amended or the provisions thereof
waived to change the maturity thereof, to change or affect the principal
thereof, or to change or affect the time of payment of, or decrease the rate of,
interest on or any Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to the Notes of
such Series, (ii) without the written consent of the holder or holders of all
Notes at the time outstanding, no amendment to or waiver of the provisions of
this Agreement shall change or affect the provisions of paragraph 7A or this
paragraph 11C insofar as such provisions relate to proportions of the principal
amount of the Notes of any Series, or the rights of any individual holder of
Notes, required with respect to any declaration of Notes to be due and payable
or with respect to any consent, amendment, waiver or declaration, (iii) with the
written consent of Prudential (and not without the written consent of
Prudential) the provisions of paragraph 2 may be amended or waived (except
insofar as any such amendment or waiver would affect any rights or obligations
with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes which shall have become Accepted
Notes prior to such amendment or waiver), and (iv) with the written consent of
all of the Purchasers which shall have become obligated to purchase Accepted
Notes of any Series (and not without the written consent of all such
Purchasers), any of the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 may be amended or
waived insofar as such amendment or waiver would affect only rights or
obligations with respect to the purchase and sale of the Accepted Notes of such
Series or the terms and provisions of such Accepted Notes. Each holder of any
Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent
authorized by this paragraph 11C, whether or not such Note shall have been
marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may bear a
notation referring to any such consent. No course of dealing between the Company
and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or
under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such
Note. As used herein and in the Notes, the term "THIS AGREEMENT" and references
thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or
supplemented.

          11D. FORM, REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES; LOST NOTES.
The Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in denominations of
at least $2,500,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any principal amount
not evenly divisible by $2,500,000. The Company shall keep at its principal
office a register in which the Company shall provide for the registration of
Notes and of transfers of Notes. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Note at the principal office of the Company, the Company shall, at its
expense, execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of a like
aggregate principal amount, registered in the name of such transferee or
transferees. At the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be exchanged
for other Notes of like tenor and of any authorized denominations, of a like
aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the
principal office of the Company. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver the Notes which
the holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Each installment of
principal payable on each installment date upon each new Note issued upon any
such transfer or exchange shall be in the same proportion to the unpaid
principal amount of such new Note as the installment of principal payable on
such date on the Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange bore
to the unpaid principal amount of such Note. No reference need be made in any
such new Note to any installment or installments of


                                       35

<PAGE>

principal previously due and paid upon the Note surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange. Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer duly executed, by the holder of such Note or such holder's attorney
duly authorized in writing. Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or
upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to
accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that
neither gain nor loss of interest shall result from any such transfer or
exchange. Upon receipt of written notice from the holder of any Note of the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Note and, in the case of any such
loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of such holder's unsecured indemnity
agreement, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation
of such Note, the Company will make and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in
lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note. Any sale of Notes by a
holder will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws. No holder of
a Note will sell or otherwise transfer any Note to any Person described or
designated in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the
Office of Foreign Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order.

          11E. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS; PARTICIPATIONS. Prior to due presentment
for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in whose name any
Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payment of principal of and interest on, and any Yield-Maintenance
Amount payable with respect to, such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the Company shall not be affected
by notice to the contrary. Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any
Note may from time to time grant participations in all or any part of such Note
to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder
in its sole and absolute discretion, provided that, the Company shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such holder, such holder's rights and
obligations hereunder shall remain unchanged, and such holder shall retain the
sole right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision .

          11F. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT. All
representations and warranties contained herein or made in writing by or on
behalf of the Company in connection herewith shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the transfer by any Purchaser of any
Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may
be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of any investigation made at any
time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any Transferee. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement, the Notes and each Confirmation of
Acceptance embody the entire agreement and understanding between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.

          11G. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and other agreements in
this Agreement contained by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind
and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties
hereto (including, without limitation, any Transferee) whether so expressed or
not.

          11H. INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is prohibited by
any one of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception
to, or otherwise be in compliance


                                       36

<PAGE>

within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a
Default or Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

          11I. NOTICES. All written communications provided for hereunder (other
than communications provided for under paragraph 2) shall be sent by first class
mail or nationwide overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid) and (i) if
to any Purchaser, addressed as specified for such communications in the
Purchaser Schedule attached hereto or the Purchaser Schedule attached to the
applicable Confirmation of Acceptance (in the case of any Notes issued after the
date hereof) or at such other address as any such Purchaser shall have specified
to the Company in writing, (ii) if to any other holder of any Note, addressed to
it at such address as it shall have specified in writing to the Company, or, if
any such holder shall not have so specified an address, then addressed to such
holder in care of the last holder of such Note which shall have so specified an
address to the Company and (iii) if to the Company, addressed to it at 400 North
5th Street, 19th Floor, Phoenix, Arizona 85004, Attention: Treasurer, provided,
however, that any such communication may also, at the option of the Person
sending such communication, be delivered by any other means at the applicable
address specified above, addressed to the attention of the person designated to
receive such notice as provided in this paragraph 11I. Any communication
pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be made by the method specified for such
communication in paragraph 2, and shall be effective to create any rights or
obligations under this Agreement only if, in the case of a telephone
communication, an Authorized Officer of the party conveying the information and
of the party receiving the information are parties to the telephone call, and in
the case of a telecopier communication, the communication is signed by an
Authorized Officer of the party conveying the information, addressed to the
attention of an Authorized Officer of the party receiving the information, and
in fact received at the telecopier terminal the number of which is listed for
the party receiving the communication in the Purchaser Schedule or at such other
telecopier terminal as the party receiving the information shall have specified
in writing to the party sending such information.

          11J. PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS. Anything in this Agreement or
the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal of or
interest on, or Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to, any Note that
is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of
the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; provided that if the
maturity date of any series of the Notes is a date other than a Business Day,
then and in such event payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business
Day, but shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of
interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

          11K. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          11L. DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings of the several

          11M. SATISFACTION REQUIREMENT. If any agreement, certificate or other
writing, or any action taken or to be taken, is by the terms of this Agreement
required to be satisfactory to Prudential, any Purchaser, to any holder of Notes
or to the Required Holder(s), the determination of such satisfaction shall be

are to be several sales, and the obligations of Prudential and the Purchasers
under this Agreement are several obligations. No failure by Prudential or any
Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall relieve any
other Purchaser or the Company of any of its obligations hereunder, and neither
Prudential nor any Purchaser nor the Company shall be responsible for the
obligations of, or any action taken or omitted by, any other such Person
hereunder.

          11P. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
