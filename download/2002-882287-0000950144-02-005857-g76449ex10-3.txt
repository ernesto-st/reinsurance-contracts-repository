         Principal Office or such other account as may be designated in writing
         to Administrative Agent by Company.

                  2.3      SWING LINE LOANS.

                           (a)      Swing Line Loans Commitments. During the
Revolving Commitment Period, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Swing
Line Lender hereby agrees to make Swing Line Loans to Company in the aggregate
amount up to but not exceeding the Swing Line Sublimit; provided, after giving
effect to the making of any Swing Line Loan, in no event shall the Total
Utilization of Revolving Commitments exceed (i) the Revolving Commitments then
in effect or (ii) the Maximum Revolving Credit Amount then in effect. Amounts
borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.3 may be repaid and reborrowed during the
Revolving Commitment Period. Swing Line Lender's Revolving Commitment shall
expire on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date and all Swing Line Loans and
all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Swing Line Loans and the
Revolving Commitments shall be paid in full no later than such date.

                           (b)      Borrowing Mechanics for Swing Line Loans.

                                    (i)      Swing Line Loans shall be made in
         an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of
         $100,000 in excess of that amount.

                                    (ii)     Whenever Company desires that Swing
         Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan, Company shall deliver to
         Administrative Agent a Funding Notice no later than 12:00 p.m. (New
         York City time) on the proposed Credit Date.

                                    (iii)    Swing Line Lender shall make the
         amount of its Swing Line Loan available to Administrative Agent not
         later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the applicable Credit Date
         by wire transfer of same day funds in Dollars, at the Administrative
         Agent's Principal Office. Except as provided herein, upon satisfaction
         or waiver of the conditions precedent specified herein, Administrative
         Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swing Line Loans available to
         Company on the applicable Credit Date by causing an amount of same day
         funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Swing Line Loans
         received by Administrative Agent from Swing Line Lender to be credited
         to the account of Company at the Administrative Agent's Principal
         Office, or to such other account as may be designated in writing to
         Administrative Agent by Company.

                                    (iv)     With respect to any Swing Line
         Loans which have not been voluntarily prepaid by Company pursuant to
         Section 2.13, Swing Line Lender may at any time in its sole and
         absolute discretion, deliver to Administrative Agent (with a copy to
         Company), no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least one
         (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed Credit Date, a notice
         (which shall be deemed to be a Funding Notice given by Company)
         requesting that each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment make
         Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to Company on such Credit Date
         in an amount equal to the amount of such Swing Line Loans (the
         "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOANS") outstanding on the date such notice is
         given which the Swing Line Lender requests Lenders to prepay. Anything
         contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) the
         proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Lenders other than Swing
         Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by the Administrative Agent
         to Swing Line Lender (and not to Company) and applied to repay a
         corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line Loans and (2) on the
         day such Revolving Loans are made, Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share
         of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the
         proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by Swing Line Lender to Company, and
         such portion of the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no
         longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be due
         under the Swing Line Note of Swing Line Lender but shall instead
         constitute part of Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans to
         Company and shall be due under the Revolving Loan Note issued by
         Company to Swing Line Lender. Company hereby authorizes Administrative
         Agent and Swing Line Lender to charge Company's accounts with
         Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender (up to the amount available
         in each such account) in order to immediately pay Swing Line Lender the
         amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans to the extent the proceeds of
         such Revolving Loans made by Lenders, including the Revolving Loan
         deemed to be made by the Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to repay
         in full the Refunded Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any such
         amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to Swing Line Lender should be
         recovered by or on behalf of Company from Swing Line Lender in
         bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise,
         the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all
         Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.17.

                                    (v)      If for any reason Revolving Loans
         are not made pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iv) in an amount sufficient to
         repay any amounts owed to Swing Line Lender in respect of any
         outstanding Swing Line Loans on or before the third Business Day after
         demand for payment thereof by Swing Line Lender, each Lender holding a
         Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have
         purchased a participation in such outstanding Swing Line Loans, and in
         an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the applicable unpaid amount
         together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one (1) Business Day's
         notice from Swing Line Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving
         Commitment shall deliver to Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its
         respective participation in the applicable unpaid amount in same day
         funds at the Principal Office of Swing Line Lender. In order to
         evidence such participation each Lender holding a

                                      S-52
<PAGE>

         Revolving Commitment agrees to enter into a participation agreement at
         the request of Swing Line Lender in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to Swing Line Lender. In the event any Lender holding a
         Revolving Commitment fails to make available to Swing Line Lender the
         amount of such Lender's participation as provided in this paragraph,
         Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand
         from such Lender together with interest thereon for three Business Days
         at the rate customarily used by Swing Line Lender for the correction of
         errors among banks and thereafter at the Base Rate, as applicable.

                                    (vi)     Notwithstanding anything contained
         herein to the contrary, (1) each Lender's obligation to make Revolving
         Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans
         pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and each Lender's obligation
         to purchase a participation in any unpaid Swing Line Loans pursuant to
         the immediately preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional
         and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including without
         limitation (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
         right which such Lender may have against Swing Line Lender, any Credit
         Party or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence
         or continuation of a Default or Event of Default; (C) any adverse
         change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition
         (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Credit Party; (D) any
         breach of this Agreement or any other Credit Document by any party
         thereto; or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that such
         obligations of each Lender are -------- subject to the condition that
         Swing Line Lender believed in good faith that all conditions under
         Section 3.2 to the making of the applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans
         or other unpaid Swing Line Loans, were satisfied at the time such
         Refunded Swing Line Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made, or the
         satisfaction of any such condition not satisfied had been waived by
         Requisite Lenders prior to or at the time such Refunded Swing Line
         Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans were made; and (2) Swing Line
         Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loans (A) if it
         has elected not to do so after the occurrence and during the
         continuation of a Default or Event of Default or (B) at a time when a
         Funding Default exists unless Swing Line Lender has entered into
         arrangements satisfactory to it and Company to eliminate Swing Line
         Lender's risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender's participation in
         such Swing Ling Loan, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Swing Line Loans.

                  2.4      ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PURCHASE OF
PARTICIPATIONS THEREIN.

                           (a)      Letters of Credit. During the Revolving
Commitment Period, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Issuing Bank
agrees to issue Letters of Credit for the account of Company in the aggregate
amount up to but not exceeding the Letter of Credit Sublimit at any time
outstanding; provided, (i) each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in
Dollars; (ii) the stated amount of each Letter of Credit shall not be less than
$50,000 or such lesser amount as is acceptable to Issuing Bank; (iii) after
giving

                                      S-53
<PAGE>

effect to such issuance, in no event shall the Total Utilization of Revolving
Commitments exceed (1) the aggregate amount of all Revolving Commitments then in
effect or (2) the Maximum Revolving Credit Amount then in effect; (iv) after
giving effect to such issuance, in no event shall the Letter of Credit Usage
exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect; (v) in no event shall any
Letter of Credit have an expiration date later than the earlier of (1) the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date and (2) the date which is one year from
the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit; (vi) in no event shall any Letter
of Credit be issued if, after giving effect to the issuance thereof, the Total
Utilization of Commitments exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect. Subject to
the foregoing, Issuing Bank may agree that a Letter of Credit will automatically
be extended for one or more successive periods not to exceed one year each,
unless Issuing Bank elects not to extend for any such additional period;
provided, Issuing Bank shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Requisite Lenders, extend any such Letter of Credit if it has received written
notice that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time
Issuing Bank must elect to allow such extension; provided, further, in the event
a Funding Default exists, Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue any Letter
of Credit unless Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it
and Company to eliminate Issuing Bank's risk with respect to the participation
in Letters of Credit of the Defaulting Lender, including by cash collateralizing
such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Usage.

                           (b)      Notice of Issuance. Whenever Company desires
the issuance of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent an
Issuance Notice no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three (3)
Business Days or such shorter period as may be agreed to by Issuing Bank in any
particular instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. Upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3.2, Issuing Bank
shall issue the requested Letter of Credit only in accordance with Issuing
Bank's standard operating procedures. Upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit
or amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify each Lender of such issuance, which notice shall be accompanied by a copy
of such Letter of Credit or amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit and
the amount of such Lender's respective participation in such Letter of Credit
pursuant to Section 2.4(e).

                           (c)      Responsibility of Issuing Bank With Respect
to Requests for Drawings and Payments. In determining whether to honor any
drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, Issuing Bank
shall be responsible only to examine the documents delivered under such Letter
of Credit with reasonable care so as to ascertain whether they appear on their
face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.
As between Company and Issuing Bank, Company assumes all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing Bank, by the
respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (i) the
form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;
(ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or

                                      S-54
<PAGE>

assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the
rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which
may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions
required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions,
interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail,
cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v)
errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing
under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of Issuing Bank, including any Governmental Acts;
none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of
Issuing Bank's rights or powers hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing and in
furtherance thereof, any action taken or omitted by Issuing Bank under or in
connection with the Letters of Credit or any documents and certificates
delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not give rise to
any liability on the part of Issuing Bank to Company. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 2.4(c), Company shall retain any and
all rights it may have against Issuing Bank for any liability arising solely out
of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank.

                           (d)      Reimbursement by Company of Amounts Drawn or
Paid Under Letters of Credit. In the event Issuing Bank has determined to honor
a drawing under a Letter of Credit, it shall immediately notify Company and
Administrative Agent, and Company shall reimburse Issuing Bank on or before the
Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored
(the "REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal
to the amount of such honored drawing; provided, anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Company shall have notified
Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time)
on the date such drawing is honored that Company intends to reimburse Issuing
Bank for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds
of Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely Funding
Notice to Administrative Agent requesting Lenders to make Revolving Loans that
are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars equal to
the amount of such honored drawing, and (ii) subject to satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions specified in Section 3.2, Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement
Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in the amount of such
honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by
Administrative Agent to reimburse Issuing Bank for the amount of such honored
drawing; and provided further, if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are
not received by Issuing Bank on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the
amount of such honored drawing, Company shall reimburse Issuing Bank, on demand,
in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of the amount of such honored
drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so
received. Nothing in this Section 2.4(d) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and conditions set
forth herein, and Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against
any Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender to make such Revolving
Loans under this Section 2.4(d).

<PAGE>

                           (e)      Lenders' Purchase of Participations in
Letters of Credit. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender having a Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have purchased, and
hereby agrees to irrevocably purchase, from Issuing Bank a participation in such
Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share (with respect to the Revolving Commitments) of the
maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn
thereunder. In the event that Company shall fail for any reason to reimburse
Issuing Bank as provided in Section 2.4(d), Issuing Bank shall promptly notify
each Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such
Lender's respective participation therein based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of the Revolving Commitments. Each Lender shall make available to Issuing Bank
an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same day
funds, at the office of Issuing Bank specified in such notice (provided Issuing
Bank shall have given such notice by 10:00 a.m. (New York City time)), not later
than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first business day (under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which such office of Issuing Bank is located) after the
date notified by Issuing Bank. In the event that any Lender fails to make
available to Issuing Bank on such business day the amount of such Lender's
participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 2.4(e),
Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender
together with interest thereon for three Business Days at the rate customarily
used by Issuing Bank for the correction of errors among banks and thereafter at
the Base Rate. Nothing in this Section 2.4(e) shall be deemed to prejudice the
right of any Lender to recover from Issuing Bank any amounts made available by
such Lender to Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section in the event that it is
determined that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit in respect of
which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of Issuing Bank. In the event Issuing Bank shall have
been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.4(e) for all or any
portion of any drawing honored by Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit, such
Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender which has paid all amounts payable
by it under this Section 2.4(e) with respect to such honored drawing such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by Issuing Bank
from Company in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such payments are
received. Any such distribution shall be made to a Lender at its primary address
set forth below its name on Appendix B or at such other address as such Lender
may request.

                           (f)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of
Company to reimburse Issuing Bank for drawings honored under the Letters of
Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving Loans made by Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.4(d) and the obligations of Lenders under Section 2.4(e) shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms hereof under all circumstances including any of the following
circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which
Company or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such transferee
may be acting), Issuing Bank, Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a
Lender, against Company, whether in connection herewith, the transactions
contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying
transaction between Company or one of its

                                      S-56
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);
(iii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving
to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iv) payment by
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
document which does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit; (v) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (vi) any breach hereof or any other Credit Document by any party
thereto; (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; or (viii) the fact that an Event of Default or
a Default shall have occurred and be continuing; provided, in each case, that
payment by Issuing Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit shall not have
constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank under the
circumstances in question.

                           (g)      Indemnification. Without duplication of any
obligation of Company under Section 10.2 or 10.3, in addition to amounts payable
as provided herein, Company hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
harmless Issuing Bank from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable and
documented fees and out-of-pocket disbursements of counsel) which Issuing Bank
may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the
issuance of any Letter of Credit by Issuing Bank, other than as a result of (1)
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Bank or (2) the wrongful
dishonor by Issuing Bank of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of
Credit issued by it, or (ii) the failure of Issuing Bank to honor a drawing
under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any Governmental Act.

                  2.5      PRO RATA SHARES; AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

                           (a)      Pro Rata Shares. All Loans shall be made,
and all participations purchased, by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately
to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender shall be
responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender's
obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation
required hereby nor shall any Term Loan Commitment or any Revolving Commitment
of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other
Lender in such other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or
purchase a participation required hereby.

                           (b)      Availability of Funds. Unless Administrative
Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable Credit Date
that such Lender does not intend to make available to Administrative Agent the
amount of such Lender's Loan requested on such Credit Date, Administrative Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to Administrative
Agent on such Credit Date and Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion,
but shall not be obligated to, make available to Company a corresponding amount
on such Credit Date. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to Administrative Agent by such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from such Credit

                                      S-57
<PAGE>

Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the
customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the correction of errors among
banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such Lender
does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's
demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Company and Company
shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together
with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until the date such
amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the rate payable hereunder for Base
Rate Loans for such Class of Loans. Nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall be
deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Term Loan
Commitments and Revolving Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that
Company may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender
hereunder.

                  2.6      USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Term Loan made
on the Closing Date shall be applied by Company to fund its obligations under
the Plan of Reorganization. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans or Swing Line
Loans made, and Letters of Credit issued, on or after the Closing Date shall be
applied by Company for general corporate purposes of Company and its
Subsidiaries, including working capital and Permitted Acquisitions; provided
that no more than $35,000,000 of borrowings under the Revolving Facility may be
used to finance Permitted Acquisitions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Letters of Credit may, among other things, be issued for purposes of
replacing or backing any letters of credit previously issued under the DIP
Facilities or under the prepetition syndicated credit facilities of Company and
Mariner Health Group, Inc to the extent consistent with the Plan of
Reorganization. No portion of the proceeds of any Credit Extension shall be used
in any manner that causes or might cause such Credit Extension or the
application of such proceeds to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation
X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other
regulation thereof or to violate the Exchange Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that a portion of
the proceeds of the Term Loan is being used, directly or indirectly, to
refinance prepetition Indebtedness of the Company relating to the Health Care
Facility known as Superior Woods in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and to the Health Care
Facilities operated by the PHCMI Debtors.

                  2.7      EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REGISTER; LENDERS' BOOKS AND
RECORDS; NOTES.

                           (a)      Lenders' Evidence of Debt. Each Lender shall
maintain on its internal records an account or accounts evidencing the
Indebtedness of Company to such Lender, including the amounts of the Loans made
by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Any such recordation
shall be conclusive and binding on Company, absent manifest error; provided,
failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall
not affect any Lender's Revolving Commitments or Company's Obligations in
respect of any applicable Loans; and provided further, in the event of any
inconsistency between the Register and any Lender's records, absent manifest
error the recordations in the Register shall govern.

                           (b)      Register. Administrative Agent shall
maintain at its Principal Office a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of Lenders and the Revolving Commitments and Loans of each Lender from
time to time (the "REGISTER"). The Register shall be available for inspection by
Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the
Revolving Commitments and the Loans, and each repayment or prepayment in respect
of the principal amount of the Loans, and any such recordation shall be
conclusive and binding on Company and each Lender, absent manifest error;
provided, failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Revolving Commitments or Company's
Obligations in respect of any Loan. Company hereby designates Administrative
Agent to serve as Company's agent solely for purposes of maintaining the
Register as provided in this Section 2.7, and Company hereby agrees that, to the
extent Administrative Agent serves in such capacity, Administrative Agent and
its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates shall constitute
"INDEMNITEES."

                           (c)      Notes. If so requested by any Lender by
written notice to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, or at any time thereafter, Company
shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so
specified in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender
pursuant to Section 10.6) on the Closing Date (or, if such notice is delivered
after the Closing Date, promptly after Company's receipt of such notice) a Note
or Notes to evidence such Lender's Term Loan, Revolving Loan or Swing Line Loan,
as the case may be.

                  2.8      INTEREST ON LOANS.

                           (a)      Except as otherwise set forth herein, each
Class of Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from
the date made through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof
as follows:

                                    (i)      in the case of Revolving Loans:

                                             (1)      if a Base Rate Loan, at
         the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; or

                                             (2)      if a Eurodollar Rate Loan,
         at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin;

                                    (ii)     in the case of Swing Line Loans, at
         the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and

                                    (iii)    in the case of Term Loans:

                                             (1)      if a Base Rate Loan, at
         the Base Rate plus 2.25% per annum; or

                                      S-59
<PAGE>

                                             (2)      if a Eurodollar Rate Loan,
         at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 3.25% per annum.

                                    (iv)     In the event the Company shall not
         have obtained prior to the Closing Date a minimum senior secured credit
         rating of B1 from Moody's and B+ from S&P, the rate of interest with
         respect to any Class of Loan otherwise calculated in accordance with
         this Section 2.8(a) shall be increased) by 0.25% per annum from the
         Closing Date until such time as both such ratings shall have been
         obtained.

                           (b)      The basis for determining the rate of
interest with respect to any Loan (except a Swing Line Loan which can be made
and maintained as Base Rate Loans only), and the Interest Period with respect to
any Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be selected by Company and notified to
Administrative Agent and Lenders pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, provided that the Term Loans
initially shall be made as Base Rate Loans and until a date which is at least
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the Term Loans shall be maintained as
either (y) Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period of no longer than one
month or (z) Base Rate Loans. If on any day a Loan is outstanding with respect
to which a Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice has not been
delivered to Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof specifying
the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day
such Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.

                           (c)      In connection with Eurodollar Rate Loans
there shall be no more than seven (7) Interest Periods outstanding at any time.
In the event Company fails to specify between a Base Rate Loan or a Eurodollar
Rate Loan in the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice,
such Loan (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Rate Loan) will be automatically
converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then-current Interest
Period for such Loan (or if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan will remain as, or
(if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan). In the event
Company fails to specify an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the
applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, Company shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month. As soon as practicable
after 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date,
Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that
shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then
being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give
notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and
each Lender.

                           (d)      Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(a)
shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans on the basis of a 365-day
or 366-day year, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any
Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period
applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate

                                      S-60
<PAGE>

Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such
Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be
included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an
Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan
being converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base
Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded;
provided, if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's
interest shall be paid on that Loan.

                           (e)      Except as otherwise set forth herein,
interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to (i) each Interest
Payment Date applicable to that Loan; (ii) any prepayment of that Loan, whether
voluntary or mandatory, to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid; and
(iii) at maturity, including final maturity; provided, however, with respect to
any voluntary prepayment of a Base Rate Loan, accrued interest shall instead be
payable on the applicable Interest Payment Date.

                           (f)      Company agrees to pay to Issuing Bank, with
respect to drawings honored under any Letter of Credit, interest on the amount
paid by Issuing Bank in respect of each such honored drawing from the date such
drawing is honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by or on
behalf of Company at a rate equal to (i) for the period from the date such
drawing is honored to but excluding the applicable Reimbursement Date, the rate
of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans that are
Base Rate Loans, and (ii) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of
the rate of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans
that are Base Rate Loans.

                           (g)      Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(f)
shall be computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues, and shall be payable on
demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing under
a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. Promptly upon receipt by Issuing Bank
of any payment of interest pursuant to Section 2.8(f), Issuing Bank shall
distribute to each Lender, out of the interest received by Issuing Bank in
respect of the period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the
date on which Issuing Bank is reimbursed for the amount of such drawing
(including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans),
the amount that such Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of
the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in respect of such Letter
of Credit for such period if no drawing had been honored under such Letter of
Credit. In the event Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by Lenders for all
or any portion of such honored drawing, Issuing Bank shall distribute to each
Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under Section 2.4(e) with
respect to such honored drawing such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest
received by Issuing Bank in respect of that portion of such honored drawing so
reimbursed by Lenders for the period from the date on which Issuing Bank was so
reimbursed by Lenders to but excluding the date on which such portion of such
honored drawing is reimbursed by Company.

                  2.9      CONVERSION/CONTINUATION.

                                      S-61
<PAGE>

                           (a)      Subject to Section 2.18 and so long as no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing, Company
shall have the option:

                                    (i)      to convert at any time all or any
         part of any Term Loan or Revolving Loan equal to $5,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount from one Type
         of Loan to another Type of Loan; provided, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may
         only be converted on the expiration of the Interest Period applicable
         to such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless Company shall pay all amounts due
         under Section 2.18 in connection with any such conversion; or

                                    (ii)     upon the expiration of any Interest
         Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any
         portion of such Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
         $1,000,000 in excess of that amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan.

                           (b)      The Company shall deliver a
Conversion/Continuation Notice to Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed
conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least
three Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date (in
the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan).
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Conversion/Continuation Notice for
conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Loans (or telephonic
notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest
Rate Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to effect a conversion or
continuation in accordance therewith.

                  2.10 DEFAULT INTEREST. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of (i) an Event of Default under Section 8.1(a), the principal
amount of all Loans and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest
payments on the Loans and any fees or other amounts owed hereunder not paid when
due, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws)
payable on demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate
otherwise payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans and (ii) at any time following
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than an
Event of Default under Section 8.1(a)) the Administrative Agent may, and at the
direction of Requisite Lenders shall, declare that the principal amount of all
Loans shall bear interest (retroactively from the occurrence of such Event of
Default and including post petition interest in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate
that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder
for Base Rate Loans; provided, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the
expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in
interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon become
Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate
which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder
for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest
provided for in this Section 2.10 is not a permitted alternative to timely
payment and shall not constitute

                                      S-62
<PAGE>

a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or
remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                  2.11     FEES.

                           (a)      Company agrees to pay to Lenders having

         0.250% per annum), times the average aggregate daily maximum amount
         available to be drawn (and then undrawn) under all Letters of Credit

         such charges and as in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment,
         transfer or payment, as the case may be.

                           (c)      All fees referred to in Section 2.11(a) and

in each case given to Administrative Agent or Swing Line Lender, as the case may
be, by 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date required and, if given by
telephone, promptly confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent (and
Administrative Agent will promptly transmit such telephonic or original notice
for Term Loan or Revolving Loans, as the case may be, by telefacsimile or
telephone to each Lender) or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. Upon the
giving of any such notice, the principal amount of the Loans specified in such

                           (b)      Voluntary Commitment Reductions.

                                    (i)      Company may, upon not less than
         three Business Days' prior written or telephonic notice confirmed in
         writing to Administrative Agent (which original written or telephonic
         notice Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by telefacsimile or
         telephone to each applicable Lender), at any time and from time to time
         terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part, without premium or
         penalty, the Revolving Commitments in an amount up to the amount by
         which the Revolving Commitments exceed the Total Utilization of
         Revolving Commitments at the time of such proposed termination or
         reduction; provided, any such partial reduction of the Revolving
         Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $2,500,000 in excess of that amount.

                                    (ii)     Company's notice to Administrative
         Agent shall designate the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such
         termination or reduction and the amount of any partial reduction, and
         such termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be
         effective on the date specified in Company's notice and shall reduce
         the Revolving Commitment of each Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata
         Share thereof.

                  2.14     MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS/COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS.

         Business Day following the date of receipt by Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries of any Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Company shall prepay the
         Loans and/or the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced as
         set forth in Section 2.15(b) in an aggregate amount equal to such

                                      S-66
<PAGE>

Net Asset Sale Proceeds; provided, (i) so long as no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) to the extent that aggregate Net
Asset Sale Proceeds allocated for investment pursuant to this clause (ii) but
not yet so reinvested do not exceed $5,000,000, Company shall have the option,
directly or through one or more of its Guarantor Subsidiaries, to invest Net
Asset Sale Proceeds within one hundred eighty (180) days of receipt thereof in
long-term useful assets of the general type used in the business of Company and
its Guarantor Subsidiaries (provided that "long-term" assets for such purpose
shall mean any property having a remaining useful life of at least 5 years);
provided further, pending any such investment all such Net Asset Sale Proceeds
shall be applied to prepay Revolving Loans to the extent outstanding on the date
of such Asset Sale (without a reduction in Revolving Commitments).

                           (b)      Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds. No later
than the first Business Day following the date of receipt by Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or Joint Collateral Agent as loss payee, of any Net
Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds on account of any separate loss of any property
or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess of $2,000,000, Company
shall prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently
reduced as set forth in Section 2.15(b) in an aggregate amount equal to such Net
Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds; provided, (i) so long as no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) Company shall have the
option, directly or through one or more of its Subsidiaries to invest such Net
Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds within three hundred-sixty (360) days of receipt
thereof in the repair, restoration or replacement of the applicable assets
thereof or in other long term useful assets of the general type used in the
business of Company and its Subsidiaries (provided that "long-term" assets for
such purpose shall mean any property having a remaining useful life of at least
5 years), provided further, pending any such investment all such Net
Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be applied to prepay
Revolving Loans to the extent outstanding on the date of such Asset Sale
(without a reduction in Revolving Commitments) or, in the case of proceeds
arising in connection with a Health Care Facility subject to a Mortgage Loan or
Lease which prohibits such prepayment, shall be paid into a restricted account
for use as required by the applicable Mortgage Loan documents or lease, subject
to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Monitoring Agent).

                           (c)      Issuance of Equity Securities. At any time
when the Total Debt Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.0:1.0, on the date of
receipt by Company of any Cash proceeds from a capital contribution to, or the
issuance of any Capital Stock of, Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
pursuant to any employee stock or stock option compensation plan), Company shall
prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced
as set forth in Section 2.15(b) in an aggregate amount equal to 75.0% of such
proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable
costs and expenses associated therewith, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses.

                           (d)      Issuance of Debt. On the second Business Day
after the date of receipt by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Cash
proceeds from incurrence of any Indebtedness of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than with

                                      S-67
<PAGE>

respect to any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to Section 6.1,
including any Refinancing Notes), Company shall prepay the Loans and/or the
Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced as set forth in Section
2.15(b) in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such proceeds, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable costs and expenses
associated therewith, including reasonable legal fees and expenses.

                           (e)      Consolidated Excess Cash Flow. In the event
that there shall be Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for any Fiscal Year
(commencing with Fiscal Year 2002), Company shall, on the earlier of the date on
which the Company's annual Compliance Certificate is delivered, or is required
to be delivered, prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Commitments shall be
permanently reduced as set forth in Section 2.15(b) in an aggregate amount equal
to 75.0% of such Consolidated Excess Cash Flow.

                           (f)      Prepayments Relating to the Borrowing Base.
Company shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans (and after all Revolving Loans
have been repaid, deposit in a collateral account (subject to arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) same day funds in an amount
equal to the Letter of Credit Usage, if any, until such time as the Letters of
Credit shall have been terminated and the Letter of Credit Usage has been
reduced to zero or until no payment is otherwise required under this clause (f))
in such amounts as shall be necessary so that at all times the Total Utilization
of Commitments shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect. After giving
effect to such prepayment of Revolving Loans, to the extent that the Total
Utilization of Commitments still exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Company will
immediately prepay Term Loans to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess
(the "DEFICIENCY AMOUNT"), or (provided no Default or Event of Default exists
and is continuing) at the election of the Company, at any time following
establishment of the Borrowing Base Deficiency pursuant to Section 9.9, deposit
Dollars in the Borrowing Base Deficiency Cash Collateral Account in an amount
equal to the Deficiency Amount.

                           (g)      Revolving Loans and Swing Loans. Company
shall from time to time prepay first, the Swing Line Loans, and second, the
Revolving Loans to the extent necessary so that the Total Utilization of
Revolving Commitments shall not at any time exceed the Revolving Commitments
then in effect.

                           (h)      Prepayment Certificate. Concurrently with
any prepayment of the Loans and/or reduction of the Revolving Commitments
pursuant to Sections 2.14(a) through 2.14(e), Company shall deliver to
Administrative Agent a certificate of an Authorized Officer demonstrating the
calculation of the amount of the applicable net proceeds or Consolidated Excess
Cash Flow, as the case may be. In the event that Company shall subsequently
determine that the actual amount received exceeded the amount set forth in such
certificate, Company shall promptly make an additional prepayment of the Loans
and/or the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an amount equal
to such excess, and Company shall concurrently therewith deliver to
Administrative Agent a certificate of an Authorized Officer demonstrating the
derivation of such excess.

                  2.15     APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS/REDUCTIONS.

                           (a)      Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type
of Loans. Any prepayment of any Loan pursuant to Section 2.13(a) shall be
applied as specified by Company in the applicable notice of prepayment;
provided, in the event Company fails to specify the Loans to which any such
prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied as follows:

                  FIRST, to repay outstanding Swing Line Loans to the full
                  extent thereof;

                  SECOND, to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full
                  extent thereof; and

                  THIRD, to prepay the Term Loans to the full extent thereof.

                  Any prepayment of any Term Loan pursuant to Section 2.13(a)
shall be further applied to reduce the scheduled remaining Installments of
principal on such Term Loan in inverse order of maturity.

                           (b)      Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type
of Loans.

                                    (i)      Any amount required to be paid
         pursuant to Sections 2.14(a) through 2.14(e) shall be applied as
         follows:

                  FIRST, to prepay Term Loans on a pro rata basis applied on a
                  pro rata basis and reduce the remaining scheduled Installments
                  in inverse order of maturity;

                  SECOND, to prepay the Swing Line Loans to the full extent
                  thereof and to permanently reduce the Revolving Commitments by
                  the amount of such prepayment;

                  THIRD, to prepay the Revolving Loans to the full extent
                  thereof and to further permanently reduce the Revolving
                  Commitments by the amount of such prepayment;

                  FOURTH, to prepay outstanding reimbursement obligations with
                  respect to Letters of Credit and to further permanently reduce
                  the Revolving Loan Commitments by the amount of such
                  prepayment;

                  FIFTH, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit and to further
                  permanently reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments by the
                  amount of such cash collateralization; and

                  SIXTH, to repay any other outstanding Obligations.

                                    (ii)     Any amount required to be paid
         pursuant to Section 2.14 (f) shall be applied, first, to the prepayment
         of Revolving Loans (without

                                      S-69
<PAGE>

         reduction of the Revolving Commitments) outstanding on such date, and,
         second, to the prepayment of Term Loans or otherwise as provided in
         Section 2.14(f). Each such prepayment of the Term Loans shall be
         applied to reduce scheduled Installments in inverse order of maturity
         and may not be reborrowed.

                                    (iii)    If a Default or an Event of Default
         has occurred and is then continuing, at any time a prepayment is
         required under Section 2.15(b)(i) or 2.15(b)(ii), then such prepayment
         shall be applied to the outstanding principal balance (in inverse order
         of maturity in the case of Term Loans) of Term Loans and Revolving
         Loans ratably to each Class of Loans in accordance with each Lender's
         proportionate share of each Class of such Loans.

                                    (iv)     All prepayments of Loans under this
         Section 2.15(b) shall, as regards a Type of Loan, be applied first to
         Base Rate Loans, and subject to Section 2.15(b)(v) hereof, then to
         Eurodollar Loans in the order of the scheduled expiry of Interest
         Periods with respect thereto (i.e. those Eurodollar Loans with Interest
         Periods which end sooner would be paid before those with Interest
         Periods which end later).

                                    (v)      If on any day on which Loans would
         otherwise be required to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.15,
         (each a "PREPAYMENT DATE"), the amount of such required prepayment
         exceeds the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Base Rate
         Loans which are of the Class required to be prepaid, and no Default or
         Event of Default exists or is continuing, then on such Prepayment Date,
         then, at any time following the establishment of the Breakage Cost Cash
         Collateral Account pursuant to Section 9.9, at the election of Company,
         (i) Company shall deposit Dollars into the Breakage Cost Cash
         Collateral Account in an amount equal to such excess, and only the
         outstanding Base Rate Loans which are of the Class required to be
         prepaid shall be required to be prepaid on such Prepayment Date and
         (ii) on the last day of each Interest Period after such Prepayment Date
         in effect with respect to a Eurodollar Loan which is of the Class
         required to be prepaid, the Administrative Agent is irrevocably
         authorized and directed to apply funds from the Breakage Cost Cash
         Collateral Account (and liquidate investments held in the Breakage Cost
         Cash Collateral Account as necessary) to prepay such Eurodollar Loans
         for which the Interest Period is then ending to the extent funds are
         available in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account.

                                    (vi)     The Administrative Agent is hereby
         irrevocably authorized and directed to apply all funds from the
         Borrowing Base Deficiency Cash Collateral Account deposited therein
         pursuant to Section 2.14(f) (and liquidate investments held in such
         account as necessary) to prepay Term Loans, in each case subject to
         Section 2.18, if (i) at any time, requested in writing by the Company,
         or (ii) following the making of a deposit in an amount equal to the
         Deficiency Amount, the next Borrowing Base Certificate required to be
         delivered hereunder does not then evidence a Borrowing Base in excess
         of the then Total Utilization of Commitments.

                  2.16     GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS.

                           (a)      All payments by Company of principal,
interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in Dollars in same day funds,
without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition,
and delivered to Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the date due at the Administrative Agent's Principal Office for the
account of Lenders; funds received by Administrative Agent after that time on
such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by Company on the next
succeeding Business Day.

                           (b)      All payments in respect of the principal
amount of any Loan (other than voluntary prepayments of Revolving Loans) shall
include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or
prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of
any Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan)
shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal.

                           (c)      Administrative Agent shall promptly
distribute to each Lender at such address as such Lender shall indicate in
writing, such Lender's applicable Pro Rata Share of all payments and prepayments
of principal and interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due
thereto, including, without limitation, all fees payable with respect thereto,
to the extent received by Administrative Agent.

                           (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
hereof, if any Conversion/Continuation Notice is withdrawn as to any Affected
Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata
Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect
thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter.

                           (e)      Subject to the provisos set forth in the
definition of "INTEREST PERIOD", whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall
be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the
Revolving Commitment fees hereunder.

                           (f)      Company hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to charge any of Company's accounts with the Administrative Agent in order
to cause timely payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal,
interest, fees and expenses and other Obligations due and payable hereunder
(subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for that purpose),
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Company of each occasion on which
Administrative Agent so charges any of Company's accounts, including the amount
of such charge and how such amounts were applied to the Obligations.

                           (g)      Administrative Agent shall deem any payment
by or on behalf of Company hereunder that is not made in same day funds prior to
12:00 p.m. (New York City time) to be a non-conforming payment. Any such payment
shall not be

                                      S-71
<PAGE>

deemed to have been received by Administrative Agent until the later of (I) the
time such funds become available funds, and (ii) the applicable next Business
Day. Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic notice to Company and
each applicable Lender (confirmed in writing) if any payment is non-conforming.
Any non-conforming payment may constitute or become a Default or Event of
Default in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1(a). Interest shall continue
to accrue on any principal as to which a non-conforming payment is made until
such funds become available funds (but in no event less than the period from the
date of such payment to the next succeeding applicable Business Day) at the rate
determined pursuant to Section 2.10 from the date such amount was due and
payable until the date such amount is paid in full.

                           (h)      If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and not otherwise been waived, and the maturity of the Obligations shall have
been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1, all payments or proceeds received by
Agents hereunder in respect of any of the Obligations, shall be applied in
compliance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
application arrangements described in Section 9.10.

                  2.17     RATABLE SHARING. Lenders hereby agree among
themselves that, except as may otherwise be provided in the Collateral Documents
with respect to amounts realized from the exercise of rights with respect to
Liens on the Collateral, if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment
(other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with
the terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's
lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under
the Credit Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit
treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or
reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest,
amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due
and owing to such Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
(collectively, the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than
the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts
Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater
payment shall (a) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the
receipt of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase
participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a
participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of
such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such
recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion
to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided, if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or
otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for
such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. Company expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder with respect
thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation
held by that holder.

                  2.18     MAKING OR MAINTAINING EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

                           (a)      Inability to Determine Applicable Interest
Rate. In the event that Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar
Rate Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank
market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate
applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender
of such determination, whereupon (I) no Loans may be made as, or converted to,
Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative Agent notifies Company
and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist,
and (ii) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by Company
with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall
be deemed to be rescinded by Company.

                           (b)      Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar
Rate Loans. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined
(which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto but shall be made only after consultation with Company and Administrative
Agent) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
(I) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith
with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or
would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith
would not be unlawful), or (ii) has become impracticable, as a result of
contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and adversely
affect the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in that
market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "AFFECTED LENDER"
and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination (which
notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).
Thereafter (1) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to
convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice
shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (2) to the extent such determination
by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by
Company pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the
Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or continue such Loan as or convert
such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (3) the Affected Lender's
obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the "AFFECTED
LOANS") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when
required by law, and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into
Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates
to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Funding
Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, Company shall have the option,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.18(c), to rescind such Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by giving notice (by
telefacsimile or by

                                      S-73
<PAGE>

telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of such rescission on
the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as
described above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, nothing in this Section 2.18(b) shall affect the obligation of any
Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert
Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with the terms hereof.

                           (c)      Compensation for Breakage or
Non-Commencement of Interest Periods. Company shall compensate each Lender, upon
written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for
requesting such amounts), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including
any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or
carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by
such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds
but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if
for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a borrowing of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Funding
Notice or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation
of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a
Conversion/Continuation Notice or a telephonic request for conversion or
continuation; (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment or any
conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to the
last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan; or (iii) if any
prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date specified
in a notice of prepayment given by Company.

                           (d)      Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender
may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of
any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of such Lender.

                           (e)      Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar
Rate Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section
2.18 and under Section 2.19 shall be made as though such Lender had actually
funded each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a
Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (I)
of the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount
of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant
Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an
offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United
States of America; provided, however, each Lender may fund each of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions
shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under
this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19.

                  2.19     INCREASED COSTS; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                           (a)      Compensation For Increased Costs and Taxes.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.20 (which shall be controlling with
respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (which
term shall include Issuing Bank for

                                      S-74
<PAGE>

purposes of this Section 2.19(a)) shall determine (which determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
change therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof
(including the introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order), or any determination of a court or governmental authority,
in each case that becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such
Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date
hereof by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law): (I) subjects such Lender (or its
applicable lending office) to any additional Tax (other than any Tax on the
overall net income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any of the
other Credit Documents or any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or any
payments to such Lender (or its applicable lending office) of principal,
interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder; (ii) imposes, modifies or
holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental,
special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or
similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or
any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any
such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that
are reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes
any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting
such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations hereunder or
the London interbank market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining
Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender
(or its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case,
Company shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the statement
referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form
of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or
otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) to the extent
such increased costs of capital are due to changes in applicable law or
regulatory policy first occurring after the execution of the Commitment Letter,
as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or
reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver
to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed
to such Lender under this Section 2.19(a), which statement shall be conclusive
and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

                           (b)      Capital Adequacy Adjustment. In the event
that any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes of this
Section 2.19(b)) shall have determined that the adoption, effectiveness,
phase-in or applicability after the Closing Date of any law, rule or regulation
(or any provision thereof) regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its applicable lending
office) with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date
hereof regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the

                                      S-75
<PAGE>

effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to,
such Lender's Loans or Revolving Commitments or Letters of Credit, or
participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans
or the Letters of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such
controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into
consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with
regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within five (5) Business
Days after receipt by Company from such Lender of the statement referred to in
the next sentence, Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an
after-tax basis for such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a
copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to Lender under
this Section 2.19(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties hereto absent manifest error.

                  2.20     TAXES; WITHHOLDING, ETC.

                           (a)      Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums
payable by any Credit Party hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall
(except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without
any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax (other than a Tax on the
overall net income of any Lender or a franchise Tax) imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by or within the United States of America or any political
subdivision in or of the United States of America or any other jurisdiction from
or to which a payment is made by or on behalf of any Credit Party or by any
federation or organization of which the United States of America or any such
jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment.

                           (b)      Withholding of Taxes. If any Credit Party or
any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on
account of any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to
Administrative Agent or any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for
purposes of this Section 2.20(b)) under any of the Credit Documents: (i) Company
shall notify Administrative Agent of any such requirement or any change in any
such requirement as soon as Company becomes aware of it; (ii) Company shall pay
any such Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to
be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on any Credit Party) for its own
account or (if that liability is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender,
as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of Administrative Agent or such
Lender; (iii) the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the
relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the
extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding
or payment, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on
the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such
deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and (iv) within thirty
(30) days after paying any sum from which it is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding, and within thirty (30) days after the due date of
payment of any Tax which it is required by clause (ii) above to pay, Company
shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other
affected

                                      S-76
<PAGE>

parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof
to the relevant taxing or other authority; provided, no such additional amount
shall be required to be paid to any Lender under clause (iii) above except to
the extent that any change after the date hereof (in the case of each Lender
listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or after the effective
date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender
(in the case of each other Lender) in any such requirement for a deduction,
withholding or payment as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in
the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment from that in effect at the
date hereof or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, in
respect of payments to such Lender.

                           (c)      Evidence of Exemption From U.S. Withholding
Tax. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such term is defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (a "NON-US LENDER") shall deliver to Administrative Agent for
transmission to Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each
Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior
to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender
(in the case of each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary
in the determination of Company or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable
exercise of its discretion), (I) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly
executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the
Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by Company to establish that such
Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest,
fees or other amounts payable under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such
Lender is not a "bank" or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI pursuant to clause (I) above, a Certificate re Non-Bank Status
together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or any
successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such
other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably
requested by Company to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction
or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments
to such Lender of interest payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each
Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with
respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this
Section 2.20(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by
such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in
time or change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall
promptly deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to Company two new
original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or a
Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8, as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by
such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue
Code and reasonably requested by Company to confirm or establish that such
Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to payments to such Lender under the Credit Documents,
or notify Administrative Agent and

                                      S-77
<PAGE>

Company of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other
evidence. Company shall not be required to pay any additional amount to any
Non-US Lender under Section 2.20(b)(iii) if such Lender shall have failed (1) to
deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred to in the second
sentence of this Section 2.20(c), or (2) to notify Administrative Agent and
Company of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other
evidence, as the case may be; provided, if such Lender shall have satisfied the
requirements of the first sentence of this Section 2.20(c) on the Closing Date
or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender,
as applicable, nothing in this last sentence of Section 2.20(c) shall relieve
Company of its obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section
2.19(a) in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law,
treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
withholding as described herein.

                  2.21     OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE. Each Lender (which term shall
include Issuing Bank for purposes of this Section 2.21) agrees that, as promptly
as practicable after the officer of such Lender responsible for administering
its Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of the
occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such
Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive
payments under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, it will, to the extent not
inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal
or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or
maintain its Credit Extensions, including any Affected Loans, through another
office of such Lender, or (b) take such other measures as such Lender may deem
reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such
Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts
which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section
2.19, or 2.20 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender
in its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such
Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through such other office or
in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise
adversely affect such Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or the
interests of such Lender; provided, such Lender will not be obligated to utilize
such other office pursuant to this Section 2.21 unless Company agrees to pay all
incremental expenses incurred by such Lender as a result of utilizing such other
office as described in clause (I) above. A certificate as to the amount of any
such expenses payable by Company pursuant to this Section 2.21 (setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender
to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

                  2.22     DEFAULTING LENDERS. Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender defaults (a "DEFAULTING
LENDER") in its obligation to fund (a "FUNDING DEFAULT") any Revolving Loan or
its portion of any unreimbursed payment under Section 2.3(b)(iv) or 2.4(e) (in
each case, a "DEFAULTED LOAN"), then (a) during any Default Period with respect
to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a
"LENDER" for purposes of voting on any

                                      S-78
<PAGE>

matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers) with respect to any
of the Credit Documents; (b) to the extent permitted by applicable law, until
such time as the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall
have been reduced to zero, (I) any voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loans
shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be
applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had
no Revolving Loans outstanding and the Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting
Lender were zero, and (ii) any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans
shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such mandatory prepayment, be
applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders (but not to the Revolving Loans
of such Defaulting Lender) as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted
Loans of such Defaulting Lender, it being understood and agreed that Company
shall be entitled to retain any portion of any mandatory prepayment of the
Revolving Loans that is not paid to such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of
the operation of the provisions of this clause (b); (c) such Defaulting Lender's
Revolving Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for
purposes of calculating the Revolving Commitment fee payable to Lenders in
respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting
Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any
Revolving Commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.11 with respect to such
Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment in respect of any Default Period with
respect to such Defaulting Lender; and (d) the Total Utilization of Revolving
Commitments as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such
Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans of such Defaulting Lender. No
Revolving Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected,
and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.22, performance by
Company of its obligations hereunder and the other Credit Documents shall not be
excused or otherwise modified as a result of any Funding Default or the
operation of this Section 2.22. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting
Lender under this Section 2.22 are in addition to other rights and remedies
which Company may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any
Funding Default and which Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against
such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default.

                  2.23     REMOVAL OR REPLACEMENT OF A LENDER. Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that: (a) any
Lender (an "INCREASED-COST LENDER") shall give notice to Company that such
Lender is an Affected Lender or that such Lender is entitled to receive payments
under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, the circumstances which have caused such
Lender to be an Affected Lender or which entitle such Lender to receive such
payments shall remain in effect, and such Lender shall fail to withdraw such
notice within five (5) Business Days after Company's request for such
withdrawal; or (b) any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, the Default
Period for such Defaulting Lender shall remain in effect, and such Defaulting
Lender shall fail to cure the default as a result of which it has become a
Defaulting Lender within five (5) Business Days after Company's request that it
cure such default; or (c) in connection with any proposed amendment,
modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the
provisions hereof as contemplated by Section 10.5(b), the consent of Requisite
Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other
Lenders (each a "NON-CONSENTING LENDER") whose consent is required shall not
have been

                                      S-79
<PAGE>

obtained; then, with respect to each such Increased-Cost Lender, Defaulting
Lender or Non-Consenting Lender (the "TERMINATED LENDER"), Company may, by
giving written notice to Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its
election to do so, elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated
Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its
Revolving Commitments, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees (each a
"REPLACEMENT LENDER") in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 and
Terminated Lender shall pay any fees payable thereunder in connection with such
assignment; provided, (1) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement Lender
shall pay to Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal
to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the
Terminated Lender, (B) an amount equal to all unreimbursed drawings that have
been funded by such Terminated Lender, together with all then unpaid interest
with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal to all accrued, but
theretofore unpaid fees owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section
2.11; (2) on the date of such assignment, Company shall pay any amounts payable
to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.18(c), 2.19 or 2.20 or otherwise
as if it were a prepayment; and (3) in the event such Terminated Lender is a
Non-Consenting Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of
such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender was a
Non-Consenting Lender; provided, Company may not make such election with respect
to any Terminated Lender that is also (x) an Issuing Bank unless, prior to the
effectiveness of such election, Company shall have caused each outstanding
Letter of Credit issued thereby to be cancelled and (y) the Collateral
Monitoring Agent, unless a replacement Collateral Monitoring Agent agrees to be
appointed as Collateral Monitoring Agent and assumes the duties and
responsibilities of the Collateral Monitoring Agent hereunder and under the
Credit Documents. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated
Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender's Revolving Commitments, if
any, such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes
hereof; provided, any rights of such Terminated Lender to indemnification
hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

SECTION 3.        CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

                  3.1      CLOSING DATE. The obligation of any Lender to make a
Credit Extension on the Closing Date is subject to the satisfaction, or waiver

third party approvals (including that of the Bankruptcy Court) necessary or
reasonably advisable (in

                                      S-80

Approvals, duly applied for) and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent, and all applicable waiting
periods shall have expired without any action being taken or threatened by any
competent authority, which without limitation, would restrain, prevent or
otherwise impose adverse conditions on the transactions contemplated by the

thereof, and no action, request for stay, petition for review or rehearing,
reconsideration, or appeal with respect to any of the foregoing shall be
pending, and the time for any applicable agency to take action to set aside its

         acknowledged by the Syndication Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent
         that the Confirmation Order entered by the Bankruptcy Court on April 3,
         2002 was in form and substance satisfactory to them); the Confirmation
         Order shall be in full force and effect, shall not have been stayed,
         reversed, vacated or otherwise modified (unless otherwise reasonably
         satisfactory to the Syndication Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent);

         pending in respect of the Confirmation Order or motion to revoke
         confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization, absent the consent of
         Syndication Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent; and, unless
         Syndication Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent in their sole
         discretion shall have otherwise agreed, the time to file any appeal or
         petition for rehearing or certiorari shall have lapsed; and

                                    (iii)    The transactions contemplated by

         that the Company's and each of its Subsidiaries' obligations with
         respect to the DIP Facilities have been terminated and discharged and

                                      S-81
<PAGE>

         than (A) indemnification and reimbursement obligations which may
         survive the Effective Date as general unsecured obligations of Company
         and its Subsidiaries that were debtors in the Cases, and (B) cash
         collateral for outstanding letters of credit issued under the DIP

Issuing Bank to enter into this Agreement and to make each Credit Extension to

understood and agreed that the representations and warranties made on the
Closing Date are deemed to be made concurrently with the consummation of the
Reorganization):

                  4.1      ORGANIZATION; REQUISITE POWER AND AUTHORITY;
QUALIFICATION. Company and each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries (a) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its

requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the
Credit Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (c) is qualified to do business and in good standing
in every jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever necessary to

                  4.2      CAPITAL STOCK AND OWNERSHIP. The Capital Stock of
Company and each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries has been duly authorized and
validly issued and is fully paid and non-assessable. Except as set forth on

right, commitment or other agreement to which Company or any of the Subsidiaries

exchange would require, the issuance by Company or any of the Subsidiaries of
any additional membership interests or other Capital Stock of Company or any of
the Subsidiaries or other Securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase, a membership interest or
other Capital Stock of Company or any of the Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.2

4.2 further correctly sets forth as of the Closing Date the Joint Ventures in
which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has an interest, and the extent of
such interest and the material agreements relating thereto.

                  4.3      DUE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance of the Credit Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of each Credit Party that is a party thereto.

                  4.4      NO CONFLICT. The execution, delivery and performance
by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties and the

will not (a) violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or
regulation applicable to Company or any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries, any of
the Organizational Documents of Company or any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries, or
any order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government binding

otherwise delivered to Joint Collateral Agent for filing and/or recordation, as

the legally valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable

of the periods then ended, subject, in the case of any such unaudited financial

of the Closing Date, except as disclosed on Schedule 4.7 neither Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any contingent liability or liability for taxes,
long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that is not reflected

                  4.9      NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since December 31, 2001,

                                      S-91
<PAGE>

sub-lease relating to a Real Estate Asset listed in clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence is in full force and effect and Company does not

                  4.14     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Facilities or operations are subject to
any outstanding written order, consent decree or settlement agreement with any

or request for information under Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. Section 9604) or any
comparable state law, except as has been disclosed in writing to the
Administrative Agent. There are and, to each of Company's and its Subsidiaries'
knowledge, have been, no conditions, occurrences, or Hazardous Materials

Environmental Claim against Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,

Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to any
Credit Party's knowledge, any predecessor of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has filed any notice under any Environmental Law indicating past or

                                      S-92
<PAGE>

present treatment of Hazardous Materials at any Facility, and none of Company's
or any of its Subsidiaries' operations involves the generation, transportation,
treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste, as defined under 40 C.F.R.
Parts 260-270 or any state equivalent, except as has been disclosed in writing
to the Administrative Agent. Compliance with all current or reasonably
foreseeable future requirements pursuant to or under Environmental Laws could
not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. No event or condition has occurred or is occurring with respect
to Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any Environmental Law, any
Release of Hazardous Materials, or any Hazardous Materials Activity which
individually or in the aggregate has had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  4.15     NO DEFAULTS. Neither Company nor any of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any of its Contractual
Obligations, and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both, could constitute such a default, except where the
consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or defaults, if any, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  4.16     MATERIAL CONTRACTS. Schedule 4.16 contains a true,
correct and complete list of all the Material Contracts in effect on the Closing
Date, and except as described thereon, all such Material Contracts are in full
force and effect and no defaults currently exist thereunder.

                  4.17     MATERIAL REIMBURSEMENTS. (a) Each Credit Party and
each Subsidiary of a Credit Party has obtained and holds in full force and
effect all Reimbursement Approvals necessary to carry on its respective business

obligations in excess of $20,000,000 per annum or (c) likely suffer damages or

         requirements of each such Health Care Permit, and no event has
         occurred, and no condition exists, which, with the giving of notice,
         the passage of time, or both, would constitute a violation thereof,

         received any written notice of any violation of any Requirement of Law,
         (v) no condition exists or event has occurred which in itself or with

         suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or non-renewal of any
         such Health Care Permit, other than those the absence of which could
         not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (vi)
         there is no claim filed with any Governmental Authority of which

         (vii) the continuation, validity and effectiveness of all such Health
         Care Permits will not be adversely affected by the Reorganization or

         reimbursement programs, and any similar state or local
         government-sponsored program, to the extent that the Company or any of
         its Guarantor Subsidiaries has decided to participate in any such
         program, and to receive reimbursement from private and commercial
         payers and health maintenance organizations to the extent applicable
         thereto; and (ii) there are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
         of Company, any proceedings threatened or investigations pending or

                  4.19     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. Neither Company nor any of
the Guarantor Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the Investment Company Act
of 1940 or under any other federal or state statute or regulation which may
limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any
portion of the Obligations unenforceable. Neither Company nor any of the
Guarantor Subsidiaries is a "registered investment company" or a company
"controlled" by a "registered investment company" or a "principal underwriter"
of a "registered investment company" as such terms are defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

                  4.20     MARGIN STOCK. Neither Company nor any of the
Guarantor Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock. No part of the proceeds of the Loans made to such
Credit Party will be used to purchase or carry any such margin stock or to
extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such
margin stock or for any purpose that violates, or is inconsistent with, the
provisions of Regulation T, U or X of said Board of Governors.

                  4.21     EMPLOYEE MATTERS. Neither Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries is engaged in any unfair labor practice that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is (a) no unfair labor
practice complaint pending against Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or to the
best knowledge of Company, threatened against any of them before the National
Labor Relations Board and no grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of
or under any collective bargaining agreement that is so pending against Company
or any of the Subsidiaries or to the best knowledge of Company, threatened
against any of them, (b) no strike or work stoppage in existence or threatened
involving Company or any of the Subsidiaries and (c) to the best knowledge of
Company, no union representation question existing with respect to the employees
of Company or any of the Subsidiaries and, to the best knowledge of Company, no
union organization activity that is taking place, except (with respect to any
matter specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) above, either individually or in the
aggregate) such as is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.21 hereto, there are no collective bargaining
agreements or Multiemployer Plans covering the employees of any Credit Party or
any Subsidiary of a Credit Party and no Credit Party nor any Subsidiary of a
Credit Party has suffered any strikes, walkouts or work stoppages within the
last three (3) years.

                  4.22     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Company, each of the
Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance
with all applicable provisions and requirements of ERISA and the Internal
Revenue Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed all their obligations
under each Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that
such Employee Benefit Plan is so qualified and nothing has occurred subsequent
to the issuance of such determination letter which would cause such Employee
Benefit Plan to lose its qualified status. No liability to the PBGC (other than

                                      S-95
<PAGE>

required premium payments), the Internal Revenue Service, any Employee Benefit
Plan or any trust established under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to
be incurred by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur.
Except to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code
or similar state laws, no Employee Benefit Plan provides health or welfare
benefits (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for any retired or
former employee of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates. The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
each Pension Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates, (determined as of the end of the
most recent plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for
funding purposes in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Pension Plan),
did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Pension Plan.
As of the most recent valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan for which the
actuarial report is available, the potential liability of Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete withdrawal
from such Multiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), when
aggregated with such potential liability for a complete withdrawal from all
Multiemployer Plans, based on information available pursuant to Section 4221(e)
of ERISA. is zero. Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each of their ERISA
Affiliates have complied with the requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with
respect to each Multiemployer Plan and are not in material "default" (as defined
in Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer
Plan.

                  4.23     CERTAIN FEES. No broker's or finder's fee or
commission will be payable with respect hereto or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  4.24     SOLVENCY. Each Credit Party (other than a
Non-Material Guarantor Subsidiary) is and, upon the incurrence of any Obligation
by such Credit Party on any date on which this representation and warranty is
made, will be, Solvent.

                  4.25     RELATED AGREEMENTS.

Administrative Agent and Syndication Agent complete and correct copies of (i)
each Related Agreement and of all exhibits and schedules thereto as of the date

other modification to or waiver of each Related Agreement entered into after the
date hereof.

                           (b)      Representations and Warranties. Except to
the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein or in the schedules hereto, and
subject to the qualifications set forth therein, each of the representations and
warranties given by any Credit Party in any Related Agreement is true and
correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date (or as of any earlier
date to which such representation and warranty specifically relates).
Notwithstanding anything in the Related Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties of each Credit Party set forth in this Section
4.25 (b) shall, solely for purposes hereof, survive the Closing Date for the
benefit of Lenders.

Authorizations and all other authorizations, approvals and consents of any other
Person required by the Related Agreements or the Plan or to consummate the
Reorganization have been obtained and are in full force and effect.

business and the requirements of any permits issued under such Environmental
Laws with respect to any such Real Estate Asset or the operations of Company or
any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries), except such non-compliance that,

this Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any other document, certificate or
statement furnished to any Agent or the Lenders or any of them, by or on behalf

estimates and assumptions believed by Company to be reasonable at the time made,
it being recognized by Lenders that such projections as to future events are not

covered by any such projections may differ from the projected results. There are
no facts known (or which should upon the reasonable exercise of diligence be
known) to Company (other than matters of a general economic nature) that,

Material Adverse Effect and that have not been disclosed herein or in such other
documents, certificates and statements furnished to Lenders for use in

if it is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings timely
instituted and diligently conducted, so long as (a) adequate reserve or other
appropriate provision, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have
been made therefor, and (b) in the case of a charge or claim which has or may
become a Lien against any of the Collateral, such contest proceedings

return with any Person (other than Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

such risks and otherwise on such terms and conditions as shall be customary

applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

and automobile liability insurance under such policies of insurance, with such
insurance companies, in such amounts, with such deductibles, and covering such
risks as are at all times carried or maintained under similar circumstances by
Persons of established reputation of the same or similar size engaged in

Collateral Monitoring Agent and the Administrative Agent. Each such policy of
insurance shall (i) name Joint Collateral Agent, on behalf of Secured Parties
as an additional insured thereunder as its interests may appear, (ii) in the
case of each casualty insurance policy and each physical damage insurance
policy, contain a loss payable clause or endorsement, satisfactory in form and

continuing, to adjust losses and claims with respect to any Collateral or Real
Estate Asset, and as an additional insured for liability insurance, provide
for at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Administrative Agent,
Collateral Monitoring Agent and the Joint Collateral Agent of any modification
or cancellation of such policy, (iii) state that neither the Agents, any of
the Lenders, nor any other Secured Party shall be responsible for premiums,
commissions, club calls, assessments or advances, and (iv) be reasonably
satisfactory in all other respects (including deductibles) to the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Monitoring Agent.

                      (b)    Upon the request of either the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Monitoring Agent, furnish to such Agent, an updated

above and contain signatures of duly authorized representatives of the
insurer, at all times prior to policy termination, cessation or cancellation.

                      (d)    Maintain such other insurance or self-insurance
as may be required by applicable laws or any material Contractual Obligation
to which any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof is a party, and maintain
in respect of the Collateral such other insurance or self-insurance as either
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Monitoring Agent may reasonably
request.

                      (e)    The Credit Parties shall apply all amounts
standing to the credit of the Insurance Concentration Account only: (i) to the
payment of the self-insured retention actually required to be paid in respect
of any insured claim and (in an amount not exceeding 5% of the required
balance of such account in any Fiscal Year) otherwise in respect of costs and
expenses of the Credit Parties which are directly insurance or risk management

<PAGE>




                      (a)    In the event after the Closing Date that any
Person becomes a wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary of Company (other than an
Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary but expressly including each of the
PHCMI Debtors upon prepayment or repayment in full of the Omega Loan), Company
shall (a) promptly cause such Domestic Subsidiary to become a Guarantor
hereunder and a Grantor under the Pledge and Security Agreement by executing
and delivering to Administrative Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent a
Counterpart Agreement, and (b) take all such actions and execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments,
agreements, and certificates as are similar to those described in Sections
3.1(g), 3.1(l), 3.1(m), 3.1(n), and 3.1(r). In the event that any Person
becomes a Foreign Subsidiary of Company (other than an Approved Captive
Insurance Subsidiary), and the ownership interests of such Foreign Subsidiary
are owned by Company or by any wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary thereof,
Company shall, or shall cause such Domestic Subsidiary to, deliver, all such
documents, instruments, agreements, and certificates as are similar to those
described in Sections 3.1(g), and Company shall take, or shall cause such
Domestic Subsidiary to take, all of the actions referred to in Section
3.1(m)(i) necessary to grant and to perfect a First Priority Lien in favor of
Joint Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Secured Parties, under the Pledge
and Security Agreement in such ownership interests, provided that in no event
shall such Domestic Subsidiary be required to pledge ownership interests
exceeding sixty-five percent (65%) of its total ownership interests in such
Foreign Subsidiary. With respect to each such Subsidiary, Company shall
promptly send to Administrative Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent written
notice setting forth with respect to such Person (i) the date on which such
Person became a Subsidiary of Company, and (ii) all of the data required to be
set forth in Schedules 4.1 and 4.2 with respect to all Subsidiaries of
Company; provided, such written notice shall be deemed to supplement Schedule
4.1 and 4.2 for all purposes hereof.

                      (b)    At any time no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company may request in writing that a
Subsidiary be designated by the Administrative Agent, Collateral Monitoring
Agent and the Syndication Agent as an Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary.
Such request shall include all such documents, instruments, agreements, and
certificates as are similar to those described in Sections 3.1(g) and set
forth with respect to such Person (i) the date on which such Person became a
Subsidiary of Company; (ii) the jurisdiction of organization of such Person;
(iii) all of the data required to be set forth in Schedules 4.1 and 4.2 with
respect to all Subsidiaries of Company; (iv) descriptions of any insurance,
reinsurance, insurance fronting arrangements, material contracts and
investments proposed to be entered into by any such Subsidiary. Upon receipt
of such notice, the Administrative Agent and the Syndication may, in their
sole discretion, designate such Person an Approved Captive Insurance
Subsidiary. In no event shall any Person not designated by both of the
Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent be an Approved Captive
Insurance Subsidiary; provided that such written notice shall be deemed to
supplement Schedules 4.1 and 4.2 for all purposes hereof.

               5.11   ADDITIONAL MATERIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS. In the event
that any Credit Party purchases, leases or otherwise acquires a Material Real
Estate Asset or a Real Estate Asset owned on the Closing Date becomes a
Material Real Estate Asset and




                                    S-110
<PAGE>


such interest has not otherwise been made subject to the Lien of the
Collateral Documents in favor of Joint Collateral Agent, for the benefit of
Secured Parties, then contemporaneously with acquiring such Material Real
Estate Asset (or such Real Estate Asset subsequently becoming a Material Real
Estate Asset, such Credit Party shall (a) promptly, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after such purchase, lease or other acquisition, provide
written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Monitoring Agent, setting forth with specificity a description of such
Material Real Estate Asset acquired, a title commitment, a survey (if
available) and such Credit Party's good faith estimate of the current fair
market value of such Material Real Estate Asset and (b) if either such Agent
so requests, the applicable Credit Party shall promptly execute and deliver to
the Joint Collateral Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Monitoring Agent), a
Mortgage and such other documents, instruments as such Persons shall
reasonably request with respect to such Material Real Estate Asset; provided,
however that, in the case of any Leasehold Property, such obligation to
deliver a Mortgage shall be contingent upon such Credit Party's obtaining and
delivering to the Collateral Monitoring Agent a Landlord Consent and Estoppel
and evidence that such Leasehold Property is a Recorded Leasehold Interest and
for which such Credit Party agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain (it being acknowledged and agreed that "commercially reasonable best
efforts" shall not be construed to require the payment by any Credit Party of
any fee or other consideration for such Landlord Consent and Estoppel other
than reimbursement of legal expenses actually incurred by landlords). In
addition to the foregoing, the relevant Credit Party shall, at the request of
Requisite Lenders, deliver, from time to time, to Administrative Agent and
Collateral Monitoring Agent such appraisals as are required by law or
regulation of Real Estate Assets with respect to which Joint Collateral Agent
has been granted a Lien.

               5.12   INTEREST RATE PROTECTION. No later than ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date and at all times thereafter, Company shall
maintain, or caused to be maintained, in effect one or more Interest Rate
Agreements having terms, conditions and tenors, and being otherwise in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Syndication
Agent, to the extent necessary so that until the Term Loan Maturity Date
interest on Indebtedness in a principal amount equal to at least 50.0% of the
total outstanding funded Indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries at any time is effectively fixed or capped at rates which are
reasonably acceptable to the Syndication Agent.

               5.13   OBSERVANCE OF AGREEMENTS.  Each Credit Party shall:

                      (a)    duly observe and perform all material terms and
conditions of any agreement relating to any Material Real Estate Asset, any
Management Agreement or any other agreement which is material to the Credit
Parties taken as a whole and diligently protect and enforce the rights of the
Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries under all such agreements in a manner
consistent with prudent business judgment and subject to the terms and
conditions of such agreements;

                      (b)    promptly provide any Agents copies of any and all
agreements amending, altering, modifying, waiving or supplementing in any
material




                                    S-111
<PAGE>

respect the Rollover Note Indenture, any other Related Agreement and any
Material Contract; and

                      (c)    except where the failure to participate or comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, continue
its participation in all Third Party Payor Arrangements and comply with all
rules, regulations, standard procedures and decrees necessary to constitute
its participation in such Third Party Payor Arrangements and prepare and file
all applicable cost reports with respect to such Third Party Payor
Arrangements.

               5.14   CASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. At all times maintain or cause
to be maintained an integrated cash management system in accordance with
Sections 4.3(b)(ii) and 4.4(c) of the Pledge and Security Agreement and the
following provisions:

                      (a)    Each Credit Party shall at all times maintain in
all material respects their current cash management system as described in
Schedule 4.29 (including, without limitation, the timing and frequency of cash
sweeps and other inter-account transfers described herein) (the "CASH
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM") or cause to be maintained another cash management system
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

                      (b)    So long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Credit Parties shall have free access to the
funds in the Concentration Accounts. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent (for the benefit
of the Secured Parties), subject to applicable law, shall have the right to
direct the Joint Collateral Agent to establish sole dominion and control over
the Concentration Accounts, and the balances in such accounts may be applied
toward the payment of the Obligations in accordance with the provisions hereof
and the Intercreditor Agreement.

               5.15   FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time or from time to time
upon the request of Administrative Agent and Collateral Monitoring Agent, each
Credit Party will, at its expense, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver
such further documents and do such other acts and things as Administrative
Agent or Collateral Monitoring Agent may reasonably request in order to effect
fully the purposes of the Credit Documents. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Credit Party shall take such actions as
Administrative Agent or Collateral Monitoring Agent may reasonably request
from time to time to ensure that the Obligations are guarantied by the
Guarantors and, except as otherwise expressly agreed in the Credit Documents,
are secured by substantially all of the assets of Company, and its Guarantor
Subsidiaries and all of the outstanding Capital Stock of Company and its
Guarantor Subsidiaries (subject to limitations contained in the Credit
Documents with respect to Foreign Subsidiaries).

               5.16   FILING OF AGREEMENT. Unless otherwise consented to by
Agents or Requisite Lenders, within 10 Business Days of the Closing Date,
provided that Company or any of its Subsidiaries is otherwise required to file
periodic reports with the SEC, Company or such Subsidiaries shall file a copy
of this Agreement (but not necessarily the Exhibits or the Schedules) hereto
as a material contract with the SEC.

executed and notarized Mortgage in proper form for recording in all
appropriate places in all appropriate jurisdictions in respect of each
Leasehold Property (other than those in respect of which such has already been
delivered prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.1(l)), it being
acknowledged and agreed that "commercially reasonable best efforts" shall not

of legal expenses actually incurred by landlords.

                      (b)    Promptly following the Closing Date and in any
event within 180 days thereafter, the Company and its Guarantor Subsidiaries
shall have obtained all Restructuring CHOW Approvals necessary or reasonable
advisable (in the Administrative Agent's or Syndication Agent's judgment) in
connection with the confirmation, consummation and implementation of the Plan
of Reorganization provided that failure to obtain any Restructuring CHOW
Approval shall not be deemed to be a failure to comply with this provision to
the extent that the Credit Parties shall have used commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain such Restructuring CHOW Approval and such failure,
either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the above, each applicable
Credit Party will use all its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain
such approvals as promptly as practicable.

                      (c)    Within 45 days following the Closing Date and at

liabilities, claims or assets other then incidental to its existence as a
holding Company.

                      (d)    Each Credit Party shall use all its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain ALTA mortgage title insurance policies

other Lien in respect of such Health Care Facilities.

                      (f)    For the period of 120 days after the Closing

the Closing Date by delivering to the Joint Collateral Agent a completed
Pledge Supplement, substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached to the
Pledge and Security Agreement, together with all Supplements to Schedules
thereto, reflecting such Pledged Stock. Without limitation, following the
Closing Date, no Credit Party shall grant any other Lien in respect of the
Capital Stock in such Joint Ventures.

the meaning of Section 8-106 and 9-106 or 9-104, as applicable, to the UCC);
provided, however, that in the event the such investment account has not been
established and subjected to the Joint Collateral Agent's control within the
time required in this clause (iv), and until such actions have been taken, the
investment of funds in the JPMorgan Concentration Accounts shall be limited to
the investment thereof through a sweep account attached to, and part of, the
JPMorgan Chase Concentration Account that is covered by blocked account
control agreement meeting the requirements of this Agreement and the Pledge
and Security Agreement.

                      (h)    Within 30 days following the Closing Date, each

                      (iii)  To the extent the amount of Consolidated Capital
        Expenditures permitted by the preceding paragraph (i) for any Fiscal
        Year (without regard to any carry-over from a prior Fiscal Year
        pursuant to this paragraph) is in excess of the actual amount of
        Consolidated Capital Expenditures for such period, the amount of
        permitted Consolidated Capital Expenditures during the immediately
        succeeding Fiscal Year only, shall be increased by the lesser of (A)
        the amount of such excess and (B) the amount equal to 20% of the
        amount of Consolidated Capital Expenditures permitted by such
        paragraph (i) without regard to any carry-over from a prior Fiscal
        Year pursuant to this paragraph) for the period with respect to which
        such excess exists (provided that, for purposes of determining the
        portion of any such excess from the Closing Date through December 31,
        2002 which may be carried over into Fiscal Year 2003, the amount
        determined under clause (B) of this paragraph shall be based on 20% of
        the Consolidated Capital Expenditures permitted from the Closing Date
        through December 31, 2002 were annualized for all of Fiscal Year
        2002).

               (e)    Certain Calculations. With respect to any period during
which a Permitted Acquisition or an Asset Sale or other disposition of a
Health Care Facility has occurred (each, a "SUBJECT TRANSACTION"), for
purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
this Section 6.8 (but not for purposes of determining the Applicable Margin or
Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage), Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and the
components of Consolidated Fixed Charges shall be calculated with respect to
such period on a pro forma basis reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent (including pro forma adjustments arising out of events which are
directly attributable to a specific transaction, are factually supportable and
are expected to have a continuing impact, in each case determined on a basis
consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities
Act and as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, which would include cost
savings resulting from head count reduction, closure of facilities and similar
restructuring charges, which pro forma adjustments shall be certified by the
chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or treasurer of Company)
using the historical audited financial statements of any business so acquired
or to be acquired or sold or to be sold and the consolidated financial
statements of Company and its Subsidiaries which shall be reformulated as if
such Subject Transaction, and any Indebtedness incurred or repaid in
connection therewith, had been consummated or incurred or repaid at the
beginning of such period (and assuming that such Indebtedness bears interest
during any portion of the applicable measurement period prior to the relevant
acquisition at the weighted average of the interest rates applicable to
outstanding Loans incurred during such period).

business, property or fixed assets of, or stock or other evidence of
beneficial ownership of, any Person or any division or line of business or
other business unit of any Person, except:

                      (a)    any Guarantor Subsidiary and with the approval of
the Agents, any other Subsidiary of Company may be merged with or into Company
or any Guarantor, or be liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or all or any part
of its business, property or assets may be conveyed, sold, leased, transferred
or otherwise disposed of, in one transaction or a series of transactions, to
Company or any Guarantor; provided, in the case of such a merger, Company or
such Guarantor, as applicable shall be the continuing or surviving Person;

                      (b)    sales or other dispositions of (i) assets that do
not constitute Asset Sales and (ii) assets listed on Schedule 6.9;

                      (c)    Asset Sales, the proceeds of which (valued at the
principal amount thereof in the case of non-Cash proceeds consisting of notes
or other debt Securities and valued at fair market value in the case of other
non-Cash proceeds) (i) are less than $2,500,000 with respect to any single
Asset Sale or series of related Asset Sales and (ii) when aggregated with the
proceeds of all other Asset Sales made within the same Fiscal Year, are less
than $5,000,000; provided (1) the consideration received for such assets shall
be in an amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof (determined in
good faith by the board of directors of Company (or similar governing body)),
(2) no less than 75% thereof shall be paid in Cash, and (3) the Net Asset Sale
Proceeds thereof shall be applied as required by Section 2.14(a);

                      (e)    Permitted Acquisitions, the consideration
(including without limitation all Indebtedness assumed in connection with such
acquisition) for which constitutes (i) less than $10,000,000 in the aggregate
in any Fiscal Year, and (ii) less than $50,000,000 in the aggregate from the
Closing Date to the date of determination; provided that in no event shall any
Investment in any business or line of business deemed "reasonably related" to
the Closing Date business or lines of business of Company pursuant to clause
(vi) of the definition of Permitted Acquisitions (as opposed to any business
or line of business actually engaged in by the Credit Parties on the Closing
Date) exceed $2,500,000 during the term of this Agreement;

substantially concurrent exchange for other assets to be used in the business
(such newly acquired asset or assets a "Swapped Asset"); provided, however,
that (i) the aggregate LTM EBITDA for all Swapped Assets (determined for each
Swapped Asset as of the time of exchange thereof) during the term of this
Agreement shall not exceed $15,000,000; (ii) after giving effect to the asset
swap on a pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; (iii) LTM EBITDA for the Swapped Asset or aggregate LTM EBITDA for
a related series of Swapped Assets shall be at least 90% of LTM EBITDA for the
asset or related series of assets exchanged therefor; (iv) all aspects of the
asset swap (including, without limitation, the calculation of LTM EBITDA in
connection therewith) shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
the Joint Lead Arrangers in their sole discretion; (v) prior to consummating
any such asset swap, Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent a
certificate signed by the chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or
treasurer of Company demonstrating to the reasonable satisfaction of
Administrative Agent that, on a pro forma basis, Company would be in
compliance with each of the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.8, and
certifying that no Default or Event of Default exists immediately prior to and
immediately after giving effect to such asset swap; and (vi) prior to
consummating any such asset swap, Company shall have provided evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent demonstrating satisfaction of
the requirements of the Rollover Note Indenture or the Refinancing Note
Indenture (as the case may be) relating to such asset swap;

                      (g)    Investments made in accordance with Section 6.7;
and

                      (h)    cancellation, termination or surrender by any
Credit Party of any lease other than a Material Lease.

               6.10   DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARY INTERESTS. Except for any sale of
all of its interests in the Capital Stock of any of the Subsidiaries in
compliance with the provisions of Section 6.9, no Credit Party shall, nor
shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) directly or indirectly sell,
assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Capital Stock of any of
the Guarantor Subsidiaries or any Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary,
except to qualify directors if required by applicable law; or (b) permit any
of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly to sell, assign, pledge or
otherwise encumber or dispose of any Capital Stock of any of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries or any Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary, except to another
Credit Party (subject to the restrictions on such disposition otherwise
imposed hereunder), or to qualify directors if required by applicable law.

               6.11   SALES AND LEASE-BACKS. No Credit Party shall, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, become liable as
lessee or as a guarantor or other surety with respect to any lease of any
property (whether real, personal or mixed), whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, which such Credit Party (a) has sold or transferred or is to sell or
to transfer to any other Person (other than Company or any of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries), or (b) intends to use for substantially the same purpose as any
other property which has been or is to be sold or transferred by such Credit
Party to



                                    S-129
<PAGE>

any Person (other than Company or any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries) in
connection with such lease.

               6.12   TRANSACTIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND AFFILIATES. No Credit
Party shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, enter into or permit to exist any transaction (including the
purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any
service) with any holder of 15% or more of any class of Capital Stock of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with any Affiliate of Company or of any
such holder, on terms that are less favorable to Company or that Subsidiary,
as the case may be, than those that might be obtained at the time from a
Person who is not such a holder or Affiliate; provided, the foregoing
restriction shall not apply to (a) any transaction between Company and any
Guarantor; (b) reasonable and customary fees paid to members of the board of
directors (or similar governing body) of Company and its Subsidiaries; (c)
compensation arrangements for officers and other employees of Company and its
Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business; and (d)

                      (a)    From and after the Closing Date, no Credit Party
shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any business
other than (i) the businesses engaged in by any Credit Party on the Closing
Date and similar or related businesses and (ii) such other lines of business
as may be expressly permitted hereunder or otherwise consented to by Requisite
Lenders.

                      (b)    (i) Each Credit Party shall ensure that (1) from
and after the Closing Date, each of its Subsidiaries which is an Approved
Captive Insurance Subsidiary is a wholly owned Subsidiary of a Guarantor
Subsidiary, which Guarantor Subsidiary shall not engage in any business
activities or own any assets or properties other than the Capital Stock of
such Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary and otherwise as incident to its
existence as a holding company; and (2) from and after the Closing Date, each
of its Subsidiaries which is an Approved Captive Insurance Subsidiary shall
not engage in any business other than (or have any Contractual Obligation or
own any assets or properties (excluding Cash and Cash Equivalents) other than)
in connection with insurance fronting arrangements entered into with
financially sound and reputable insurers for the sole purpose of the Credit
Parties satisfying the requirements of Section 5.5 hereof; (ii) no Approved
Captive Insurance Subsidiary or its direct parent, shall directly or
indirectly, create, incur, assume or guaranty, or otherwise become or remain
directly or indirectly liable with respect to any Indebtedness (other than the
Obligations and the Rollover Notes); and (iii) no Approved Captive Insurance
Subsidiary or its direct parent, shall have any employees, material
Contractual Obligations, Investments, accounts, liabilities, claims or assets
other then incidental to the business of such entities as described in (i)
above.

               6.14   AMENDMENTS OR WAIVERS OF CERTAIN RELATED AGREEMENTS. No
Credit Party shall nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree to
any material amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification to, or
waiver of, any of its



                                    S-130
<PAGE>


material rights, interests or obligations under any Related Agreement after
the Closing Date without in each case obtaining the prior written consent of
Requisite Lenders (or in the case of any Related Agreement relating to a
Mortgage Loan, by Administrative Agent and Syndication Agent) to such
amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification or waiver. Without
limitation to the generality of the foregoing, no Credit Party shall, nor
shall it permit any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries to, so amend or change the
terms of any Related Agreement, or make any payment consistent with any such
amendment thereof or change thereto without the aforesaid consent of the
Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent and Syndication Agent (as
applicable), if the effect of such amendment or change is to increase the
interest rate under such Related Agreement, change any dates upon which
payments of principal or interest are due thereon, make stricter any event of
default (or amend, modify or supplement the definition thereof) or condition
to an event of default with respect thereto, change the redemption, prepayment
or defeasance provisions thereof, change the subordination provisions of any
such Related Agreement (or of any guaranty in respect thereof), or if the
effect of such amendment or change, together with all other amendments or
changes made, is to increase materially the obligations of the obligor
thereunder or to confer any additional rights on the holders of such
Indebtedness under such Related Agreement (or a trustee or other
representative on their behalf) which would be adverse to any Credit Party or
Lenders.

               6.15   JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS. The Company shall not,
nor shall it permit any other Credit Party to enter into or be party to any
Joint Venture (including, without limitation, by way of selling the Capital
Stock of a Subsidiary), other than with the PHCMI Debtors, unless (a) any
interest received by a Credit Party in such Joint Venture is pledged to the
Joint Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) pursuant
hereto and (b) permitted by Sections 6.7(g) or (i).

               6.16   FISCAL YEAR.  No Credit Party shall, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to change its Fiscal Year-end from December 31.

               6.17   HEALTH CARE PERMITS AND APPROVALS. No Credit Party shall
(i) fail to maintain in effect all Health Care Permits and Reimbursement
Approvals necessary to the operation of its business, or (ii) shall engage in
any activity that (a) constitutes or, with the giving of notice, the passage
of time, or both, would result in a material violation of, any Health Care
Permit necessary for the lawful conduct of its business or operations or (b)
constitutes or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would
result in the loss by any Health Care Facility owned, leased, managed or
operated by the Company or any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries of the right to
participate in, and receive payment under, the appropriate Medicare, Medicaid
and related reimbursement programs, and any similar state or local
government-sponsored program, to the extent that such Credit Party has decided
to participate in any such program, and to receive reimbursement from private
and commercial payers and health maintenance organizations to the extent
applicable thereto, in each case under (i) and (ii), except where the loss of
such Health Care Permit or rights to participate in or receive payments under

Effect.

               6.18   CHANGES TO CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY AGREEMENTS. No

SECTION 7.     GUARANTY

               7.1    GUARANTY OF THE OBLIGATIONS. Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.2, Guarantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guaranty to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of
the Beneficiaries the due and punctual payment in full of all Obligations when
the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment,
declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would
become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of
the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a)) (collectively, the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS").

               7.2    CONTRIBUTION BY GUARANTORS. All Guarantors desire to
allocate among themselves (collectively, the "CONTRIBUTING GUARANTORS"), in a
fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty.
Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a
Guarantor (a "FUNDING GUARANTOR") under this Guaranty that exceeds its Fair
Share as of such date, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a
contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors in the amount of
such other Contributing Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall as of such date, with
the result that all such contributions will cause each Contributing
Guarantor's Aggregate Payments to equal its Fair Share as of such date. "FAIR
SHARE" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of
determination, an amount equal to (a) the ratio of (i) the Fair Share
Contribution Amount with respect to such Contributing Guarantor to (ii) the
aggregate of the Fair Share Contribution Amounts with respect to all
Contributing Guarantors multiplied by (b) the aggregate amount paid or
distributed on or before such date by all Funding Guarantors under this
Guaranty in respect of the obligations Guaranteed. "FAIR SHARE SHORTFALL"
means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of
determination, the excess, if any, of the Fair Share of such Contributing
Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of such Contributing Guarantor. "FAIR
SHARE CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as
of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations
of such Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty that would not render its
obligations hereunder or thereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code
or any comparable applicable provisions of state law; provided, solely for
purposes of calculating the "FAIR SHARE CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT" with respect to
any Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this Section 7.2, any assets or
liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor arising by virtue of any rights to
subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification or any rights to or obligations
of contribution hereunder shall not be considered as assets or liabilities of
such Contributing Guarantor. "AGGREGATE PAYMENTS" means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (1)
the





                                    S-132
<PAGE>



aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or before such date
by such Contributing Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty (including, without
limitation, in respect of this Section 7.2), minus (2) the aggregate amount of
all payments received on or before such date by such Contributing Guarantor
from the other Contributing Guarantors as contributions under this Section
7.2. The amounts payable as contributions hereunder shall be determined as of
the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the
applicable Funding Guarantor. The allocation among Contributing Guarantors of
their obligations as set forth in this Section 7.2 shall not be construed in
any way to limit the liability of any Contributing Guarantor hereunder. Each
Guarantor is a third party beneficiary to the contribution agreement set forth
in this Section 7.2.

               7.3    PAYMENT BY GUARANTORS. Subject to Section 7.2,
Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree, in furtherance of the foregoing
and not in limitation of any other right which any Beneficiary may have at law
or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of
Company to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall
become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but
for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a)), Guarantors will upon demand pay, or cause to
be paid, in Cash, to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of
Beneficiaries, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of
all Guaranteed Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest
on such Guaranteed Obligations (including interest which, but for Company's
becoming the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued
on such Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against
Company for such interest in the related bankruptcy case) and all other
Guaranteed Obligations then owed to Beneficiaries as aforesaid.

               7.4    LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor agrees
that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes
a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than payment in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and
without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:

                      (a)    this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due
and not of collectibility.  This Guaranty is a primary obligation of each
Guarantor and not merely a contract of surety;

                      (b)    Administrative Agent may enforce this Guaranty
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default notwithstanding the existence of
any dispute between Company and any Beneficiary with respect to the existence
of such Event of Default;

                      (c)    the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are
independent of the obligations of Company and the obligations of any other
guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the obligations of Company, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such
Guarantor whether or not any action






                                    S-133
<PAGE>


is brought against Company or any of such other guarantors and whether or not
Company is joined in any such action or actions;

                      (d)    payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not
all, of the Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or
abridge any Guarantor's liability for any portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations which has not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought
to enforce any Guarantor's covenant to pay a portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from
its covenant to pay the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the
subject of such suit, and such judgment shall not, except to the extent
satisfied by such Guarantor, limit, affect, modify or abridge any other
Guarantor's liability hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations;

                      (e)    any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems
appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or
enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment,
discharge or termination of any Guarantor's liability hereunder, from time to
time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or
otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or
refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the
Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate
the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request
and accept other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold
security for the payment hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release,
surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter,
subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment
of the Guaranteed Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person (including any other
Guarantor) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce and apply
any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary
in respect hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations and direct the order or manner
of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such Beneficiary
may have against any such security, in each case as such Beneficiary in its
discretion may determine consistent herewith or the applicable Hedge Agreement
and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such
security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not
every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such
action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against Company or any
security for the Guaranteed Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights
available to it under the Credit Documents or the Hedge Agreements; and

                      (f)    this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantors
hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason
(other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the
occurrence of any of the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have
had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert
or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay


                                    S-134
<PAGE>


or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the
exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy
(whether arising under the Credit Documents or the Hedge Agreements, at law,
in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any
agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or
security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any rescission,
waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of
the terms or provisions (including provisions relating to events of default)
hereof, any of the other Credit Documents, any of the Hedge Agreements or any
agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or
security for the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether or not in
accordance with the terms hereof or such Credit Document, such Hedge Agreement
or any agreement relating to such other guaranty or security; (iii) the
Guaranteed Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto, at any time being
found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the
application of payments received from any source (other than payments received
pursuant to the other Credit Documents or any of the Hedge Agreements or from
the proceeds of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, except to the
extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the
Guaranteed Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the
Guaranteed Obligations, even though any Beneficiary might have elected to
apply such payment to any part or all of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any
Beneficiary's consent to the change, reorganization or termination of the
corporate structure or existence of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to
any corresponding restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any
failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any
collateral which secures any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any
defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which Company may allege or assert against
any Beneficiary in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including failure of
consideration, breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of
limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other act or
thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might
in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.

               7.5    WAIVERS BY GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor hereby waives, for
the benefit of Beneficiaries: (a) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a
condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against
Company, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from Company, any such other guarantor or any other Person, (iii) proceed
against or have resort to any balance of any Deposit Account or credit on the
books of any Beneficiary in favor of Company or any other Person, or (iv)
pursue any other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever; (b) any
defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any
disability or other defense of Company or any other Guarantor including any
defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the
unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of Company or
any other Guarantor from any cause other than payment in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law
which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in
amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (d)
any defense based upon





                                    S-135
<PAGE>

any Beneficiary's errors or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed
Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any
principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be
in conflict with the terms hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of such
Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of
limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement
hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv)
promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Beneficiary protect,
secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property
subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including
acceptance hereof, notices of default hereunder, the Hedge Agreements or any
agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or
modification of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement related thereto,
notices of any extension of credit to Company and notices of any of the
matters referred to in Section 7.4 and any right to consent to any thereof;
and (g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law
which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may
conflict with the terms hereof.

               7.6    GUARANTORS' RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC.
Until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and
the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit
shall have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor hereby waives any claim,
right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may
hereafter have against Company or any other Guarantor or any of its assets in
connection with this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its
obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises
in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and
including without limitation (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against
Company with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce,
or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Beneficiary now has
or may hereafter have against Company, and (c) any benefit of, and any right
to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any
Beneficiary. In addition, until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
indefeasibly paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated
and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor
shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution such Guarantor may have
against any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed
Obligations, including, without limitation, any such right of contribution as
contemplated by Section 7.2. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent
the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation,
reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason,
any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may
have against Company or against any collateral or security, and any rights of
contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall
be junior and subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary may have against
Company, to all right, title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such
collateral or security, and to any right any Beneficiary may have against such
other guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of
any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at
any time when all Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been



                                    S-136
<PAGE>


finally and indefeasibly paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for
Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid
over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited
and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured,
in accordance with the terms hereof.

               7.7    SUBORDINATION OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS. Any Indebtedness of
Company or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (the "OBLIGEE
GUARANTOR") is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any such indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee
Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be
held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall
forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of
Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations
but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of
the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision hereof.

               7.8    CONTINUING GUARANTY. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall have been paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have
terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled.
Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as
to future transactions giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.

               7.9    AUTHORITY OF GUARANTORS OR COMPANY. It is not necessary
for any Beneficiary to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Guarantor or
Company or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act
on behalf of any of them.

                7.10  FINANCIAL CONDITION OF COMPANY. Any Credit Extension may
be made to Company or continued from time to time, and any Hedge Agreements may
be entered into from time to time, in each case without notice to or
authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition
of Company at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such
Hedge Agreement is entered into, as the case may be. No Beneficiary shall have
any obligation to disclose or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment, or any
Guarantor's assessment, of the financial condition of Company. Each Guarantor
has adequate means to obtain information from Company on a continuing basis
concerning the financial condition of Company and its ability to perform its
obligations under the Credit Documents and the Hedge Agreements, and each
Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the
financial condition of Company and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and
relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter,
fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of Company now
known or hereafter known by any Beneficiary.


               7.11   BANKRUPTCY, ETC.

                      (a)    So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain
outstanding, no Guarantor shall, without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of Requisite Lenders,
commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy,
reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding



                                    S-137

<PAGE>


of or against Company or any other Guarantor. The obligations of Guarantors
hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred,
suspended or terminated by any case or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary,
involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization,
liquidation or arrangement of Company or any other Guarantor or by any defense
which Company or any other Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree
or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such
proceeding.

                      (b)    Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any
interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the
commencement of any case or proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if
interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by
operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case or proceeding,
such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations if such case or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be
included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of
Guarantors and Beneficiaries that the Guaranteed Obligations which are
guaranteed by Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without regard
to any rule of law or order which may relieve Company of any portion of such
Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy,
receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or
similar person to pay Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of
Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date
on which such case or proceeding is commenced.

                      (c)    In the event that all or any portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations are paid by Company, the obligations of Guarantors
hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated,
as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are
rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a
preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are
so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all
purposes hereunder.

               7.12   DISCHARGE OF GUARANTY UPON SALE OF GUARANTOR. If all of
the Capital Stock of any Guarantor or any of its successors in interest
hereunder shall be sold or otherwise disposed of (including by merger or
consolidation) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the
Guaranty of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the case may be,
hereunder shall automatically be discharged and released without any further
action by any Beneficiary or any other Person effective as of the time of such
Asset Sale.

SECTION 8.     EVENTS OF DEFAULT

               8.1    EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  If any one or more of the following
conditions or events shall occur:

                      (a)    Failure to Make Payments When Due. Failure by
Company to pay (i) when due any installment of principal of any Loan, whether
at stated



                                    S-138
<PAGE>


maturity, by acceleration, by notice of voluntary prepayment, by mandatory
prepayment or otherwise; (ii) when due any amount payable to Issuing Bank in
reimbursement of any drawing under a Letter of Credit; or (iii) any interest
on any Loan or any fee or any other amount due hereunder within two (2)
Business Days after the date due; or

                      (b)    Default in Other Agreements. (i) Failure of any
Credit Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries to pay when due any
principal of or interest on or any other amount payable in respect of one or
more items of Indebtedness (other than (1) Indebtedness referred to in Section
8.1(a) and (2) Indebtedness of the PHCMI Debtors to Omega, so long as such
Indebtedness constitutes Designated Non-Recourse Debt) in an individual or
aggregate principal amount of $2,500,000 or more, in each case beyond the
grace period, if any, provided therefor; or (ii) breach or default by any
Credit Party with respect to any other material term of (1) one or more items
of Indebtedness in the individual or aggregate principal amounts referred to
in clause (i) above or (2) any loan agreement, mortgage, indenture or other
agreement relating to such item(s) of Indebtedness, in each case beyond the
grace period, if any, provided therefor, if the effect of such breach or
default is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of that Indebtedness
(or a trustee on behalf of such holder or holders), to cause, that
Indebtedness to become or be declared due and payable (or redeemable) prior to

                      (b)    Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent nor any of its
officers, partners, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders
for any action taken or omitted by any Agent under or in connection with any

negligence or willful misconduct. Each Agent shall be entitled to refrain from
any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action)
in connection herewith or any of the other Credit Documents or from the
exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or
thereunder unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in
respect thereof from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be
required to give such instructions under Section 10.5) and, upon receipt of
such instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case

with such instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing,

impose any duties or obligations upon, any Agent in its individual capacity as
a Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the
Letters of Credit, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as if it were not performing the
duties and functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" shall,
unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include each Agent in its
individual capacity. Any Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial
advisory or other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if it were
not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from Company for services in connection herewith and otherwise
without having to account for the same to Lenders.

or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such
investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether
coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time


                                    S-144

liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Agent in exercising its powers, rights
and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the other Credit

arising out hereof or the other Credit Documents; provided, no Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any
indemnity furnished to any Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such
Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for additional
indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until
such additional indemnity is furnished; provided, in no event shall this
sentence require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability,
obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or
disbursement in excess of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof; and provided
further, this sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify
any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action,
judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement described in the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence.

                      (b)    Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share,

proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to indemnify the Joint
Collateral Agent, to the extent that the Joint Collateral Agent shall not have
been reimbursed by any Credit Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after
demand (or incurrence if the Joint Collateral Agent is stayed from making any
demand), for and against any and all liabilities to any depositary bank in
respect of reimbursement or payment obligations or indemnity obligations under
any control agreement entered into by the Joint Collateral Agent on the
Closing Date or otherwise at the direction of the Administrative Agent, if and
to the extent that at the time that the Joint Collateral Agent is obligated to
reimburse, pay or indemnify a depositary bank, the Joint Collateral Agent is
prohibited by operation of law or otherwise from discharging such
reimbursement, payment or indemnity obligations from the proceeds of
Collateral held by it or the same are inadequate.

               9.9    CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS.

                      (a)    Within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, the Company shall establish with the Administrative Agent (i) an account
(the "Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account") in the name of the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Beneficiaries), into which the
Company may from time to time deposit Dollars pursuant to, and in accordance
with Section 2.15(v) hereof and (ii) an account (the "Borrowing Base
Deficiency Cash Collateral Account" and together with the Breakage Cost Cash
Collateral Account, the "Cash Collateral Accounts") in the name of the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Beneficiaries), into which the
Company may from time to time deposit Dollars pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 2.15(vi). Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section
9.9, the Cash Collateral Accounts shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Administrative Agent and shall be subject to a control agreement
entered into between the Company and the Administrative Agent.

                      (b)    The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and
directed to invest and reinvest the funds from time to time deposited into the
Cash Collateral Accounts, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, on the instructions of the Company (provided, that any such
instructions given verbally shall be confirmed promptly in writing) or, if the
Company shall fail to give such



                                    S-148
<PAGE>

instructions upon delivery of any such funds, in the sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent; provided, that in no event may the Company give
instructions to the Administrative Agent to, or may the Administrative Agent
in its discretion, invest or reinvest funds in either of the Cash Collateral
Accounts in other than Cash Equivalents and nor may funds in either of the
Cash Collateral Accounts be co-mingled.

                      (c)    Any net income or gain on the investment of funds
from time to time held in either of the Cash Collateral Accounts, shall be
promptly reinvested by the Administrative Agent as a part of the relevant Cash
Collateral Account; and any net loss on any such investment shall be charged
against the relevant Cash Collateral Account.

                      (d)    None of the Agents, the Issuing Bank, any of the
Lenders nor any other Secured Party shall be a trustee for any of the Credit
Parties, or shall have any obligations or responsibilities, or shall be liable
for anything done or not done, in connection with either of the Cash
Collateral Accounts, except as expressly provided herein and except that the
Administrative Agent shall have the obligations of a secured party under the
UCC. None of the Agents, the Issuing Bank, any of the Lenders nor any other
Secured Party shall have any obligation or responsibility or shall be liable
in any way for any investment decision made in accordance with this Section
9.9 or for any decrease in the value of the investments held in either of the
Cash Collateral Accounts.

                      (e)    Grant of Security Interest. For value received
and to induce the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit and the Lenders to
enter into this Agreement and to make loans to the Company and to acquire
participations in Letters of Credit from time to time as provided for in this
Agreement, as security for the payment of all of the Obligations, each of the
Credit Parties hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of
the Beneficiaries) and grants to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of
the Beneficiaries), a first priority Lien upon all of such Credit Party's
rights in and to the Cash Collateral Accounts, all cash, documents,
instruments and securities from time to time held therein, and all rights
pertaining to investments of funds in the Cash Collateral Accounts and all
products and proceeds of any of the foregoing. All Cash, documents,
instruments and securities from time to time on deposit in the Cash Collateral
Account, and all rights pertaining to investments of funds in the Cash
Collateral Account shall immediately and without any need for any further
action on the part of any of the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent or
any Beneficiaries, become subject to the Lien set forth in this Section, be
deemed Collateral for all purposes hereof and be subject to the provisions of
this Credit Agreement.

                      (f)    Remedies. At any time during the continuation of
an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may sell any documents,
instruments and securities held in the Cash Collateral Accounts and may
immediately apply the proceeds thereof and any other cash held in the Cash
Collateral Accounts in accordance with Section 9.10.

               9.10   APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. All proceeds received by the
Administrative Agent in respect of any sale, any collection from, or other
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral by the Joint Collateral
Agent (or in the case of the




                                    S-149
<PAGE>


Cash Collateral Accounts, the Administrative Agent itself) shall be applied in
full or in part by the Administrative Agent against, the Obligations in the
following order of priority: first, to the payment of all costs and expenses
of such sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable
compensation to the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and all
other expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which the
Administrative Agent is entitled to indemnification hereunder (in its capacity
as the Administrative Agent and not as a Lender) and all advances made by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the applicable Credit Party,
and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy
hereunder or under any Collateral Document, all in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof; second, to the extent of any excess, to the payment of all
other Obligations for the ratable benefit of the Beneficiaries; and third, to
the extent of any excess such proceeds, to the payment to or upon the order of
such Credit Parties or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

               10.3   INDEMNITY.

                      (a)    In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant
to Section 10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, each Credit Party agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees'
selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless, the Joint Collateral
Agent, each Agent and Lender and the officers, partners, directors, trustees,
employees, agents and Affiliates of each Agent and each Lender (each, an
"INDEMNITEE"), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided,
no Credit Party shall have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with
respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified
Liabilities arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that
Indemnitee. To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and
hold harmless set forth in this Section 10.3 may be unenforceable in whole or
in part because they are violative of any law or public policy, the applicable
Credit Party shall contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay
and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, no Credit Party shall assert, and each hereby
waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any
Credit Document or any agreement or instrument or transaction contemplated
hereby.

                      (b)    To the extent permitted by applicable law,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall assert, and
hereby waives, any claim against any Lender or any of their Affiliates,
directors, employees, attorneys or agents, on any theory of liability, for
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort
or duty imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in
connection with, arising out of, as a result of, or in any way related to,
this Agreement or any Credit Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof or any act or omission or
event occurring in connection therewith, and Company hereby waives, releases
and agrees not to sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not
accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

                      (c)    The indemnification provisions set forth in this
Section 10.3 shall supersede any indemnification obligations of Company and
the Guarantor Subsidiaries contained in any loan commitment or other agreement
executed and delivered by Company prior to the Closing Date with respect to
the financing contemplated by this Agreement, except as it relates to any
claim, action, loss, liability, cost or expense incurred by the Agents or any
Lender in connection with or otherwise arising from acts, omissions or events
occurring prior to the Closing Date.

               10.4   SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights,
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default each
Lender is hereby authorized by each Credit Party at any time or from time to
time, subject to the consent of Administrative Agent (such consents not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), without prior notice to any Credit Party or
to any other Person (other than Administrative Agent), any such notice being
hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and
all deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by
certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust
accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party to such Lender
hereunder, the Letter of Credit and participations therein and under the other
Credit Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising
out of or connected hereto, the Letters of Credit and participations therein
or with any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not (a) such
Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) the principal of or the
interest on the Loans or any amounts in respect of the Letters of Credit or
any other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to
Section 2 and although such obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may
be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender so exercising its right of set off
provided herein shall promptly thereafter give written notice to Company of
such action and the amount of the set-off.

        Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant hereto may be

        SHARE" on substantially the same basis as the Term Loan Commitments,
        the Term Loan, the Revolving Commitments and the Revolving Loans are
        included on the Closing Date;

                             (ix)   release all or substantially all of the

        Lender over the amount thereof then in effect without the consent of
        such Lender; provided, no amendment, modification or waiver of any

                             (ii)   increase the Revolving Commitment or the
        Term Loan Commitment over the amount thereof then in effect (A)
        without the consent of the Supermajority Lenders, if immediately prior
        to and after giving effect to such increase, the Total Debt Leverage
        Ratio is no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 and the Senior Debt Leverage
        Ratio is no greater than 2.50 to 1.00 and (B) without the consent of
        each Lender, if immediately prior to and after giving effect to such

        LENDERS" without the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of each Class;
        provided, with the consent of the Requisite Lenders, additional
        extensions of credit pursuant hereto may be included in the
        determination of such "REQUISITE CLASS LENDERS" on substantially the
        same basis as the Term Loan Commitments, the Term Loan, the Revolving
        Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Closing Date;

                             (v)    alter the required application of any
        repayments or prepayments as between Classes pursuant to Section 2.15
        without the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of each Class which is
        being allocated a lesser repayment or prepayment as a result thereof;
        provided, Requisite Lenders may waive, in whole or in part, any
        prepayment so long as the application, as between Classes, of any
        portion of such prepayment which is still required to be made is not
        altered;

                             (vi)   amend, modify, terminate or waive any

        is to be acceptable to or approved by the Agents or any specifically
        identified Agent, without the consent of the Agents or the Agents so
        identified (as the case may be), and in any such event it shall not be
        necessary to obtain the consent of any other Lender to such waiver;





                                    S-154
<PAGE>



                             (viii) amend, modify, terminate or waive any
        provision of Section 9 as the same applies to any Agent, or any other

        any Agent, in each case without the consent of such Agent; or

                             (ix)   amend, modify, terminate or waive the

Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of
such Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or
demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any
amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance
with this Section 10.5 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time
outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by a Credit Party, on such
Credit Party.

               10.6   SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS.

                      (a)    Generally. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of
Lenders. No Credit Party's rights or obligations hereunder nor any interest
therein may be assigned or delegated by any Credit Party without the prior
written consent of all Lenders. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the
extent expressly contemplated hereby, Affiliates of each of the Agents and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

                      (b)    Register. Company, Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as
the holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments and Loans listed
therein for all purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such
Commitment or Loan shall be effective, in each case, unless and until an
Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall have
been delivered to and accepted by Administrative Agent and recorded in the
Register as provided in Section 10.6(e). Prior to such recordation, all
amounts owed with respect to the applicable Commitment or Loan shall be owed
to the Lender listed in the Register as the owner thereof, and any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or





                                    S-155
<PAGE>

consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding
Commitments or Loans.

                      (c)    Right to Assign. Each Lender shall have the right
at any time to sell, assign or transfer all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment or Loans owing to it or other Obligation (provided,
however, that each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and not varying,
percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of any Loan and
any related Commitments; provided, further, for the avoidance of doubt, that
nothing herein shall require a Lender to make pro rata assignments of both its
Revolving Commitments and Term Loan Commitment which shall remain at all times
independently assignable):

                             (i)    to any Person meeting the criteria of
        clause (i) of the definition of the term of "Eligible Assignee" upon
        the giving of notice to Company and Administrative Agent; and

                             (ii)   to any Person meeting the criteria of
        clause (ii) of the definition of the term of "Eligible Assignee" and,
        in the case of assignments of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments
        to any such Person (except in the case of assignments made by or to
        GSCP), consented to by each of Company (except during the existence of
        an Event of Default) and Administrative Agent (each such consent not
        to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, further each such
        assignment pursuant to this Section 10.6(c)(ii) --------  -------
        shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than (A) $1,000,000 (or
        such lesser amount as may be agreed to by Company and Administrative
        Agent or as shall constitute the aggregate amount of the Revolving
        Commitments and Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender) with respect
        to the assignment of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans and
        (B) $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by Company
        and Administrative Agent or as shall constitute the aggregate amount
        of the Term Loan) with respect to the assignment of the Term Loan.

                      (d)    Mechanics. The assigning Lender and the assignee
thereof shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment
Agreement, together with (i) a processing and recordation fee of $500 in the
case of assignments pursuant to Section 10.6(c)(i) or made by or to GSCP, and
$2,000 in the case of all other assignments (except that only one fee shall be
payable in the case of contemporaneous assignments to Related Funds), and (ii)
such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to United
States federal income tax withholding matters as the assignee under such
Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 2.20(c).

                      (e)    Notice of Assignment. Upon its receipt of a duly
executed and completed Assignment Agreement, together with the processing and
recordation fee referred to in Section 10.6(d) (and any forms, certificates or
other evidence required by this Agreement in connection therewith),
Administrative Agent shall record the



                                    S-156
<PAGE>


information contained in such Assignment Agreement in the Register, shall give
prompt notice thereof to Company and shall maintain a copy of such Assignment
Agreement.

                      (f)    Representations and Warranties of Assignee. Each
Lender, upon execution and delivery hereof or upon executing and delivering an
Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, represents and warrants as of the
Closing Date or as of the applicable Effective Date (as defined in the
applicable Assignment Agreement) that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it
has experience and expertise in the making of or investing in commitments or
loans such as the applicable Commitments or Loans, as the case may be; and
(iii) it will make or invest in, as the case may be, its Commitments or Loans
for its own account in the ordinary course of its business and without a view
to distribution of such Commitments or Loans within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being
understood that, subject to the provisions of this Section 10.6, the
disposition of such Commitments or Loans or any interests therein shall at all
times remain within its exclusive control).

                      (g)    Effect of Assignment. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 10.6, as of the "Effective Date" specified in the
applicable Assignment Agreement: (i) the assignee thereunder shall have the
rights and obligations of a "Lender" hereunder to the extent such rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
Agreement and shall thereafter be a party hereto and a "Lender" for all
purposes hereof; (ii) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned thereby pursuant to
such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which
survive the termination hereof under Section 10.8) and be released from its
obligations hereunder (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering
all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
hereunder, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided, anything
contained in any of the Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, (y)
Issuing Bank shall continue to have all rights and obligations thereof with
respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such
Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder and
(z) such assigning Lender shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of all
indemnities hereunder as specified herein with respect to matters arising out
of the prior involvement of such assigning Lender as a Lender hereunder);
(iii) the Commitments shall be modified to reflect the Commitment of such
assignee and any Revolving Commitment of such assigning Lender, if any; and
(iv) if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any Note hereunder,
the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as
promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Notes to
Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon Company shall issue and
deliver new Notes, if so requested by the assignee and/or assigning Lender, to
such assignee and/or to such assigning Lender, with appropriate insertions, to
reflect the new Revolving Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of the assignee
and/or the assigning Lender.

                      (h)    Participations. Each Lender shall have the right
at any time to sell one or more participations to any Person (other than
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates (other than an
Affiliate which is also a Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender) in all or any
part of its Commitments, Loans or in any other



                                    S-157
<PAGE>

Obligation. The holder of any such participation, other than an Affiliate of
the Lender granting such participation, shall not be entitled to require such
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except with respect to any
amendment, modification or waiver that would (i) extend the final scheduled
maturity of any Loan, Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit
is not extended beyond the Revolving Commitment Termination Date) in which
such participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of
payment of interest or fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of
applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the
principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the participant's
participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that
a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the
Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation,
and that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the
consent of any participant if the participant's participation is not increased
as a result thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit
Party of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral under the Collateral
Documents (except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) supporting
the Loans hereunder in which such participant is participating. The Company
agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.18(c), 2.19 and 2.20 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section;
provided, (i) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made
with the Company's prior written consent and (ii) a participant that would be
a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.20 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such
participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to
comply with Section 2.20 as though it were a Lender. To the extent permitted
by law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section
10.4 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.

                      (i)    Certain Other Assignments. In addition to any
other assignment permitted pursuant to this Section 10.6, (i) any Lender may
assign and/or pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations
owed by or to such Lender, and its Notes, if any, to secure obligations of
such Lender including, without limitation, any Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such Federal
Reserve Bank; provided, no Lender, as between Company and such Lender, shall
be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such
assignment and pledge, and provided further, in no event shall the applicable
Federal Reserve Bank or trustee be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled
to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

               10.7   INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would





                                    S-158
<PAGE>

otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or
condition exists.

               10.8   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.
All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the
execution and delivery hereof and the making of any Credit Extension.
Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by law to the contrary, the
agreements of each Credit Party set forth in Sections 2.18(c), 2.19, 2.20,
10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in Sections 2.17
and 9.6 shall survive the payment of the Loans, the cancellation or expiration
of the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
thereunder, and the termination hereof, though such survival shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining when the Agents are required to
release the Collateral in connection with the payment in full of the Loans and
the termination of the Revolving Commitment.

               10.9    NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on
the part of any Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall impair such
power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right or privilege. The rights, powers and remedies given to each
Agent and each Lender hereby are cumulative and shall be in addition to and
independent of all rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any
statute or rule of law or in any of the other Credit Documents or any of the
Hedge Agreements. Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such
right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it
preclude the further exercise of any such right, power or remedy.

               10.10  MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither any Agent nor
any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any
Credit Party or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations. To the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments
to Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to Administrative Agent, on behalf of
Lenders), or Administrative Agent or Lenders enforce any security interests or
exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or
required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable
cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies
therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or
setoff had not occurred.

               10.11  SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or obligation
hereunder or any Note shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such




                                    S-159
<PAGE>

provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

               10.12  OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS'
RIGHTS. The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall
be responsible for the obligations or Commitment of any other Lender
hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Credit Document, and no
action taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to
constitute Lenders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender
shall be a separate and independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights arising out hereof and it shall not be
necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

               10.13  HEADINGS. Section headings herein are included herein
for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part hereof for
any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

               10.14  APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

               10.15  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
BROUGHT AGAINST ANY CREDIT PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING HERETO OR ANY
OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT, OR ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE
OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF
NEW YORK. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH CREDIT PARTY, FOR
ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (a) ACCEPTS
GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH
COURTS; (b) WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (c) AGREES THAT
SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY
REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO THE APPLICABLE
CREDIT PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 10.1; (d)
AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (c) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER
PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THE APPLICABLE CREDIT PARTY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING
IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN
EVERY RESPECT; AND (e) AGREES AGENTS AND LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE
PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
ANY CREDIT PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

               10.16  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE LENDER/COMPANY RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED.
THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL
DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY
CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING
INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS
RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS
THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY
AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED
EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER
SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 10.16 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE
HEREUNDER. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A
WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

               10.17  CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender shall hold all non-public
information regarding Company, its Subsidiaries and their business identified
as such by Company and obtained by such Lender pursuant to the requirements
hereof in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling
confidential information of such nature, it being understood and agreed by
each Credit Party that, in any event, a Lender may make (i) disclosures of
such information to Affiliates of such Lender and to their agents and advisors
(and to other persons authorized by a Lender or Agent to organize, present or
disseminate such information in connection with disclosures otherwise made in
accordance with this Section 10.17), (ii) disclosures of such information
reasonably required by any bona fide or potential assignee, transferee or
participant in connection with the contemplated assignment, transfer or
participation by such Lender of any Loans or any participations therein or by
any direct or indirect contractual counterparties (or the professional
advisors thereto) in Hedge Agreements (provided, such counterparties and
advisors are advised of and agree to be bound by the provisions of this
Section 10.17), (iii) disclosure to any rating agency when required by





                                    S-161
<PAGE>

it, provided that, prior to any disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake
in writing to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information
relating to the Credit Parties received by it from any of the Agents or any
Lender, and (iv) disclosures required or requested by any governmental agency
or representative thereof or by the NAIC or pursuant to legal process;
provided, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order,
each Lender shall make reasonable efforts promptly to notify Company of any
request by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any
such request in connection with any examination of the financial condition or
other routine examination of such Lender by such governmental agency) for
disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such
information.

               10.18  USURY SAVINGS CLAUSE. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of
the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed
in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the
preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest
Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear
interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due
hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if
the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been
in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full
the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided
for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due
hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at
all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, Company shall
pay to Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the
amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid
if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and Company to conform strictly
to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for,
charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of
the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically
and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the
outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Company.

               10.19  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but
one and the same instrument.

               10.20  EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective
upon the execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and
receipt by Company and Administrative Agent of written or telephonic
notification of such execution and authorization of delivery thereof.

                               OPINIONS OF COUNSEL

           Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit D not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement to which this
Exhibit D is attached.

A.  GENERALLY.

           1. The Company and each other Credit Party is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization
as identified in Schedule 4.1 to the Credit Agreement, has all requisite power
and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Credit Documents to
which it is a party and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby, and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction
identified in Schedule 4.1 to the Credit Agreement. Schedule 4.1 correctly sets
forth the ownership interest of Company and each of its Subsidiaries in their
respective Subsidiaries.

           2. The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents
have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Credit
Party that is a party thereto. The execution, delivery and performance by Credit
Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and will not
violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or regulation
applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of the Organizational
Documents of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any order, judgment or
decree of any court or other agency of government binding on Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; except as otherwise set forth in the Acquisition Agreement,
conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than any Liens created under any of the Credit Documents in favor of
Joint Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders (the
"SECURED PARTIES")); or require any approval of stockholders or any approval or
consent of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or consents which will be obtained on or
before the Closing Date and disclosed in writing to Lenders, or as otherwise set
forth in the Acquisition Agreement.

           3. The execution, delivery and performance by Credit Parties of the
Credit Documents to which they are parties and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and will not require
any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to,
with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority or regulatory
body except as otherwise set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, and except for
filings and


                                  EXHIBIT D-1


<PAGE>


recordings with respect to the Collateral to be made, or otherwise delivered to
Collateral Monitoring Agent, as of the Closing Date.

           4. Each Credit Document has been duly executed and delivered by each
Credit Party that is a party thereto and is the legally valid and binding
obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party in
accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability.

           5. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
under any other federal or state statute or regulation which may limit its
ability to incur Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any portion
of the Obligations unenforceable.

           6. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. The pledge of
the Investment Property Collateral pursuant the Pledge and Security Agreement
does not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

           Opinions with respect to the Credit Documents may be subject to the
following qualifications:

                     (i) enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
           insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
           affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
           equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at
           law);

                     (ii) certain of the remedial provisions, including waivers,
           with respect to the exercise of remedies contained in the Credit
           Documents may be unenforceable in whole or in part, but the inclusion
           of such provisions does not affect the validity of any Credit
           Document, taken as a whole;

                     (iii) counsel may assume that each Credit Document
           constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party to
           such agreement (other than Company and each other Credit Party)
           enforceable against each such party (other than Company or any other
           Credit Party ) in accordance with its terms.
