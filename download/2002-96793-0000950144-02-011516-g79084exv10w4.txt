                  (a)      Advances. Provided the Available Loan Commitment is
sufficient to permit an Advance to be made under the terms of this Agreement
plus the Retainage to be withheld for such Advance as herein provided and
Borrowers have delivered to Bank an irrevocable written notice for Advance under
the Loan in the form of a Request for Advance from Loan, Bank shall make the
Advance to Borrowers after Bank has received a written report from USA
Inspection Services, LLC which establishes the Construction Costs for which the
Advance is to be made. In the event Bank needs additional information to
establish Available Loan Commitment sufficient to permit a requested Advance to
be made, such Advance will be made within a reasonable time after such Available
Loan Commitment is established and the referenced written report in respect of
such Advance from USA Inspection Services, LLC has been received by Bank. The

reasonable efforts to disburse each Advance hereunder within a reasonable period
of time after Borrowers request such Advance.

Bank shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, disburse the amount in immediately available funds by crediting the
amount made available to the operating account in Bank established by Borrowers.
Only one Advance shall be made in any calendar month.

                  (c)      Retainage. The Bank shall retain an amount equal to
the Retainage on each Advance except for the final Advance. No interest shall
accrue on any such Retainage until disbursed to Borrower. The Retainage shall
not be disbursed until the Bank has received satisfactory evidence that the
Improvements have been completed in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications, all permits and licenses for the operation of the Replacement
Hospital on the Zell Miller Parkway Property have been issued, all items to be
delivered under Section 3.2 have been delivered, certification of USA Inspection

continuance of a Default, Bank shall have the option (but shall not be required
to give prior notice thereof to Borrowers) to accelerate the maturity of the
Note, to exercise any other rights or remedies hereunder in connection with the
exercise of this right, and, upon any such acceleration, to declare the interest
on the outstanding principal balance of the Note to be at the Default Rate from
and after the date of such Default and for so long as the same shall be

and applied by Bank, toward the repayment of the Note, or be paid over, wholly
or in part, to Borrowers for the repair or replacement of the improvements
located on the East Church Street Property or the Improvements, as the case may
be, or any part thereof, or for any other purpose or object satisfactory to
Bank, but Bank shall not be obligated to see to the proper application of any
amount paid over to Borrowers. If Bank, by reason of such insurance, receives
any money for loss or damage at a time when a Default shall not exist hereunder,
such amount shall be paid over to Borrowers for the repair or replacement of the
improvements located on the East Church Street Property or the Improvements, as
the case may be, or any part thereof, or for any other purpose or object
satisfactory to Bank, but Bank shall not be obligated to see to proper

general liability insurance, workman's compensation insurance, automobile
insurance for all vehicles owned by any Borrower and other insurance with such

a certificate holder (except as to worker's compensation, automobile and medical
malpractice insurance) and provide for thirty (30) days written notice to Bank
prior to the cancellation, expiration or termination thereof. Borrowers shall
deliver to Bank certificates of the aforesaid insurance.

         In the event of a foreclosure under one or more of the Security
Instruments, the purchaser shall, to the extent of any amounts then owing and
unpaid on the Loan, succeed to all the rights of Borrowers, including any right

notified within thirty (30) calendar days of the occurrence of such event,
provided that such Borrower shall give Bank notice of any failure to meet the
minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA,

                                    governmental body or agency, to which, in
                                    any such case, any of the Borrowers is
                                    subject or by which the Hospital or any of
                                    the assets or business of the Hospital are
                                    bound;

                           (iii)             contravene or result in a violation
                                    of any of the terms or requirements of any
                                    permit, license, certificate of need,
                                    accreditation, waiver, certificate, and
                                    governmental authorization that is held by
                                    any Borrower relating to and material to the
                                    use or operation of the Hospital or the
                                    business or assets of the Hospital;

                           (iv)              result in a material breach of, or
                                    constitute a default under any indenture,
                                    mortgage, lease, agreement, or other
                                    instrument to which any of the Borrowers is
                                    a party or by which the Hospital or any of
                                    its assets are bound; or

                           (v)               result in the imposition or
                                    creation of any lien upon any of the
                                    property or collateral under the Security
                                    Instruments in favor of any other than Bank.

         4.26     CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Except as otherwise expressly
contemplated hereby, no consent, order, approval, authorization, filing with or
action by any third party or governmental body or agency is required in
connection with the execution and delivery by Borrowers of the Agreement and the
other Loan Documents or the consummation by Borrowers of the loan transactions
contemplated herein.

         4.27     FINANCIAL RECORDS. Any and all financial statements delivered
by any and all of the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (collectively, the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"): (i) are in accordance with
the books and records of Borrowers, (ii) present fairly in accordance with GAAP,
in all material respects the financial condition of Borrowers and the Hospital
and the business and operations of Borrowers and the Hospital as of the
respective dates indicated and the results of operations for such periods, (iii)
have been


                                       22

<PAGE>

prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied throughout the periods
involved (with the exception of the absence of footnotes for unaudited
statements and subject to normal audit adjustments), (iv) reflect reserves
reasonably believed adequate by management of Borrowers for all known
liabilities and reasonably anticipated losses with respect to the Hospital and
the other property and collateral under the Security Instruments, (v) do not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact relating to their respective
businesses and assets or the Hospital, and (vi) do not contain any items of
special or nonrecurring income, or other income not earned in the ordinary
course of business relating to their respective businesses or assets or the
Hospital, except as set forth in the notes, if any, to the Financial Statements.

         4.28     PERMITS; CERTIFICATE OF NEED.

                  (a)      EXHIBIT "C" attached hereto and made a part hereof
contains a complete and accurate list of each permit, license, certificate of
need, accreditation, waiver, certificate, and governmental authorization held by
Borrowers that relates to the Hospital, or the business or assets of the
Hospital (the "PERMITS"). To the best knowledge and belief of Borrowers, the
Permits collectively constitute all of the Permits required under applicable law
for the ownership and use of the Hospital and it assets, and the operation of
business of the Hospital. Each Permit listed or required to be listed in EXHIBIT
"C" is valid and in full force and effect. To the best knowledge and belief of
Borrowers, the Hospital and the assets and the business of the Hospital are and
at all times have been, in compliance with all of the terms and requirements of
each Permit identified or required to be identified in EXHIBIT "C" except for
any noncompliance which has been remedied by Borrowers and would not have a
material adverse effect upon the business, assets or operation of the Hospital.
Each Permit has been duly obtained and (i) is not subject to any pending or to
Borrowers' knowledge, threatened administrative or judicial proceeding to
revoke, cancel, or declare such Permit invalid in any respect, and (ii) no event
has occurred which constitutes, or with due notice or lapse or time or both
would constitute, a material default by Borrowers under, or a violation of, any
Permit. Borrowers have received no notice of and have no knowledge of any
alleged violation of the terms of issuance of any Permit.

                  (b)      The Hospital, and the assets and the business of the
Hospital operate under a valid certificate of need or exemption from certificate
of need review and are otherwise in compliance with the certificate of need
laws. All representations made in connection with obtaining a certificate of
need or an exemption from or a waiver of certificate of need review for any
expenditure, service or project relating to the Hospital, and the assets or the
business of the Hospital (specifically including the certificate of need
approval held by Borrowers for the relocation of the Hospital (Project No. GA
047-98) to the Zell Miller Parkway Property) were and are accurate and
consistent with the basis for the granting of the certificate of need or the
determination that certificate of need review was not required. Borrowers have
taken no action and to Borrowers' best knowledge and belief no action has been
taken by any previous owner of the Hospital that has or is likely to subject
Borrowers, the Hospital, the assets or the business of the Hospital or any of
their services or equipment to certificate of need review or to penalties or
enforcement action under the certificate of need law. The certificate of need
approval held by Borrowers for the relocation of the Hospital (Project No. GA
047-98) is in good standing, and may be implemented according to its terms
without further certificate of need review, and Borrowers have taken all action
required to be taken in a timely manner to implement and


                                       23

<PAGE>

preserve the good standing of such certificate of need. Any appeal of the
certificate of need approval held by Borrowers for the relocation of the
Hospital (Project No. GA 047-98) has been dismissed with prejudice under terms
that will not subject the Hospital to any restrictions, costs, expenses,
liabilities or damages.

         4.29     GOVERNMENTAL BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY PAYORS.

                  (a)      The Hospital is duly certified to participate in, and
has provider agreements for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The Hospital is in material compliance with all of the terms, conditions and
provisions of such contracts, as well as state and federal laws related thereto.

                  (b)      All cost reports for the Hospital required to be
filed by Borrowers under the Medicare, Medicaid or other programs or any other
applicable governmental or private provider regulations have been, or by the
respective due date will be, prepared and filed in accordance with applicable
laws, rules and regulations, and Borrowers have paid or made provisions to pay
all Notices of Program Reimbursement received from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, tentative settlements and other adjustments for the Hospital for
periods ended prior to the Agreement Date. With respect to any cost reports for
the Hospital which remain to be filed or settled: (i) each will be timely filed
by Borrowers, (ii) to Borrowers' best knowledge and belief, each is or will be
complete and accurate in all material respects for the periods indicated, and
(iii) all liabilities associated with such filings have been or will be paid in
full by Borrowers. All liabilities and contractual adjustments of the Hospital
under any third party payor or reimbursement programs have been properly
reflected and reserved in a manner believed adequate by management of Borrowers
in the Financial Statements.

                  (c)      To the best of Borrowers' knowledge and belief,
Borrowers have not claimed or received reimbursements from the Medicare program,
the Medicaid program, TRICARE/CHAMPUS, or any other governmental health benefit
program in connection with the operation of the Hospital materially in excess of
the amounts permitted by law, except as and to the extent that liability for
such overpayment has already been satisfied in full. To the best of Borrowers'
knowledge and belief, Borrowers have not claimed or received reimbursements from
any private insurer, health maintenance organization, employer, or other payor
in connection with the operation of the Hospital materially in excess of the
amounts permitted by the applicable benefit plan or any applicable contract of
Borrowers with any such payor, except as to the extent that liability for such
overpayment has already been satisfied in full.

                  (d)      No notice of overpayment, false claims, civil money
penalties, or any offsets against future reimbursement has been received by
Borrowers in connection with the operation of the Hospital nor to Borrowers'
knowledge is there any basis therefor. There are no pending appeals,
adjustments, challenges, audits, litigation, notices of intent to reopen or open
cost reports in connection with the operation of the Hospital with respect to
the Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state governmental health care
programs. Borrowers have received no notice of pending, threatened or possible
decertification or other loss of participation in Medicare, Medicaid or any
other governmental health program. Other than regularly scheduled reviews, no
validation review, complaint review, peer review or program integrity review
related


                                       24

<PAGE>

to the Hospital has been conducted, scheduled, demanded or requested by any
entity, commission, board or agency in connection with Medicare, Medicaid or
other governmental health benefit program, and to Borrowers' knowledge, no such
reviews are threatened against or affecting the Hospital.

                  (e)      Borrowers have received no notice of any violation of
federal or state fraud and abuse or self-referral laws, or any investigation or
claim of such violation on the part of Borrowers in connection with the
operation of the Hospital, nor to Borrowers' best knowledge and belief have any
such laws been violated in connection with the operation of the Hospital. To
Borrowers' best knowledge and belief, no Borrower nor any manager, director,
governing body member, officer or employee of any Borrower, nor any other Person
acting on behalf of any Borrower, acting alone or together, has engaged in any
activities which are prohibited under the federal false claims and false
statements statutes (31 U.S.C. ss. 3729, 18 U.S.C. ss. 287, 18 U.S.C. ss. 1001),
the federal health care fraud statute (18 U.S.C. ss. 1387), or related state or
local statutes and regulations. To Borrowers' best knowledge and belief, all
claims for reimbursement presented to Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental
programs by Borrowers in connection with the operation of the Hospital have been
accurate and in compliance with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations
in all material respects.

                  (f)      Neither Borrowers, nor the Hospital, nor to
Borrowers' best knowledge and belief any member of the governing body, officer,
employee or agent of Borrowers or of the Hospital, nor any member of the medical
staff of the Hospital, (i) is or has been suspended, excluded, or otherwise
terminated from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS/TRICARE, or any
other federal or state governmental health benefit program; (ii) has been
convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction for any offense or has been
adjudicated to have liability for a civil monetary penalty which, in either
case, would allow or require the exclusion of Borrowers from participating in
federal healthcare programs or the Medicaid program.

         4.30     FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. To the best
knowledge and belief of Borrowers the Hospital and the business of the Hospital
are and have been conducted and operated by Borrowers in compliance with, and
Borrowers' contracts and financial arrangements with physicians and other
referral sources (including ownership interests and compensation relationships
between the Hospital and physicians as defined in 42 U.S.C. ss. 1395nn and
regulations adopted pursuant thereto) are in compliance with, the federal
statutes regarding kickbacks and health professional self-referrals in
connection with federal and state health care programs, 42 U.S.C. ss. 1320a-7b,
42 U.S.C. ss. 1395nn and 42 U.S.C. ss. 1396b, and the regulations promulgated
pursuant to such statutes, 42 U.S.C. ss. 1320a-7a(b) regarding payments to
induce reduction or limitation of services, and similar state and local statutes
and regulations, including without limitation the Georgia Patient Self-Referral
Act (O.C.G.A. ss. 43-1B-1 et seq.).

         4.31     JCAHO ACCREDITATION. The Hospital is duly accredited for
operation of its beds and services by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations ("JCAHO"). No Borrower has received notice with respect
to any threatened, pending or possible revocation, early termination, suspension
or limitation of JCAHO accreditation for the Hospital, nor, to Borrowers' best
knowledge and belief, are there any grounds for such action.

         4.32     COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

                  (a)      To Borrowers' best knowledge and belief, the Hospital
and the business of the Borrowers have been constructed, used, operated and
conducted in compliance with all constitutions, laws, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, and ordinances, of any governmental body or agency
exercising any authority or jurisdiction with respect to Borrowers, the
Hospital, or the business of Borrowers, including without limitation, those
relating to governmental program reimbursement, licensure of the Hospital and
the property, plant and equipment used therein, certificate of need, and
employee health and safety, except for any noncompliance which would not have a
material adverse effect upon the operation of the Hospital or Borrowers.

                  (b)      To Borrowers' best knowledge and belief, no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) (i) would constitute or result in a violation of, or a failure on the part
of any Borrower or the Hospital to comply with, any constitutions, laws,
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, ordinances, and policies of any
governmental body or agency applicable to the Borrowers, the Hospital, the
business of the Hospital, or any of the other property or collateral or property
described in the Security Instruments, except for any noncompliance which would
not have a material adverse effect upon the Hospital or Borrowers, or (ii) would
give rise to any obligation on the part of Borrowers or the Hospital to
undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any material remedial
action of any nature.

                  (c)      Borrowers have not received, and Borrowers have no
knowledge of, any notice or other communication (whether oral or written) from
any governmental body or agency regarding (i) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any federal, state, local,
municipal or other administrative order, constitution, law ordinance,
regulation, or statute, with respect to the Hospital, Borrowers, or the business
of the Hospital except to the extent that such violation or noncompliance would
not have a material adverse effect upon the Hospital, Borrowers, or the business
of the Hospital, or (ii) any actual, alleged, or potential obligation on the
part of Borrowers or the Hospital to undertake, or to bear all or any portion of
the cost of, any remedial action of any nature. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Borrowers have not received notice of any, and to Borrowers'
knowledge there exists no, violation of any zoning, land use, building code or
other similar laws, regulations or ordinances (including without limitation the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and ordinances and regulations applicable
thereto), and there do not exist any variances, conditional use permits, waivers
or exemptions relating to the Property or the Improvements with respect to such
matters, except to the extent that any such violation would not have a material
adverse effect upon the Hospital, Borrowers, or the business of the Hospital.

         4.33     CORRECTNESS OF REPRESENTATIONS. No representation or warranty
of Borrowers in this Agreement or any schedule, exhibit, certificate or
agreement attached hereto or furnished pursuant hereto or in any of the other
Loan Documents, contains, or on the date of any subsequent Advance hereunder
will contain, any untrue statement of material fact; and all such statements,
representations, warranties, exhibits, certificates, schedules and other Loan


                                       26

<PAGE>

Documents shall be true and complete in all material respects on and as of the

such principal, interest (including without limitation, interest which would
have accrued but for the commencement of a case or proceeding under the federal
bankruptcy laws), and other amounts payable under this Agreement or the Note
shall thereupon and concurrently therewith become due and payable, all without
any action by Bank, all without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are expressly waived, anything in this Agreement or in
the Note to the contrary notwithstanding.

                  (c)      Bank may exercise all of the post-default rights
granted to it and to them under the Loan Documents or under Applicable Law.

                  (d)      The rights and remedies of Bank hereunder shall be
cumulative, and not exclusive.

         5.3      WAIVERS. Neither a waiver of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder nor any representation by Bank as to the nonoccurrence or nonexistence
thereof shall be implied from any delay or omission by Bank to notify Borrowers
thereof or to take action on account of such Default or Event of Default, and no
express waiver shall affect any Default or Event of Default other than the
matter specified in the waiver and it shall be operative only for the time and
to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenants, terms or conditions
contained herein must be in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver of
any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. Bank's consent or
approval to or of any act by Borrowers requiring further consent or approval
shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to or
of any subsequent or similar act. Bank's exercise of any right or remedy or
hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of a Default or an
Event of Default, or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, or prejudice Bank in the
exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under the Note, the Security
Instruments or any other Loan Documents.

         5.4      CROSS-DEFAULT. The Note, Security Instruments and other Loan
Documents are "cross defaulted" such that (a) the occurrence of an Event of
Default under any one of the Loan Documents shall constitute an Event of Default
under this Agreement and all of the Loan Documents and (b) the occurrence of a
Default under any one of the Loan Documents shall constitute a Default under
this Agreement and all of the other Loan Documents.

         5.5      CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION. All Security Instruments and all
other Loan Documents, save the Guaranty and the Environmental Indemnity
Agreement, are "cross-collateralized" such that all of the Security Instruments
shall secure all of the obligations of Borrowers under the Note and the other
Loan Documents (save the Guaranty and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement).

for (i) the development of or construction of the Improvements, (ii) the failure
to develop or construct the Improvements in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications, (iii) the payment of any expense incurred in connection with the
development of or construction of the Improvements, (iv) the performance or

protection and benefit of Bank, Borrowers, and Bank's successors and assigns,
and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereon or rights
to the Loan proceeds at any time. Bank shall not (a) owe any duty whatsoever to
any claimant for labor performed or material furnished in connection with the
construction of the Improvements on the Property, or (b) owe any duty to apply
any undisbursed portion of the Loan to the payment of any claim, or (c) owe any
duty to exercise any right or power of Bank hereunder or arising from any
Default by Borrowers.

         6.2      ASSIGNMENT. The terms hereof shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns, and personal representatives
of the parties hereto; provided, however, that Borrowers shall not assign the
Loan Commitment or this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, duties or
obligations under the Loan Commitment or this Agreement or any Loan proceeds or
other monies to be advanced hereunder in whole or in part and any such
assignment (whether voluntary or by operation law) shall be void and render
automatically terminated any obligation of Bank hereunder to advance any further
monies pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Bank may assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Note, the Security
Instruments and any other Loan Documents, in whole or in part, to any other bank
or financial institution with a combined capital and surplus equivalent to at
least that of Bank, provided that all of the provisions hereof shall continue in
full force and effect and, in the event of such assignment, Bank shall
thereafter be relieved of all liability hereunder with respect to actions or
omissions of Bank occurring thereafter, but only to the extent of the interest
so assigned and any Loan disbursements made by any assignee(s) shall be deemed
made in pursuance and not in modification hereof and shall be evidenced by the
applicable Note and secured by the applicable Security Instrument and any other
Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent
of Borrowers, Bank shall not have the right to assign any portion of its
interest, rights or obligations hereunder to any other Person unless the
assignee shall assume all of the obligations of the assigning Bank under this
Agreement, to the extent of the interest so assigned. no assignment shall be
made to any other hospital, company or entity providing healthcare services to
the public. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2 to the contrary, Bank
may enter into participation agreements with any other Person, so long as such
agreement does not confer any rights under


                                       31

<PAGE>

this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to any purchaser thereof, or
relieve Bank from any of its obligations under this Agreement (it being
understood that all actions hereunder shall be conducted as if no such
participation had been granted).

         6.3      ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND AMENDMENTS. Bank shall be under no
obligation to extend any loan to Borrowers other than as specifically set forth
in this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be amended except by a written
instrument signed by all parties hereto which instrument contains a specific
reference to this Agreement.

         6.4      TERMS. Whenever the context and construction require, all
words used in the singular number herein shall be deemed to have been used in
the plural, and vice versa, and the masculine gender shall include the feminine
and neuter and the neuter shall include the masculine and feminine.

         6.5      GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, and such laws
shall govern the interpretation, construction and enforcement hereof. For the
purposes of any legal action or proceeding brought by Bank with respect to this
Agreement or the Loan Documents, Borrowers and Guarantor hereby irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia, and hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Mr. Robert M. Thornton,
Jr., 900 Circle 75 Parkway, Suite 1300, Atlanta, Georgia 30339, as their
authorized agent for service of process in the State of Georgia. Borrowers and
Guarantor also hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Loan Documents. Bank shall for all purposes be entitled to treat such designee
of Borrowers and Guarantor as the authorized agent to receive for or on their
respective behalf service of writs or summons or other legal process in Georgia;
delivery of such service to such authorized agent shall be deemed to be made
when delivered or mailed by certified mail addressed to such authorized agent,
with a copy to Borrowers and to Guarantor at the address of Borrowers' and the
address of Guarantor, as the case may be, last known to Bank, sent by overnight
delivery service. In the event that, for any reason, such agent or its successor
shall no longer serve as agent of Borrowers and Guarantors to receive service of
process in the State of Georgia, Borrowers and guarantor shall jointly establish
a successor so to serve, and shall advise Bank thereof, so that at all times
Borrowers and Guarantor will maintain an agent to receive service of process in
the State of Georgia on their respective behalf with respect to this Agreement
and the Loan Documents. In the event that, for any reason, service of legal
process cannot be made in the manner described above, such service may be made
in such other manner permitted by law. Borrowers and Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waive any objection they each might now or hereafter be entitled to
make with respect to the venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the Loan Documents which is brought in the
Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia or, at the election of Bank, in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, and Borrowers
and Guarantor hereby irrevocably waive any right to claim that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an incorrect
forum.

         6.6      PUBLICITY. Bank shall have the right to incorporate the name
of Bank into signage placed upon the Property during construction. Bank shall
have the right to secure printed publicity through newspaper and other media
concerning the Property and Hospital and source of financing. All such publicity
shall be submitted to Borrowers prior to its dissemination, and all such
publicity shall be subject to the prior written approval of Borrowers, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         6.7      ATTORNEYS' FEES. Borrowers shall pay on demand all reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses and other costs and expenses actually incurred by
Bank in the enforcement of or preservation of Bank's rights under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents in any such case after the occurrence and during
the continuance of a Default. To the full extent permitted by applicable law,
Borrowers agree to pay interest on any fees, costs or expenses due to Bank under
this Section 6.7 which are not paid when due at the Default Rate. In the event
that any Loan Document contains a provision regarding enforcement or
preservation of rights which is different from this Section 6.7, this Section
6.7 shall control.

         6.8      MANDATORY ARBITRATION. Any controversy or claim between or
among the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Loan
Documents or any related instruments including any claim based on or arising
from an alleged tort, shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance
with the Federal Arbitration Act (or, if not applicable, the applicable state
law), the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Arbitration of Commercial
Disputes of Endispute, Inc., doing business as J.A.M.S./Endispute ("J.A.M.S."),
as amended from time to time, and the "SPECIAL RULES" set forth below. In the
event of any inconsistency, the Special Rules shall control. Judgment upon any
arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any party to
this Agreement may bring an action, including a summary judgment or expedited
proceeding, to compel arbitration of any controversy or claim to which this
provision applies in any court having jurisdiction over such action.

                  (a)      Special Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in
the City of Atlanta, Georgia and administered by J.A.M.S. who will appoint an
arbitrator; if J.A.M.S. is unable or legally precluded from administering the
arbitration, then the American Arbitration Association will serve. All
arbitration hearings will be commenced within ninety (90) calendar days of the
demand for arbitration; further, the arbitrator shall only, upon a showing of
cause, be permitted to extend the commencement of such hearing for up to an
additional sixty (60) calendar days.

                  (b)      Reservation of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to (i) limit the applicability of any otherwise applicable
statutes of limitation or repose and any waivers contained in this Agreement; or
(ii) be a waiver by Bank of the protection afforded to it or them by 12 U.S.C.
Sec. 91 or any substantially equivalent state law; or (iii) limit the right of
Bank after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default (A) to
exercise self help remedies such as (but not limited to) setoff, or (B) to
foreclose against the Property, or (C) to obtain from a court provisional or
ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief or the appointment of a receiver.
After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, Bank may exercise
such self help remedies (including, without limitation, remedies under Section
5.2 hereof), foreclose upon the Property, or obtain such provisional or
ancillary remedies before, during or after the pendency of any arbitration
proceeding brought pursuant to this Loan Agreement. At


                                       33

<PAGE>

the option of Bank, foreclosure under a Security Instrument may be accomplished
by any of the following: the exercise of the power of sale under a Security
Instrument, or by judicial sale under a Security Instrument or by judicial
foreclosure. Neither the exercise of self help remedies nor the institution or
maintenance of an action for foreclosure or provisional or ancillary remedies
shall constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the claimant in
any such action to arbitrate the merits of the controversy or claim occasioning
resort to such remedies.

         No provision in this Agreement or any Loan Documents regarding
submission to jurisdiction and/or venue in any court is intended or shall be
construed to be in derogation of the provisions in this Agreement.

         6.9      INVALIDATION OF PROVISIONS. In the event that any one or more
of the provisions of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court having
jurisdiction over this Agreement or other similar authority, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered invalid or unenforceable, and
in lieu of any invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be automatically
substituted a valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

         6.10     EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         6.11     CAPTIONS. The captions herein are inserted only as a matter of
convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit or describe the scope
of this Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.

         6.12     NOTICES. All notices, requests, consents, demands and other
communications required or which any party desires to give hereunder or under
any other Loan Document shall, unless otherwise specifically provided in such
other Loan Document, be deemed sufficiently given or furnished if (a) in writing
and delivered by personal delivery, by courier, or by registered or certified
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the party to whom directed at
the addresses specified below (unless changed by similar notice in writing given
by the particular party whose address is to be changed), (b) by facsimile to the
facsimile number specified below with confirmation thereof in writing by sender
pursuant to subsection (a) above, or (d) by oral communication with confirmation
thereof in writing by the notifying party pursuant to subsection (a) above
delivered within three (3) Business Days after such oral communication. Any such
notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given and to be effective
either at the time of personal delivery or, in the case of courier or mail, as
of the date of first attempted delivery at the address and in the manner
provided herein, or, in the case of facsimile, upon receipt or, in the case of
oral communication, upon the effectiveness of written confirmation as
hereinabove provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of change of
address shall be effective except upon receipt. This Section shall not be
construed in any way to affect or impair any waiver of notice or demand provided
in any Loan Document or to require giving of notice or demand to or upon any
person in any situation or for any reason.
