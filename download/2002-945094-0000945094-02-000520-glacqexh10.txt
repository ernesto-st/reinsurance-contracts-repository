          state insurance laws when necessary.

          Underwriter such information with respect to the Separate Account and

4.   SALES MATERIALS

     (a)  After authorization to commence the activities contemplated herein,
          Principal Underwriter will utilize the currently effective prospectus

          literature or any other printed matter or material in the underwriting

5.   COMPENSATION

     (a)  Company agrees to pay Principal Underwriter for direct expenses
          incurred on behalf of Company. Such direct expenses shall include, but

          the number of Contracts to be sold by licensed broker-dealers and
          registered representatives of broker-dealers or the amount to be paid
          thereunder. Principal Underwriter does, however, represent that it

          state insurance laws when necessary.

     (e)  The Company reserves the right at any time to suspend or limit the

     (c)  During any legal action or inquiry, Company will furnish to Principal
          Underwriter such information with respect to the Separate Account and

9.   TERMINATION

     (a)  For an application received, or a policy issued directly by GLENBROOK
          and reinsured under this Agreement, net benefits are the actual
          amounts payable by GLENBROOK to the policyholder, less any amounts
          payable to GLENBROOK by another reinsurer with respect to the
          policy. These payments include, but are not limited to, death
          benefits, endowment

<Page>

          benefits, annuity benefits, disability benefits, benefits under
          accident and health policies, surrender benefits, and payments on
          supplemental contracts with and without life contingencies.

     (b)  For policies reinsured by GLENBROOK and retroceded under this
          Agreement, net benefits are the actual amounts payable by GLENBROOK to
          the ceding company with respect to the policy reinsured by GLENBROOK.
          These payments will include commissions and expense allowances on
          reinsurance accepted.

2.   With respect to applications received, or policies issued directly or
     reinsured by GLENBROOK, after the Effective Date of this Agreement,
     ALLSTATE's liability for net benefits will begin simultaneously with that
     of GLENBROOK and will include any liability GLENBROOK may incur as a result
     of a Temporary Insurance Agreement or Conditional Receipt issued in
     conjunction with a policy subject to this Agreement.

3.   ALLSTATE's liability under this Agreement will continue as long as
     GLENBROOK remains liable on the underlying coverage, and will terminate
     simultaneously with GLENBROOK's termination of liability.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                   SETTLEMENTS

1.   While this Agreement is in effect, GLENBROOK shall pay to ALLSTATE, no less
     frequently than weekly, with respect to policies reinsured under this
     Agreement, a reinsurance premium equal to (or the accounting equivalent of)
     the sum of Items (a), (b) and (c) below, less the sum of Items (d) and (e)
     below, as applicable for the period since the date of GLENBROOK's last
     payment to ALLSTATE.

     (a)  Gross premiums (direct and reinsurance assumed) collected by

     below, with respect to the policies reinsured under this Agreement, as
     applicable for the period since the date of ALLSTATE's last payment to

                                   OVERSIGHTS

ALLSTATE shall be bound as GLENBROOK is bound, and it is expressly understood
and agreed that if failure to reinsure or failure to comply with any terms of
this Agreement is shown to be unintentional and the result of misunderstanding
or oversight on the part of either GLENBROOK or ALLSTATE, both GLENBROOK and
ALLSTATE shall be restored to the positions they would have occupied had no such
error or oversight occurred.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                 POLICY CHANGES

1.   If a Policy reinsured under this Agreement becomes ineligible for
     reinsurance (as specified in Schedule A), the policy will be immediately
     recaptured by GLENBROOK.

2.   GLENBROOK shall notify ALLSTATE of any such recapture.

3.   Within ninety (90) days after receiving notice of recapture under
     paragraph 1 of this Article VI, ALLSTATE shall pay to GLENBROOK an amount
     equal to the net reserves attributable to the recaptured policy. Such
     reserves will be calculated as mutually agreed upon by GLENBROOK and
     ALLSTATE.

4.   Within ninety (90) days following the recapture by GLENBROOK of any
     business ceded to another reinsurer, GLENBROOK shall pay to ALLSTATE an
     amount equal to the net reserves attributable to the recaptured business.
     Such reserves will be calculated as mutually agreed upon by GLENBROOK and
     ALLSTATE.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              INSPECTION OF RECORDS

GLENBROOK and ALLSTATE shall have the right, at any reasonable time, to examine
at the office of the other, any books, documents, reports or records which
pertain in any way to the policies reinsured under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   INSOLVENCY

<Page>

2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of GLENBROOK, the liquidator,
     receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent GLENBROOK shall give
     written notice to ALLSTATE of the pendency of an obligation of the
     insolvent GLENBROOK on any policy reinsured, whereupon ALLSTATE may
     investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding
     where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may
     deem available to GLENBROOK or its liquidator or statutory successor. The
     expense thus incurred by ALLSTATE shall be chargeable, subject to court
     approval, against the insolvent GLENBROOK as part of the expenses of
     liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may
     accrue to GLENBROOK solely as a result of the defense undertaken by
     ALLSTATE.

3.   All monies due GLENBROOK or ALLSTATE under this Agreement shall be offset
     against each other, dollar for dollar, regardless of the insolvency of
     either party.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   ARBITRATION

Any dispute arising with respect to this Agreement which is not settled by
mutual agreement of the parties shall be referred to arbitration. Within twenty
(20) days from receipt of written notice from one party that an arbitrator has
been appointed, the other party will also name an arbitrator. The two
arbitrators will choose a third arbitrator and will forthwith notify the
contracting parties of such choice. Each arbitrator must be a present or former
officer of a life insurance company and must have no present or past affiliation
with this Agreement or with either party. The arbitrators will consider this
Agreement as an honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation,
and will be relieved of all judicial formalities. The decision of the
arbitrators will be final and binding upon the parties hereto. Each party shall
bear the expenses of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear the
expenses of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration. Any such arbitration
will take place at the Home Office of GLENBROOK, unless some other location is
mutually agreed upon.

                                    ARTICLE X

                              PARTIES TO AGREEMENT

This Agreement is solely between GLENBROOK and ALLSTATE. The acceptance of
reinsurance hereunder does not create any right or legal relation whatever
between ALLSTATE and any party in interest under any policy reinsured hereunder.

                                        5
<Page>

GLENBROOK shall be and remain solely liable to any insured, contract owner, or
beneficiary under any policy reinsured hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                              DURATION OF AGREEMENT

This Agreement is effective as of June 5, 1992, and is unlimited as to its
duration; provided, however, it may be terminated with respect to the
reinsurance of new business by either party giving sixty (60) days prior written
notice of termination to the other party.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties to this Agreement have caused it to be duly
executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the date shown below.

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     BETWEEN

            GLENBROOK LIFE AND ANNUITY COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "GLENBROOK")

                                       AND

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")

WHEREAS, Glenbrook and Allstate entered into a Coinsurance Agreement
(hereinafter "Agreement") having an effective date of June 5, 1992; and,

WHEREAS, the California Insurance Department has determined that various changes
to the Agreement are required under California insurance law; and,

WHEREAS, Glenbrook and Allstate desire to amend the Agreement with respect to
coverage issued to California residents to meet the California requirements;

NOW THEREFORE, the Agreement is hereby amended with respect to California
residents, as follows;

     1.) Article VIII, "INSOLVENCY", is hereby amended by deleting said Article
in its entirety, and replacing it with the following new Article VIII.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   INSOLVENCY

     1.   The portion of any risk or obligation assumed by Allstate, when such
          portion is ascertained, shall be payable on demand of Glenbrook at the
          same time as Glenbrook shall pay its net retained portion of such risk
          or obligation, and the reinsurance shall be payable by Allstate on the
          basis of the liability of Glenbrook under the contract or contracts
          reinsured under this Agreement without diminution because of the
          insolvency of Glenbrook. In the event of insolvency and the
          appointment of a conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of
          Glenbrook, such portion shall be payable to such conservator,
          liquidator or statutory successor immediately upon demand, on the
          basis of claims allowed against

<Page>

          Glenbrook by any court of competent jurisdiction or, by any
          conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of Glenbrook having
          authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of such
          insolvency or because such conservator, liquidator or statutory
          successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Payments
          by Allstate as above set forth shall be made directly to Glenbrook or
          its conservator, liquidator or statutory successor.

     2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of Glenbrook, the liquidator,
          receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent Glenbrook shall give
          written notice to Allstate of the pendency of an obligation of the
          insolvent Glenbrook on any policy reinsured, whereupon Allstate may
          investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the
          proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or
          defenses which it may deem available to Glenbrook or its liquidator or
          statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by Allstate shall be
          chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Glenbrook
          as part of the expenses of liquidation to the extent of a
          proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Glenbrook
          solely as a result of the defense undertaken by Allstate.

     2.)  Article IX, ARBITRATION, shall be amended to include the following
     language at the end of that article:

          The decision of the Arbitrators shall be handed down within 45 days of
          the date on which the arbitration is concluded.

     3.)  The second paragraph of Article X, PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT, shall be
     deleted in its entirety and shall be replaced with the following language:

          This Agreement shall be effective as of June 5, 1992,
          and will be unlimited as to its duration; provided,
          however, it may be terminated with respect to the
          reinsurance of new business by either party giving the
          other party ninety (90) days prior written notice of
          termination to the other party.

     4.)  In addition, a new Article XII is added to the Agreement, as follows:

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                     OFFSET

     All monies due Glenbrook or Allstate under this Agreement shall be offset
     against each other dollar for dollar.

<Page>

     5.)  Finally, a new Article XIII is added to the Agreement, as follows:

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                ENTIRE AGREEMENT

     This Agreement constitutes the entire contract between ALLSTATE
     and GLENBROOK. No variation, modification or changes to this
     Agreement shall binding unless in writing and signed by an
     officer of each party.

                          TO THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT
                             EFFECTIVE JUNE 5, 1992

                       GLENBROOK LIFE AND ANNUITY COMPANY

                                       AND

                        ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
                         (HEREINAFTER CALLED "ALLSTATE")


WHEREAS, GLENBROOK and ALLSTATE entered into a Reinsurance Agreement effective
June 5, 1992 (hereinafter "Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the parties now believe that the Agreement does not accurately reflect
their existing practices relating to settlements for certain tax benefits and
liabilities; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Agreement to reflect the existing
practices with respect to such tax settlements;

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED, that the Agreement is amended as provided
below.

     1.) Article III, paragraph 2, is amended by replacing subparagraph (d)
         with a new subparagraph (d), as follows:

          (d) Insurance taxes, licenses and fees (excluding Federal Income Tax
          that is not related to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement),
          incurred by GLENBROOK with respect to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement.

                                   Page 1 of 2
<Page>

     2.) Article III is further amended by adding a new paragraph 3, as follows:

          3.     No less frequently than quarterly, ALLSTATE will calculate the
          amount of federal and state income tax liabilities incurred by
          GLENBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement, and the amount of federal and state income tax
          benefits earned by GLENBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts
          reinsured under this Agreement. If tax liabilities exceed tax
          benefits, the difference, plus a gross-up for additional federal and
          state income taxes, will be paid by ALLSTATE to GLENBROOK. If tax

Exhibit 10.4

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     BETWEEN

            GLENBROOK LIFE AND ANNUITY COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "GLENBROOK")

                                       AND

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")

                                    ARTICLE I

                              BASIS OF REINSURANCE

1.   ALLSTATE will indemnify and GLENBROOK will automatically reinsure with
     ALLSTATE, according to the terms and conditions hereof, the net liability
     for applications received and contracts issued subsequent to the Effective
     Date by GLENBROOK on the contracts listed in Schedule A.

2.   The indemnity reinsurance provided hereunder shall be on a modified
     coinsurance basis. GLENBROOK shall retain, maintain, and own all assets
     held in relation to the Reserve, as defined in Article II of this
     Agreement.

3.   In no event will reinsurance on an application or a policy under this
     Agreement be in force unless the corresponding application is pending with
     GLENBROOK or policy issued by GLENBROOK, or the reinsurance accepted by
     GLENBROOK, as the case may be, is in force.

                                   ARTICLE II

                              LIABILITY OF ALLSTATE

1.   The liability of ALLSTATE with respect to any contract reinsured hereunder
     will begin simultaneously with that of GLENBROOK. ALLSTATE'S liability with
     respect to any contract reinsured hereunder will terminate on the date
     GLENBROOK'S liability on such contract terminates or the date this
     Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier. However, termination of this
     Agreement will not terminate ALLSTATE'S liability for benefit payments
     incurred prior to the date of termination.

<Page>

2.   For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Reserve" will be the "Total
     Liabilities" of GLENBROOK'S Variable Annuity Separate Accounts
     (corresponding to amounts shown on page 3, line 17 of 1992 Separate
     Accounts Statutory Statements).

                                   ARTICLE III

                               MONTHLY SETTLEMENTS

1.   While this Agreement is in effect, GLENBROOK shall pay to ALLSTATE on a
     daily basis, with respect to eligible policies under this Agreement, a
     reinsurance premium equal to the sum of Items (a) and (b) below, less the
     sum of Items (c) and (d) below.

     (a)  Gross premiums (direct and reinsurance assumed) collected by
          GLENBROOK.

     (b)  Reserves transferred from the GLENBROOK General Account to a
          GLENBROOK Separate Account.

     (d)  Reserves transferred from a GLENBROOK Separate Account to the
          GLENBROOK General Account.

2.   While this Agreement is in effect, ALLSTATE shall pay to GLENBROOK on a
     daily basis a benefit and expense allowance equal to the sum of Items (a),
     (b), (c), and (d) below.

     (a)  Net benefits (as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Article III) paid by
          GLENBROOK with respect to the contracts reinsured under this
          Agreement.

     (b)  Commissions and other sales compensation incurred by GLENBROOK with
          respect to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement.

     (c)  General insurance expenses incurred by GLENBROOK with respect to the
          contracts reinsured under this Agreement.

     (d)  Insurance taxes, licenses and fees (excluding Federal Income Tax)
          incurred by GLENBROOK with respect to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement.

3.   Net Benefits are defined as follows:

     (a)  For a contract issued directly by GLENBROOK and reinsured under this
          Agreement, net benefits are the actual amounts payable by GLENBROOK to
          the

                                        2
<Page>

          contractholder, less any amounts payable to GLENBROOK by another
          reinsurer with respect to the contract. These payments include death
          benefits, endowment benefits, annuity benefits, disability benefits,
          benefits under A & H policies, withdrawals, surrender benefits and
          payments on supplementary contracts with and without life
          contingencies.

     (b)  For contracts reinsured by GLENBROOK and retroceded under this
          Agreement, net benefits and commission and expense allowances are the
          actual amounts payable by GLENBROOK to the ceding company with respect
          to the contract reinsured by GLENBROOK.

4.   Allstate shall pay to GLENBROOK, no less frequently than annually, any
     taxes incurred by GLENBROOK as a result of Section 848 of the Internal
     Revenue Code which concerns capitalization of policy acquisition costs.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                            DAILY RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS

While this Agreement is in effect, on a daily basis a reserve adjustment equal
to the amount defined below shall be paid.

     Let:

          RC  =  The Reserve change in GLENBROOK'S Variable
                 Annuity Separate Accounts from the end of
                 the prior accounting period to the end of
                 the current accounting period for the
                 reinsured contracts (corresponding to the
                 sum of the amounts on page 4, lines 10, 11,
                 12 and 13 of 1992 Separate Account Statutory
                 Statements).

          NII =  The net investment income in GLENBROOK'S
                 Variable Annuity Separate Accounts
                 (corresponding to the sum of the amounts on
                 page 4, line 2 of 1992 Separate Account
                 Statutory Statements), minus interest
                 income on GLENBROOK'S capital investment in
                 Separate Accounts.

                                        3
<Page>

     If RC is greater than NII then a reserve adjustment of RC-NII is payable by
     ALLSTATE to GLENBROOK.

     If NII is greater than RC, then a reserve adjustment of NII-RC is payable
     by GLENBROOK to ALLSTATE.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                   OVERSIGHTS

ALLSTATE shall be bound as GLENBROOK is bound, and it is expressly understood
and agreed that if failure to reinsure or failure to comply with any terms of
this Agreement is shown to be unintentional and the result of misunderstanding
or oversight on the part of either GLENBROOK or ALLSTATE, both GLENBROOK and
ALLSTATE shall be restored to the positions they would have occupied had such
error or oversight not occurred.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              INSPECTION OF RECORDS

GLENBROOK and ALLSTATE shall have the right, at any reasonable time, to examine
at the office of the other, any books, documents, reports or records which
pertain in any way to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                   INSOLVENCY

1.   In the event of the insolvency of GLENBROOK, reinsurance hereunder is
     payable by ALLSTATE on the basis of its liability hereunder without
     diminution because of the insolvency of GLENBROOK.

2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of GLENBROOK, the liquidator,
     receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent GLENBROOK shall give
     written notice to ALLSTATE of the pendency of any obligation of the
     insolvent GLENBROOK on any policy reinsured, whereupon ALLSTATE may
     investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the proceeding
     where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may
     deem available to GLENBROOK or its liquidator or statutory

                                        4
<Page>

     successor. The expense thus incurred by ALLSTATE shall be chargeable,
     subject to court approval, against the insolvent GLENBROOK as part of the
     expenses of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the
     benefit which may accrue to GLENBROOK solely as a result of the defense
     undertaken by ALLSTATE.

3.   All moneys due GLENBROOK or ALLSTATE under this agreement shall be offset
     against each other, dollar for dollar, regardless of any insolvency of
     either party.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   ARBITRATION

Any dispute arising with respect to this Agreement which is not settled by
mutual agreement of the parties shall be referred to arbitration. Within twenty
(20) days from receipt of written notice from one party that an arbitrator has
been appointed, the other party will also name an arbitrator. The two
arbitrators shall choose a third arbitrator and shall forthwith notify the
contracting parties of such choice. Each arbitrator shall be a present or former
officer of a life insurance company and should have no present or past
affiliation with this Agreement or with either party. The arbitrators shall
consider this Agreement as an honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal
obligation, and shall be relieved of all judicial formalities. The decision of
the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. Each party
shall bear the expenses of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear
the expenses of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration. Any such
arbitration shall take place at the Home Office of GLENBROOK, unless some other
location is mutually agreed upon.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                              PARTIES TO AGREEMENT

This agreement is solely between GLENBROOK and ALLSTATE. The acceptance of
reinsurance hereunder shall not create any right or legal relation whatever
between ALLSTATE and any party in interest under any contract of GLENBROOK
reinsured hereunder. GLENBROOK shall be and remain solely liable to any insured,
contract owner, or beneficiary under any contract reinsured hereunder.

respect to the reinsurance of new business by either party giving sixty (60)
days prior written notice of termination.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                ENTIRE AGREEMENT

                              REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

                                     BETWEEN

            GLENBROOK LIFE AND ANNUITY COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "GLENBROOK")

                                       AND

              ALLSTATE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHBROOK, ILLINOIS
                            (HEREINAFTER "ALLSTATE")


WHEREAS, Glenbrook and Allstate entered into a Modified Coinsurance Agreement
(hereinafter "Agreement") having an effective date of September 1, 1993; and,

WHEREAS, the California Insurance Department has determined that various changes
to the Agreement are required under California insurance law; and,

WHEREAS, Glenbrook and Allstate desire to amend the Agreement with respect to
coverage issued to California residents to meet the California requirements;

NOW THEREFORE, the Agreement is hereby amended with respect to California
residents, as follows;

     1.) Article VII, "INSOLVENCY", is hereby amended by deleting said Article
in its entirety, and replacing it with the following new Article VII:

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                   INSOLVENCY

     1.   The portion of any risk or obligation assumed by Allstate, when such
          portion is ascertained, shall be payable on demand of Glenbrook at the
          same time as Glenbrook shall pay its net retained portion of such risk
          or obligation, and the reinsurance shall be payable by Allstate on the
          basis of the liability of Glenbrook under the contract or contracts
          reinsured under this Agreement without diminution because of the
          insolvency of Glenbrook. In the event of insolvency and the
          appointment of a conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of
          Glenbrook, such portion shall be payable to such conservator,
          liquidator or statutory successor immediately upon demand, on the
          basis of claims allowed against

<Page>

          Glenbrook by any court of competent jurisdiction or, by any
          conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor of Glenbrook having
          authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of such
          insolvency or because such conservator, liquidator or statutory
          successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Payments
          by Allstate as above set forth shall be made directly to Glenbrook or
          its conservator, liquidator or statutory successor.

     2.   Further, in the event of the insolvency of Glenbrook, the liquidator,
          receiver or statutory successor of the insolvent Glenbrook shall give
          written notice to Allstate of the pendency of an obligation of the
          insolvent Glenbrook on any policy reinsured, whereupon Allstate may
          investigate such claim and interpose at its own expense, in the
          proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or
          defenses which it may deem available to Glenbrook or its liquidator or
          statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by Allstate shall be
          chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Glenbrook
          as part of the expenses of liquidation to the extent of a
          proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Glenbrook
          solely as a result of the defense undertaken by Allstate.

     2.)  Article VIII, ARBITRATION, shall be amended to include the following
     language at the end of that article:

          The decision of the Arbitrators shall be handed down
          within 45 days of the date on which the arbitration is
          concluded.

     3.)  Article X, DURATION OF THE AGREEMENT, shall be deleted in its entirety
     and shall be replaced with the following language:

          This Agreement shall be effective as of September 1, 1993,
          and will be unlimited as to its duration; provided,
          however, it may be terminated with respect to the
          reinsurance of new business by either party giving the
          other party ninety (90) days prior written notice of
          termination to the other party.

     4.)  In addition, a new Article XII is added to the Agreement, as follows:

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                     OFFSET

     All monies due Glenbrook or Allstate under this Agreement shall be offset
     against each other dollar for dollar.

<Page>

     5.) Finally, the definition of "RC" contained in Article IV, DAILY RESERVE
ADJUSTMENTS, shall be deleted and replaced with the following language:

     RC = The Reserve change in GLENBROOK'S Variable Annuity
     Separate Accounts from the end of the prior accounting
     period to the end of the current accounting period for the
     reinsured contracts (corresponding to the sum of the amounts
     on page 4, lines 10, 11, 12, and 13 of 1992 Separate Account
     Statutory Statements). An accounting period shall be defined
     as one day.

This amendment shall be effective __________, 1995. Except as amended hereby,
the Agreement shall remain unchanged.

duly executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the dates shown

WHEREAS, GLENBROOK and ALLSTATE entered into a Reinsurance Agreement effective
September 1, 1993 (hereinafter "Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the parties now believe that the Agreement does not accurately reflect
their existing practices relating to settlements for certain tax benefits and
liabilities; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Agreement to reflect the existing
practices with respect to such tax settlements;

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED, that the Agreement is amended as provided
below.

     1.) Article III, paragraph 2, is amended by replacing subparagraph (d) with
        a new subparagraph (d), as follows:

          (d) Insurance taxes, licenses and fees (excluding Federal Income Tax
          that is not related to the contracts reinsured under this Agreement ),
          incurred by GLENBROOK with respect to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement.

     2.) Article III is further amended by adding a new paragraph 5, as follows:

          5.     No less frequently than quarterly, ALLSTATE will calculate the

                                   Page 1 of 2

          amount of federal and state income tax liabilities incurred by
          GLENBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts reinsured under
          this Agreement, and the amount of federal and state income tax
          benefits earned by GLENBROOK for the quarter related to the contracts
          reinsured under this Agreement. If tax liabilities exceed tax
          benefits, the difference, plus a gross-up for additional federal and
          state income taxes, will be paid by ALLSTATE to GLENBROOK. If tax
          benefits exceed tax liabilities, the difference, plus a gross-up for
          additional federal and state income taxes, will be paid by GLENBROOK
          to ALLSTATE.

Except as amended hereby, the Agreement shall remain unchanged.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties to the Agreement have caused this Amendment to be
duly executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the dates shown
below.
