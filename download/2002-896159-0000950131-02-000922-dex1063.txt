         Credit is to be issued (which shall be a Letter of Credit Business

         Agent; and

             (ii) in the case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, delivering
         to the Issuing Bank a completed agreement and application with respect
         to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank may specify for use in

         Agreement or as may be required pursuant to the Issuing Bank's
         customary practices for the issuance of letters of credit (including
         requirements relating to requests made through the Issuing Bank's
         remote access system).

In addition, the applicable Account Party shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent a Collateral Value Report not later than 11:00 A.M. Charlotte, North
Carolina time on the Letter of Credit Business Day immediately preceding the
date on which such Letter of Credit is to be issued.

The Administrative Agent shall, promptly upon receiving a copy of the notice
referred to in clause (i) above, notify the Banks of such proposed Letter of
Credit (which notice shall specify the Available Amount and term of such
proposed Letter of Credit) or such proposed renewal of a Letter of Credit (which
notice shall specify the term of such renewal), and shall determine, as of 11:00
A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day immediately preceding

limitations set forth in Section 2.01 hereof. If such limitations set forth in
Section 2.01 are not satisfied or if the Required Banks have given notice to the
Administrative Agent to cease issuing or renewing Letters of Credit as
contemplated by this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall immediately
notify the Issuing Bank (in writing or by telephone immediately confirmed in
writing) that the Issuing Bank is not authorized to issue or renew, as the case

Credit, it shall deliver the original of such Letter of Credit to the
beneficiary thereof or as the Applicable Account Party shall otherwise direct,
and shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof and furnish a copy
thereof to the Administrative Agent. The Issuing Bank may issue Letters of
Credit through any of its branches or Affiliates (whether domestic or foreign)
that issue letters of credit, and each Account Party authorizes and directs the
Issuing Bank to select the branch or Affiliate that will issue or process any
Letter of Credit.

         (b) Request for Extension or Increase. An Account Party may from time
             ---------------------------------
to time request the Issuing Bank to extend the expiration date of an outstanding
Letter of Credit issued for its account or increase (or, with the consent of the
beneficiary, decrease) the Available Amount of or the amount available to be
drawn on such Letter of Credit. Such extension or increase shall for all
purposes hereunder (including for purposes of Section 2.02(a)) be treated as
though such Account Party had requested issuance of a replacement Letter of
Credit (except only

                                       18

<PAGE>

that the Issuing Bank may, if it elects, issue a notice of extension or
increase in lieu of issuing a new Letter of Credit in substitution for the
outstanding Letter of Credit).

         (c) Limitations on Issuance, Extension, Renewal and Amendment. As
             ---------------------------------------------------------
between the Issuing Bank, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Banks, on the
other hand, the Issuing Bank shall be justified and fully protected in issuing
or renewing a proposed Letter of Credit unless it shall have received notice
from the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.02(a) hereof that it is
not authorized to do so (and, in the case of automatic renewals, ten days shall
have passed following the date of the Issuing Bank's receipt of such notice),
notwithstanding any subsequent notices to the Issuing Bank, any knowledge of a
Default, any knowledge of failure of any condition specified in Article III
hereof to be satisfied, any other knowledge of the Issuing Bank, or any other
event, condition or circumstance whatsoever. The Issuing Bank may amend, modify
or supplement Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Agreements, or waive
compliance with any condition of issuance, renewal or payment, without the
consent of, and without liability to, any Agent or any Bank, provided that any
                                                             --------
such amendment, modification or supplement that extends the expiration date or
increases the Available Amount of or the amount available to be drawn on an
outstanding Letter of Credit shall be subject to Section 2.01.

         (d) Letter of Credit Participating Interests. Concurrently with the
             ----------------------------------------
issuance of each Letter of Credit (and upon the Effective Date, with respect to
each Existing Letter of Credit, and without any further action by any party to
this Agreement), the Issuing Bank automatically shall be deemed, irrevocably and
unconditionally, to have sold, assigned, transferred and conveyed to each other
Bank, and each other Bank automatically shall be deemed, irrevocably and
unconditionally, severally to have purchased, acquired, accepted and assumed
from the Issuing Bank, without recourse to, or representation or warranty by,
the Issuing Bank, an undivided interest, in a proportion equal to such Bank's
Pro Rata Share, in all of the Issuing Bank's rights and obligations in, to or
under such Letter of Credit, the related Letter of Credit Agreement, all
reimbursement obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit, and all
Collateral, guarantees and other rights from time to time directly or indirectly
securing the foregoing (such interest of each Bank being referred to herein as a
"Letter of Credit Participating Interest", it being understood that the Letter
 ---------------------------------------
of Credit Participating Interest of the Issuing Bank is the interest not
otherwise attributable to the Letter of Credit Participating Interests of the
other Banks). Each Bank irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to the
immediately preceding sentence, such agreement being herein referred to as such
Bank's "Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitment". Amounts, other than
        --------------------------------------------------
Letter of Credit Advances made by a Bank other than the Issuing Bank and other
than Letter of Credit commissions under Section 2.05(c)(i), payable from time to
time under or in connection with a Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Agreement shall be for the sole account of the Issuing Bank. On the date that
any assignee becomes a party to this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.07
hereof, Letter of Credit Participating Interests in all outstanding Letters of
Credit held by the Bank from which such assignee acquired its interest hereunder
shall be proportionately reallocated between such assignee and such assignor
Bank (and, to the extent such assignor Bank is the Issuing Bank, the assignee
Bank shall be deemed to have acquired a Letter of Credit Participating Interest
from the Issuing Bank to such extent). Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, each Bank hereby agrees that its obligation to participate in each
Letter of Credit, its obligation to make the payments specified in Section
2.02(e), and the right of the Issuing Bank to receive such payments in the
manner specified therein, are each absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and
shall not be affected by

                                       19

<PAGE>

any event, condition or circumstance whatever. The failure of any Bank to make
any such payment shall not relieve any other Bank of its funding obligation
hereunder on the date due, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Bank to meet its funding obligations hereunder.

         (e) Payment by Banks on Account of Unreimbursed Draws. If the Issuing
             -------------------------------------------------
Bank makes a payment under any Letter of Credit and is not reimbursed in full
therefor on such payment date in accordance with Section 2.03(a), the Issuing
Bank may notify the Administrative Agent thereof (which notice may be by
telephone), and the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify each Bank (which
notice may be by telephone promptly confirmed in writing) thereof. No later than
the Administrative Agent's close of business on the date such notice is given
(if notice is given by 2:00 P.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time) or 10:00 A.M.
Charlotte, North Carolina time the following day (if notice is given after 2:00
P.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time or in the case of any Bank whose Applicable
Lending Office is located in Europe), each Bank will pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds, an
amount equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the unreimbursed portion of such
payment by the Issuing Bank. Amounts received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Issuing Bank shall be forthwith transferred, in immediately
available funds, to the Issuing Bank. If and to the extent that any Bank fails
to make such payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Bank on such date, such Bank shall pay such amount on demand, together with
interest, for the Issuing Bank's own account, for each day from and including
the date such payment is due from such Bank to the Issuing Bank to but not
including the date of repayment to the Issuing Bank (before and after judgment)
at a rate per annum for each day (i) from and including the date such payment is
due from such Bank to the Issuing Bank to and including the second Business Day
thereafter equal to the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) thereafter equal to the Base
Rate.

         (f) Letter of Credit Advances. The term "Letter of Credit Advance" is
             -------------------------            ------------------------
used in this Agreement in accordance with the meanings set forth in this
paragraph 2.02(f). The making of any payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter
of Credit is sometimes referred to herein as the making of a Letter of Credit
Advance by the Issuing Bank in the amount of such payment. The making of any
payment by a Bank for the account of the Issuing Bank under Section 2.02(e) on
account of an unreimbursed drawing on a Letter of Credit is sometimes referred
to herein as the making of a Letter of Credit Advance to the Applicable Account
Party by such Bank. The making of such a Letter of Credit Advance by a Bank with
respect to an unreimbursed drawing on a Letter of Credit shall reduce, by a like
amount, the outstanding Letter of Credit Advance of the Issuing Bank with
respect to such unreimbursed drawing.

         (g) Letter of Credit Reports. The Issuing Bank will furnish to the
             ------------------------
Administrative Agent prompt written notice of each issuance or renewal of a
Letter of Credit (including the Available Amount and expiration date thereof),
amendment to a Letter of Credit, cancellation of a Letter of Credit and payment
on a Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent will furnish (A) to each Bank
prior to the tenth Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report
summarizing issuance, renewal and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued
or renewed during the preceding calendar quarter and payments and reductions in
Available Amount during such calendar quarter on all Letters of Credit and (B)
to each Bank prior to the tenth Business

                                       20

Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average
daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all
Letters of Credit.

         SECTION 2.03 Repayment of Advances.
                      ---------------------

         (a)  Account Parties' Reimbursement Obligation.
              -----------------------------------------

               (i) Each Account Party hereby agrees to reimburse the Issuing
          Bank (by making payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of
          the Issuing Bank in accordance with Section 2.07) in the amount of
          each payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
          issued for such Account Party's account, such reimbursement to be made
          on the date such payment under such Letter of Credit is made by the
          Issuing Bank (but not earlier than the date which is one Business Day
          after notice of such payment under such Letter of Credit or of the
          drawing giving rise to such payment under such Letter of Credit is
          given to such Account Party). Such reimbursement obligation shall be
          payable without further notice, protest or demand, all of which are
          hereby waived, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. To the
          extent such payment by such Account Party is not timely made as
          provided in the first sentence of this clause (i), (x) such Account
          Party hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
          respective accounts of the Issuing Bank and the Banks which have
          funded their respective shares of such amount remaining unpaid by such
          Account Party, on demand, interest thereon at a rate per annum for
          each day equal to 2% plus the Base Rate in effect on such day, and (y)
          each Account Party shall be deemed to have delivered an irrevocable
          and continuing Letter of Instruction to the Administrative Agent
          (which each Account Party hereby irrevocably authorizes the
          Administrative Agent to date the date that such payment to the
          Administrative Agent is due and payable and to deliver to the Persons
          identified therein) instructing the Administrative Agent to obtain,
          receive and apply at or after such time such part of the Collateral or
          the proceeds thereof as is equivalent to such reimbursement obligation
          and any interest thereon that may accrue prior to such application.

             (ii) The obligation of each Account Party to reimburse the Issuing
         Bank for any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of
         Credit, and the obligation of each Bank under Section 2.02(e) with
         respect thereto, shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
         paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
         applicable Letter of Credit Agreement and any other applicable
         agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including, without
         limitation, the following circumstances:

                  (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
             Document, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or
             any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the
             foregoing being, collectively, the "L/C Related Documents");
                                                 ---------------------

                  (B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
             in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of any Account
             Party or any other Person in respect of any L/C Related Document or
             any other amendment or

                                       21

<PAGE>

             waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C
             Related Documents;

                  (C) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
             right that any Account Party or any other Person may have at any
             time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of
             Credit (or any Persons for which any such beneficiary or any such
             transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person,
             whether in connection with the transactions contemplated by the L/C
             Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

                  (D) any statement or any other document presented under a
             Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
             insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue
             or inaccurate in any respect;

                  (E) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
             against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
             strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                  (F) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral,
             or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure
             from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the
             obligations of any Account Party or any other Person in respect of
             the L/C Related Documents; or

                  (G) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
             not similar to any of the foregoing, including, without limitation,
             any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense
             available to, or a discharge of, any Account Party or a guarantor.

         (b) Rescission. If any amount received by the Issuing Bank on account
             ----------
of any Letter of Credit Advance shall be avoided, rescinded or otherwise
returned or paid over by the Issuing Bank for any reason at any time, whether
before or after the termination of this Agreement (or the Issuing Bank believes
in good faith that such avoidance, rescission, return or payment is required,
whether or not such matter has been adjudicated), each Bank will (except to the
extent a corresponding amount received by such Bank on account of its Letter of
Credit Advance relating to the same payment on a Letter of Credit has been
avoided, rescinded or otherwise returned or paid over by such Bank), promptly
upon notice from the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, pay over to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share of
such amount, together with its Pro Rata Share of any interest or penalties
payable with respect thereto.

         SECTION 2.04   Termination or Reduction of the LC Commitment Amounts.
                        -----------------------------------------------------
The Parent may, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Administrative
Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portion of the LC
Commitment Amounts; provided, however, that each partial reduction (i) shall be
                    --------  -------
in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof, (ii) shall be made ratably among the Banks in accordance with
their LC Commitment Amounts and (iii) shall automatically reduce the Issuing

                                       22

<PAGE>

Bank's Letter of Credit Issuance Commitment Amount, as contemplated by the
definition of that term.

         SECTION 2.05 Fees.
                      ----

         (a) Commitment Fee. The Account Parties jointly and severally agree to
             --------------
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks a commitment fee,
from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Bank and from the effective
date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a
Bank in the case of each other Bank until the Expiration Date, payable in
arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December commencing December 31, 2001 and on the Expiration Date, at a rate
equal to 0.08% per annum on the average daily Unused LC Commitment Amount of
each Bank during such quarter (or shorter period); provided, however, that no
                                                   --------  -------
commitment fee shall accrue on the LC Commitment Amount of a Defaulting Bank so
long as such Bank shall be a Defaulting Bank.

         (b) Administrative Agent's Fees. The Account Parties jointly and
             ---------------------------
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account such fees
as may from time to time be agreed between the Parent and the Administrative
Agent.

         (c) Letter of Credit Fees, Etc.
             ---------------------------

             (i)   The Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a commission, payable
         in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June,
         September and December commencing December 31, 2001 and on the
         Expiration Date, on such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the average daily
         aggregate Available Amount during such quarter (or shorter period) of
         all Letters of Credit outstanding from time to time at a rate equal to
         0.30% per annum.

             (ii)  The Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay to the
         Issuing Bank, for its own account, (x) the facing fee referred to the
         Fee Letter, on the terms set forth therein, and (y) the Issuing Bank's
         customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees,
         and other standard costs and charges, relating to letters of credit as
         are from time to time in effect. With respect to the Existing Letters
         of Credit, First Union shall be entitled to receive the fees and other
         amounts provided for under this Section 2.05(c)(ii) (to the extent not
         previously paid to First Union) as if the Existing Letters of Credit
         were issued hereunder on the Effective Date.

             (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
         2.05(c), until the Tempest Life Effective Date, Tempest Life shall be
         obligated under this Section 2.05(c) only for the portion of such fees,
         commissions and charges allocable or attributable to Letters of Credit
         issued for its own account.

         SECTION 2.06   Increased Costs, Etc.
                        --------------------

         (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of, in each case after the date hereof, any law or regulation
or (ii) the compliance with any guideline

                                       23

<PAGE>

or request issued after the date hereof from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to issue or of issuing or
maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit or the making of Letter of
Credit Advances (excluding, for purposes of this Section 2.06, any such
increased costs resulting from (x) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section
2.08 shall govern) and (y) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net
income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign
jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Bank is organized or has its
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the
Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay, from time to time, within
five days after demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), which demand shall include a statement of the basis for
such demand and a calculation in reasonable detail of the amount demanded, to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost. A certificate as to
the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Account Parties by such
Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof,
or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued after the date
hereof from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling
such Bank as a result of or based upon the existence of such Bank's commitment
to lend hereunder and other commitments of such type, then, within five days
after demand by such Bank or such corporation (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), which demand shall include a statement of the basis for
such demand and a calculation in reasonable detail of the amount demanded, the
Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank in the light of such
circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase
in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Bank's commitment to issue
or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance
of or participation in any Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such amounts
submitted to the Account Parties by such Bank shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (c) Each Bank shall promptly notify the Account Parties and the
Administrative Agent of any event of which it has actual knowledge which will
result in, and will use reasonable commercial efforts available to it (and not,
in such Bank's good faith judgment, otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank) to
mitigate or avoid any obligation by the Account Parties to pay any amount
pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) above or pursuant to Section 2.08 (and, if any
Bank has given notice of any such event and thereafter such event ceases to
exist, such Bank shall promptly so notify the Account Parties and the
Administrative Agent). Without limiting the foregoing, each Bank will designate
a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid (or reduce
the cost to the Account Parties of) any event described in the preceding
sentence and such designation will not, in such Bank's good faith judgment, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

                                       24

<PAGE>

     (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above or
Section 2.08 (and without limiting subsection (c) above), if any Bank fails to
notify the Account Parties of any event or circumstance that will entitle such
Bank to compensation pursuant subsection (a) or (b) above or Section 2.08 within
120 days after such Bank obtains actual knowledge of such event or circumstance,
then such Bank shall not be entitled to compensation from the Account Parties
for any amount arising prior to the date which is 120 days before the date on
which such Bank notifies the Account Parties of such event or circumstance. For
avoidance of doubt, it is noted that the term "Bank" as used in this Section
2.06 and in other Sections of this Agreement includes the Issuing Bank in its
capacity as such.

     SECTION 2.07 Payments and Computations.
                  -------------------------

     (a) The Account Parties shall make each payment hereunder irrespective of
any right of counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section
2.11), not later than 11:00 A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the day
when due, in U.S. dollars, to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account in same day funds, with payments being received by the
Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter
cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by such Account Party is
in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other amount then
payable hereunder to more than one Bank, to such Banks for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of
such respective amount then payable to such Banks and (ii) if such payment by
such Account Party is in respect of any amount then payable hereunder to one
Bank, to such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each
case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after
the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent
shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to
the Bank assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance
shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to
such effective date directly between themselves.

     (b) Each Account Party hereby authorizes each Bank, if an Event of Default
under Section 6.01(a) has occurred and is continuing, to charge from time to
time against any or all of such Account Party's accounts with such Bank any
amount that resulted in such Event of Default.

     (c) All computations of interest on Letter of Credit Advances (and any
other amount payable by reference to the Base Rate) when the Base Rate is
determined by reference to First Union's prime rate shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or, if applicable, 366 days;
all other computations of interest, fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall
be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days. All such
computations shall be made for the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest,
fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.


                                       25

<PAGE>

     (d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other
than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business
Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of payment of interest or fee, as the case may be.

     SECTION 2.08 Taxes.
                  -----

     (a) Any and all payments by any Loan Party hereunder shall be made, in
accordance with Section 2.07, free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case
of each Bank and each Agent, taxes that are imposed on its overall net income by
the United States and taxes that are imposed on its overall net income (and
franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction
under the laws of which such Bank or such Agent, as the case may be, is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank,
taxes that are imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in
lieu thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Bank's Applicable
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in
respect of payments hereunder being herein referred to as "Taxes"). If any Loan
                                                           -----
Party shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder or to any Bank or any Agent, (i) the sum payable by such Loan
Party shall be increased as may be necessary so that after such Loan Party and
the Administrative Agent have made all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Bank or such
Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make all
such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law.

     (b) In addition, each Loan Party shall pay any present or future stamp,
documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise
from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration
of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document (herein referred to as "Other Taxes").
                                      -----------

     (c) Each Loan Party shall indemnify each Bank and each Agent for and hold
them harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the full
amount of taxes of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section 2.08, imposed on or paid by such Bank or such Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification
payment shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank or such Agent (as
the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

     (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each Loan Party
shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section
9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. In
the case of any payment hereunder by or on behalf of a Loan Party through an
account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of a Loan Party
by a payor that is not a United States person, if such Loan Party determines
that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Loan Party shall furnish, or
shall


                                       26

<PAGE>

cause such payor to furnish, to the Administrative Agent, at such address, an
opinion of counsel acceptable to the Administrative Agent stating that such
payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of subsections (d) and (e) of this
Section 2.08, the terms "United States" and "United States person" shall have
the meanings specified in Section 7701(a)(9) and 7701(a)(10) of the Internal
Revenue Code, respectively.

     (e) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United
States shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, and from time to time thereafter
as requested in writing by the Parent (but only so long thereafter as such Bank
remains lawfully able to do so), provide each of the Administrative Agent and
the Parent with two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI or
(in the case of a Bank that has certified in writing to the Administrative Agent
that it is not a "bank" as defined in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal
Revenue Code) form W-8 (and, if such Bank delivers a form W-8, a certificate
representing that such Bank is not a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Internal Revenue Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the
meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of the Parent and
is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Parent (within the
meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code)), as appropriate, or
any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service,
certifying that such Bank is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United
States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or, in the case of
a Bank providing a form W-8, certifying that such Bank is a foreign corporation,
partnership, estate or trust. If the forms provided by a Bank at the time such
Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest
withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be
considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Bank provides the
appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods
governed by such forms; provided, however, that if, at the effective date of the
                        --------  -------
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Bank becomes a party to this
Agreement, the Bank assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of
this Section 2.08 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include
(in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other
amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any,
applicable with respect to the Bank assignee on such date. If any form or
document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN,
W-8ECI or W-8 (and the related certificate described above), that the Bank
reasonably considers to be confidential, the Bank shall give notice thereof to
the Parent and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such
confidential information.

     (f) For any period with respect to which a Bank which may lawfully do so
has failed to provide the Parent with the appropriate form described in
subsection (e) above (other than if such failure is due to a change in law
occurring after the date on which a form originally was required to be provided
or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such Bank
shall not be entitled to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) of this
Section 2.08 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of
such failure; provided, however,
              --------  -------

that should a Bank become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver
a form required hereunder, the Parent shall take such steps as such Bank shall
reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

     (g) Each Bank represents and warrants to the Account Parties that, as of
the date such Bank becomes a party to this Agreement, such Bank is entitled to
receive payments hereunder from the Account Parties without deduction or
withholding for or on account of any Taxes.

     SECTION 2.09 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain at any time
                  ------------------------
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment pursuant to
Section 9.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to such Bank
hereunder at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Bank at
such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all
Banks hereunder at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and
payable to all Banks hereunder at such time obtained by all the Banks at such
time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such
Bank hereunder at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Bank at such time
to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable)
to all Banks hereunder at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to all Banks hereunder at such time obtained by
all of the Banks at such time, such Bank shall forthwith purchase from the other
Banks such interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and
payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause
such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
--------  -------
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each other
Bank shall be rescinded and such other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank
the purchase price to the extent of such Bank's ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to such Bank to (ii) the aggregate
purchase price paid to all Banks) of such recovery together with an amount equal
to such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such other Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Account Party
agrees that any Bank so purchasing an interest or participating interest from
another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.09 may, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with
respect to such interest or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully
as if such Bank were the direct creditor of such Account Party in the amount of
such interest or participating interest, as the case may be.

     SECTION 2.10 Use of Letters of Credit. The Letters of Credit shall be used
                  ------------------------
for the general corporate purposes of the Account Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 2.11 Defaulting Banks.
                  ----------------

     (a) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Bank shall be a Defaulting
Bank, (ii) such Defaulting Bank shall owe a Defaulted Amount to any Agent or any
of the other Banks and (iii) any Account Party shall make any payment hereunder
or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Defaulting Bank, then the


                                       28

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such other Banks and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply at such time the amount
so paid by such Account Party to or for the account of such Defaulting Bank to
the payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to pay such
Defaulted Amount. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall so apply any
such amount to the payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount
so applied by the Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents payment, to such extent, of such
Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount so applied by the Administrative
Agent shall be retained by the Administrative Agent or distributed by the
Administrative Agent to such other Banks, ratably in accordance with the
respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the
Administrative Agent and such other Banks and, if the amount of such payment
made by such Account Party shall at such time be insufficient to pay all
Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the Administrative Agent, such other
Agents and such other Banks, in the following order of priority:

       (i)    first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then owing to the
   Agents;

       (ii)   second, to the Issuing Bank for any amount then due and payable to
   it, in its capacity as such, by such Defaulting Bank, ratably in accordance
   with such amounts then due and payable to the Issuing Bank; and

       (iii)  third, to any other Banks for any Defaulted Amounts then owing to
   such other Banks, ratably in accordance with such respective Defaulted
   Amounts then owing to such other Banks.

Any portion of such amount paid by such Account Party for the account of such
Defaulting Bank remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) of this Section 2.11.

   (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Bank shall be a Defaulting
Bank, (ii) such Defaulting Bank shall not owe a Defaulted Amount and (iii) any
Account Party, any Agent or other Bank shall be required to pay or distribute
any amount hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of
such Defaulting Bank, then such Account Party or such Agent or such other Bank
shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the
Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in
escrow and the Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held
by the Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection (b) shall be
deposited by the Administrative Agent in an account with First Union in the name
and under the control of the Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions
of this subsection (b). The terms applicable to such account, including the rate
of interest payable with respect to the credit balance of such account from time
to time, shall be First Union's standard terms applicable to escrow accounts
maintained with it. Any interest credited to such account from time to time
shall be held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by the
Administrative Agent from time to time in accordance with the provisions of,
this subsection (b). The Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time
to the extent necessary to make any Advances required to be


                                       29

<PAGE>

made by such Defaulting Bank and to pay any amount payable by such
Defaulting Bank hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank, as and when such Advances or amounts are
required to be made or paid and, if the amount so held in escrow shall at any
time be insufficient to make and pay all such Advances and amounts required to
be made or paid at such time, in the following order of priority:

       (i)    first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable by such
   Defaulting Bank to the Agents hereunder;

       (ii)   second, to the Issuing Bank for any amount then due and payable
   to it, in its capacity as such, by such Defaulting Bank, ratably in
   accordance with such amounts then due and payable to such Issuing Bank; and

       (iii)  third, to any other Banks for any amount then due and payable by
   such Defaulting Bank to such other Banks hereunder, ratably in accordance
   with such respective amounts then due and payable to such other Banks.

In the event that any Bank that is a Defaulting Bank shall, at any time, cease
to be a Defaulting Bank, any funds held by the Administrative Agent in escrow at
such time with respect to such Bank shall be distributed by the Administrative
Agent to such Bank and applied by such Bank to the Obligations owing to such
Bank at such time under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in
accordance with the respective amounts of such Obligations outstanding at such
time.

    (c)  The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Bank under this Section
2.11 are in addition to other rights and remedies that any Agent or any Bank may
have against such Defaulting Bank with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

    SECTION 2.12 Replacement of Affected Bank. At any time any Bank is an
                 ----------------------------
Affected Bank, the Account Parties may replace such Affected Bank as a party to
this Agreement with one or more other Banks and/or Eligible Assignees, and upon
notice from the Account Parties such Affected Bank shall assign pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance, and without recourse or warranty, its LC Commitment
Amount, its Letter of Credit Advances, its obligations to fund Letter of Credit
payments, its participation in, and its rights and obligations with respect to,
Letters of Credit, and all of its other rights and obligations hereunder to such
other Banks and/or Eligible Assignees for a purchase price equal to the sum of
the principal amount of the Letter of Credit Advances so assigned, all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, such Affected Bank's ratable share of all accrued
and unpaid fees payable pursuant to Section 2.05 and all other Obligations owed
to such Affected Bank hereunder.

    SECTION 2.13 Certain Provisions Relating to the Issuing Bank and Letters
                 -----------------------------------------------------------
of Credit.
----------

    (a)  Letter of Credit Agreements. The representations, warranties and
         ---------------------------
covenants by the Account Parties under, and the rights and remedies of the
Issuing Bank under, any Letter of Credit Agreement relating to any Letter of
Credit are in addition to, and not in limitation or derogation of,
representations, warranties and covenants by the Account Parties under, and
rights and remedies of the Issuing Bank and the Banks under, this Agreement and
applicable law. Each Account Party acknowledges and agrees that all rights of
the Issuing Bank under any Letter of


                                       30

<PAGE>

Credit Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each Bank to the extent of
its Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitment and Letter of Credit
Advances as fully as if such Bank was a party to such Letter of Credit
Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement
and any Letter of Credit Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail.

     (b) Certain Provisions. The Issuing Bank shall have no duties or
         ------------------
responsibilities to any Agent or any Bank except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement, and no implied duties or responsibilities on the part of the
Issuing Bank shall be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist. The
duties and responsibilities of the Issuing Bank to the Banks and the Agents
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature, and the Issuing Bank shall not have a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Agent, any Bank or any other Person. The Issuing
Bank shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under
or in connection with this Agreement or any Loan Document or Letter of Credit,
except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Issuing Bank, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to ascertain, inquire or give
any notice to any Agent or any Bank relating to (i) the performance or
observance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document on the part of any Account Party, (ii) the business, operations,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Account Parties or any
other Person, or (iii) the existence of any Default. The Issuing Bank shall not
be under any obligation, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide
any Agent or any Bank with any notices, reports or information of any nature,
whether in its possession presently or hereafter, except for such notices,
reports and other information expressly required by this Agreement to be so
furnished. The Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the execution,
delivery, effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity or adequacy of
this Agreement or any Loan Document.

     (c) Administration. The Issuing Bank may rely upon any notice or other
         --------------
communication of any nature (written, electronic or oral, including but not
limited to telephone conversations and transmissions through the Issuing Bank's
remote access system, whether or not such notice or other communication is made
in a manner permitted or required by this Agreement or any other Loan Document)
purportedly made by or on behalf of the proper party or parties, and the Issuing
Bank shall not have any duty to verify the identity or authority of any Person
giving such notice or other communication. The Issuing Bank may consult with
legal counsel (including, without limitation, in-house counsel for the Issuing
Bank or in-house or other counsel for the Account Parties), independent public
accountants and any other experts selected by it from time to time, and the
Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts. Whenever the Issuing Bank shall deem it necessary or desirable that a
matter be proved or established with respect to any Account Party, any Agent or
any Bank, such matter may be established by a certificate of such Account Party,
such Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, and the Issuing Bank may
conclusively rely upon such certificate. The Issuing Bank shall not be deemed to
have any knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default unless the Issuing
Bank has received notice from a Bank, an Agent or an Account Party referring to
this Agreement, describing such Default, and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default".

     (d) Indemnification of Issuing Bank by Banks. Each Bank hereby agrees to
         ----------------------------------------
reimburse and indemnify the Issuing Bank and each of its directors, officers,
employees and


                                       31

<PAGE>

agents (to the extent not reimbursed by the Account Parties and without
limitation of the obligations of the Account Parties to do so), in accordance
with its Pro Rata Share, from and against any and all amounts, losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature (including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (other than
in-house counsel) for the Issuing Bank or such other Person in connection with
any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or
threatened, whether or not the Issuing Bank or such other Person shall be
designated a party thereto) that may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Issuing Bank, in its capacity as such, or such other
Person, as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to or by reason
of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Letter of Credit, any
transaction from time to time contemplated hereby or thereby, or any transaction
financed in whole or in part or directly or indirectly with the proceeds of any
Letter of Credit, provided, that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such
                  --------
amounts, losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs or disbursements to the extent resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank or such other
Person, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (e) Issuing Bank in its Individual Capacity. With respect to its
         ---------------------------------------
commitments and the obligations owing to it, the Issuing Bank shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement and each other Loan Document as any
other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Issuing Bank, and
the term "Banks" and like terms shall include the Issuing Bank in its individual
capacity as such. The Issuing Bank and its affiliates may, without liability to
account to any Person, make loans to, accept deposits from, acquire debt or
equity interests in, act as trustee under indentures of, act as agent under
other credit facilities for, and engage in any other business with, any Account
Party and any stockholder, subsidiary or affiliate of any Account Party, as
though the Issuing Bank were not the Issuing Bank hereunder.

     SECTION 2.14 Downgrade Event with Respect to a Bank.
                  --------------------------------------

     (a) If a Downgrade Event shall occur with respect to (i) any Downgraded
Bank or (ii) any other Bank and, as a result thereof, such other Bank becomes a
Downgraded Bank, then the Issuing Bank may, by notice to such Downgraded Bank,
the Administrative Agent and the Parent within 45 days after such Downgrade
Event (any such notice, a "Downgrade Notice"), request that the Account Parties
                           ----------------
use reasonable efforts to replace such Bank as a party to this Agreement
pursuant to Section 2.12. If such Bank is not so replaced within 45 days after
receipt by the Account Parties of such Downgrade Notice, then (x) if no Default
                                                         ----
exists and such Downgraded Bank has not exercised its right to remain a Bank
hereunder pursuant to clause (y) below, the following shall occur concurrently:

               (A) the Committed Facility shall be reduced by the amount of the
          LC Commitment Amount of such Downgraded Bank,

               (B) the Account Parties shall prepay all amounts owed to such
          Downgraded Bank hereunder or in connection herewith

               (C) if, upon the reduction of the Committed Facility under clause
          (A) above and the payment under clause (B) above, the sum of the
          principal amount


                                       32

<PAGE>

          of all Advances plus the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit
          (valuing the Available Amount of, and Letter of Credit Advances of the
          Issuing Bank in respect of, any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit at the
          Dollar Equivalent thereof as of the time of such calculation) would
          exceed the amount of the Committed Facility, then the Account Parties
          will immediately eliminate such excess by paying Advances and/or
          causing the Available Amount of one or more Letters of Credit to be
          reduced, and

               (D) upon completion of the events described in clauses (A), (B)
          and (C) above, such Downgraded Bank shall cease to be a party to this
          Agreement;

or (y) if a Default exists or, not later than 30 days after receipt of such
Downgrade Notice, such Downgraded Bank notifies the Account Parties, the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent that such Downgraded Bank elects to provide
(in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank) cash collateral to the
Issuing Bank for (or if such Downgraded Bank is unable, without regulatory
approval, to provide cash collateral, a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory
to the Issuing Bank covering) its contingent obligations to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for any payment under any Letter of Credit as provided in Section
2.02(e) (its "LC Participation Obligations"), such Downgraded Bank shall be
              ----------------------------
obligated to (and each Bank agrees that in such circumstances it will) deliver
to the Issuing Bank (I) immediately, cash collateral (or, as aforesaid, a letter
of credit) in an amount equal to its LC Participation Obligations and (II) from
time to time thereafter (so long as it is a Downgraded Bank), cash collateral
(or, as aforesaid, a letter of credit) sufficient to cover any increase in its
LC Participation Obligations as a result of any proposed issuance of or increase
in a Letter of Credit. Any funds provided by a Downgraded Bank for such purpose
shall be maintained in a segregated deposit account in the name of the Issuing
Bank at the Issuing Bank's principal office in the United States (a "Downgrade
                                                                     ---------
Account"). The funds so deposited in any Downgrade Account (or any drawing under
------
such a letter of credit) shall be used only in accordance with the following
provisions of this Section 2.14.

         (b) If any Downgraded Bank shall be required to fund its participation
in a payment under a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.02(e), then the
Issuing Bank shall apply the funds deposited in the applicable Downgrade Account
by such Downgraded Bank (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) to fund
such participation. The deposit of funds in a Downgrade Account by any
Downgraded Bank (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) shall not
constitute a Letter of Credit Advance (and the Downgraded Bank shall not be
entitled to interest on such funds except as provided in clause (c) below)
unless and until (and then only to the extent that) such funds (or any drawing
under such a letter of credit) are used by the Issuing Bank to fund the
participation of such Downgraded Bank pursuant to the first sentence of this
clause (b).

         (c) Funds in a Downgrade Account shall be invested in such investments
as may be agreed between the Issuing Bank and the applicable Downgraded Bank,
and the income from such investments shall be distributed to such Downgraded
Bank from time to time (but not less often than monthly) as agreed between the
Issuing Bank and such Downgraded Bank. The Issuing Bank will (i) from time to
time, upon request by a Downgraded Bank, release to such Downgraded Bank any
amount on deposit in the applicable Downgrade Account in excess of the


                                       33

<PAGE>

LC Participation Obligations of such Downgraded Bank (or, if applicable, not
draw under any such letter of credit in excess of the L/C Participation
Obligations of such Downgraded Bank) and (ii) upon the earliest to occur of (A)
the effective date of any replacement of such Downgraded Bank as a party hereto
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, (B) the termination of such Downgraded
Bank's LC Commitment Amount pursuant to clause (a) or (C) the first Letter of
Credit Business Day after receipt by the Issuing Bank of evidence (reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank) that such Bank is no longer a Downgraded Bank,
release to such Bank all amounts on deposit in the applicable Downgrade Account
(or, if applicable, return such letter of credit to such Bank for cancellation).

         (d) At any time any Downgraded Bank is required to maintain cash
collateral with the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.14, the Issuing Bank
shall have no obligation to issue or increase any Letter of Credit unless such
Downgraded Bank has provided sufficient funds as cash collateral to the Issuing
Bank to cover all LC Participation Obligations of such Downgraded Bank
(including in respect of the Letter of Credit to be issued or increased).

         SECTION 2.15 Downgrade Event or Other Event with Respect to the Issuing
                      ----------------------------------------------------------
Bank. At any time that the Issuing Bank is a Downgraded Bank or at such other
----
times as the Issuing Bank and the Account Parties may agree, the Account Parties
may, upon not less than three Letter of Credit Business Days' notice to the
Issuing Bank (in this Section sometimes referred to as the "Old Issuing Bank")
                                                            ----------------
and the Administrative Agent, designate any Bank (so long as such Bank has
agreed to such designation) as an additional "Issuing Bank" hereunder (in this
Section sometimes referred to as the "New Issuing Bank"). Such notice shall
                                      ----------------
specify the date (which shall be a Letter of Credit Business Day) on which the
New Issuing Bank is to become an additional "Issuing Bank" hereunder. From and
after such date, all new Letters of Credit requested to be issued hereunder
shall be issued by the New Issuing Bank. From and after such date (and until the
first date on which no Letters of Credit issued by the Old Issuing Bank are
outstanding and no reimbursement obligations are owed to the Old Issuing Bank,
on which date the Old Issuing Bank shall cease to be an Issuing Bank hereunder),
references in this Agreement to the "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer (a)
to the Old Issuing Bank, with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it, (b) to
the New Issuing Bank, with respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued
by it, and (c) to each of the Old Issuing Bank and the New Issuing Bank, with
respect to other matters. Notwithstanding the fact that an Old Issuing Bank
shall cease to be an "Issuing Bank" hereunder, all of the exculpatory,
indemnification and similar provisions hereof in favor of the "Issuing Bank"
shall inure to such Old Issuing Bank's benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted by it while it was an "Issuing Bank" under this Agreement. The Account
Parties agree that after any appointment of a New Issuing Bank hereunder, the
Account Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to promptly replace (or
otherwise cause the applicable beneficiary to return to the Old Issuing Bank for
cancellation) each letter of credit issued by the Old Issuing Bank with a Letter
of Credit issued by the New Issuing Bank.

         SECTION 2.16 Non-Dollar Letters of Credit.
                      ----------------------------

         (a) The Account Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and
the Banks (i) agree that the Issuing Bank may (in its sole discretion) issue
Letters of Credit ("Non-Dollar Letters of Credit") in currencies other than U.S.
                    ----------------------------
dollars and (ii) further agree as set forth in the following paragraphs of this
Section with respect to such Non-Dollar Letters of Credit.


                                       34

<PAGE>

         (b) The Account Parties agree that their reimbursement obligations
under Section 2.03(a) and any resulting Letter of Credit Advance, in each case
in respect of a drawing under any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit, (i) shall be
payable in Dollars at the Dollar Equivalent of such obligation in the currency
in which such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit was issued (determined on the date of
payment), and (ii) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate plus 2%, for each day from and including the date on which the Applicable
Account Party is to reimburse the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to
but excluding the date such obligation is paid in full.

         (c) Each Bank agrees that its obligation to pay the Issuing Bank such
Bank's Pro Rata Share of the unreimbursed portion of any payment by the Issuing
Bank under Section 2.02(e) in respect of a drawing under any Non-Dollar Letter
of Credit shall be payable in Dollars at the Dollar Equivalent of such
obligation in the currency in which such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit was issued
(calculated on the date of payment), and any such amount which is not paid when
due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate plus,
                                                                        ----
beginning on the third Business Day after such amount was due, 2%.

         (d) For purposes of determining whether there is availability for the
Account Parties to request any Advance or to request the issuance or extension
of, or any increase in, any Letter of Credit, the Dollar Equivalent amount of
the Available Amount of each Non-Dollar Letter of Credit shall be calculated as
of the date such Advance is to be made or such Letter of Credit is to be issued,
extended or increased.

         (e) For purposes of determining the letter of credit fee under Section
2.05(c), the Dollar Equivalent amount of the Available Amount of any Non-Dollar
Letter of Credit shall be determined on each of (1) the date of an issuance,
extension or change in the Available Amount of such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit,
(2) the date of any payment by the Issuing Bank in respect of a drawing under
such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit, (3) the last Business Day of each March, June,
September and December and (4) each day on which the LC Commitment Amounts are
to be reduced pursuant to Section 2.04 (it being understood that no requested
reduction shall be permitted to the extent that, after making a calculation
pursuant to this clause (e), such reduction would be greater than the unused
portion of the LC Commitment Amounts).

         (f) If, on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, the sum of the principal amount of all Advances plus the Available
Amount of all Letters of Credit (valuing the Available Amount of, and Letter of
Credit Advances in respect of, any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit at the Dollar
Equivalent thereof as of such day) would exceed the amount of the Committed
Facility, then the Account Parties will immediately eliminate such excess by
paying Advances and/or causing the Available Amount of one or more Letters of
Credit to be reduced.

         (g) If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
necessary to convert a sum due in respect of any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit in
one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at
which in accordance with its normal banking procedures the Issuing Bank could
purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Letter of Credit
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of
any Account Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the Issuing Bank or
any Bank hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the
"Judgment Currency") other than that in
 -----------------

                                       35

which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Agreement and the applicable Non-Dollar Letter of Credit (the "Agreement
                                                                       ---------
Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that on the Letter of Credit
--------
Business Day following receipt by the Issuing Bank or such Bank of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Issuing Bank or such Bank
may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency
with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased
is less than the sum originally due to the Issuing Bank or such Bank in the
Agreement Currency, the Applicable Account Party agrees, as a separate
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Issuing Bank
or such Bank, as applicable, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Issuing Bank
or such Bank in such currency, the Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees to return
the amount of any excess to the Applicable Account Party (or to any other Person
who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

         (h) For purposes of this Section, "Dollar Equivalent" means, in
                                            -----------------

amount of U.S. dollars which could be purchased with such amount by the Issuing
Bank in accordance with its customary procedures (and giving effect to any
transaction costs) at the quoted foreign exchange spot rate of the Issuing Bank
at the time of determination; and "Overnight Rate" means, for any day, the rate
                                   --------------
of interest per annum at which overnight deposits in the applicable currency, in
an amount approximately equal to the amount with respect to which such rate is
being determined, would be offered for such day by the Issuing Bank to major
banks in the London or other applicable offshore interbank market. The Overnight
Rate for any day which is not a Letter of Credit Business Day (or on which
dealings are not carried on in the applicable offshore interbank market) shall
be the Overnight Rate for the immediately preceding Letter of Credit Business
Day.

         SECTION 2.17 Extensions of Expiration Date. The Parent may, at its
                      -----------------------------
option, give the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank written notice (an
"Extension Request") at any time not more than sixty days, nor less than thirty
 -----------------
days, prior to the Expiration Date in effect at such time (the "Current
                                                                -------
Expiration Date") of the Parent's desire to extend the Expiration Date to a date
---------------
which is not later than 364 days after the Current Expiration Date. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly inform the Banks of such Extension Request.
Each Bank which agrees to such Extension Request shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent its express written consent thereto no later than ten days
prior to the Current Expiration Date, and any failure of a Bank so to respond
shall be deemed to be such Bank's determination not to extend. No extension
shall become effective unless the express written consent thereto by the
Required Commitment Banks and the Issuing Bank is received by the Administrative
Agent on or before the tenth day prior to the Current Expiration Date. If the
Issuing Bank and the Required Commitment Banks, but not all Commitment Banks,
have expressly consented in writing to such Extension Request by such tenth day,
then the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Parent and the Parent may,
effective as of the Current Expiration Date, take one or both of the following
actions: (i) replace (as a party to, and for all purposes of, this Agreement)
any Commitment Bank which has not agreed to such Extension Request (a
"Nonextending Bank") with another commercial lending institution satisfactory to
 -----------------
the Issuing Bank (a "Replacement Bank") by giving notice of the name of such
                     ----------------
Replacement Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank not later than
five Business Days prior to the then Current Expiration Date and (ii) elect to
implement a Conversion to Tranche System as contemplated by Section 2.18 hereof
(or, if the Conversion to Tranche

                                       36

<PAGE>

System has previously been implemented, elect to implement a Supplement to
Tranche System as contemplated by Section 2.18 hereof). In the event that a
Nonextending Bank is to be replaced by a Replacement Bank, such Nonextending
Bank shall, upon payment to it of all amounts owing to it on the date of its
replacement, assign all of its interests hereunder to such Replacement Bank in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07(c) hereof. If the Issuing Bank
and the Required Commitment Banks shall have consented to such Extension
Request, then, on the Current Expiration Date, the Expiration Date shall be
deemed to have been extended to, and shall be, the date specified in such
Extension Request. The Administrative Agent shall promptly after any such
extension advise the Banks of any changes in the LC Commitment Amounts and the
Letter of Credit Participating Interest Percentages, as well as any changes
effected by the election of the Conversion to Tranche System or a Supplement to
Tranche System.

authority (including, without limitation, all governmental licenses, permits and
other approvals) to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except where the

likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding Equity
Interests in each Account Party (other than the Parent) have been validly
issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and (except for any Preferred
Securities issued after the date of this Agreement) are owned, directly or

a Material Adverse Effect.

party is required for (i) the due execution, delivery, recordation, filing or

exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Bank of its rights under the Loan

its terms.

         (f) There is no action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding
affecting any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, including any Environmental

enforceability of any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated by the Loan

         (g) The Consolidated balance sheets of the Parent and its Subsidiaries

and cash flows for the nine months then ended, to year-end audit adjustments,
the Consolidated financial condition of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as at
such dates and the Consolidated results of operations of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the periods ended on such dates, all in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis (subject,
in the case of the September 30, 2001 balance sheet and statements, to the
absence of footnotes). Since December 31, 2000, there has been no Material
Adverse Change.

         (h) The Parent has delivered to the Administrative Agent a true and
correct copy of each State Street Custodial Agreement as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement. Each State Street Custodial Agreement is in full force
and effect and no default or event of default by any Account Party exists
thereunder.

         (i) No written information, exhibit or report furnished by or on behalf
of any Loan Party to any Agent or any Bank in connection with the negotiation
and syndication of the Loan Documents or pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading as
at the date it was dated (or if not dated, so delivered).

         (j) Margin Stock will constitute less than 25% of the value of those
assets of any Account Party which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge
or other disposition hereunder. None of the Collateral constitutes or will

         (k) Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is an
"investment company", or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal
underwriter" for, an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the making of any Advances,
nor the issuance of any Letters of Credit, nor the application of the proceeds
or repayment thereof by any Account Party, nor the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, will violate any provision of
such Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder.

         (l) Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any lease or other agreement or
instrument or subject to any charter or corporate restriction that is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (m) Each Loan Party is, individually and together with its
Subsidiaries, Solvent.

         (n) Except to the extent that any and all events and conditions under
clauses (i) through (vi) below of this paragraph (n) in the aggregate are not
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

               (i)   Schedule B (Actuarial Information) to the most recent
          annual report (Form 5500 Series) for each Pension Plan, copies of
          which have been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, is complete
          and accurate and fairly presents the funding status of such Pension
          Plan, and since the date of such Schedule B there has been no material
          adverse change in such funding status.

               (ii)  Neither any Loan Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred
          or is reasonably expected to incur any Withdrawal Liability to any
          Multiemployer Plan.

               (iii) Neither any Loan Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has been
          notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such
          Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within
          the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, and no such Multiemployer Plan is
          reasonably expected to be in reorganization or to be terminated,
          within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA.

               (iv)  With respect to each scheme or arrangement mandated by a
          government other than the United States (a "Foreign Government Scheme
                                                      -------------------------
          or Arrangement") and with respect to each employee benefit plan that
          --------------
          is not subject to United States law maintained or contributed to by
          any Loan Party or with respect to which any Subsidiary of any Loan
          Party may have liability under applicable local law (a "Foreign
                                                                  -------
          Plan"):
          ----
                    (x) Any employer and employee contributions required by law
               or by the terms of any Foreign Government Scheme or Arrangement
               or any Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued,
               in accordance with normal accounting practices.

                    (y) The fair market value of the assets of each funded
               Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan
               funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
               Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
               sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit

                                       45

<PAGE>

               obligations, as of the date hereof, with respect to all current
               and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the
               actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
               account for such obligations in accordance with applicable
               generally accepted accounting principles.

                    (z) Each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been
               registered and has been maintained in good standing with
               applicable regulatory authorities.

               (v)  To the extent the assets of any Loan Party are or are deemed
          under applicable law to be "plan assets" within the meaning of
          Department of Labor Regulation (S) 2510.3-101, the execution, delivery
          and performance of the Loan Documents and the consummation of the
          transactions contemplated therein will not result in a non-exempt
          prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
          Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code.

               (vi) During the twelve-consecutive-month period to the date of
          the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the request
          for any Letter of Credit to be issued hereunder, no steps have been
          taken to terminate any Pension Plan, no contribution failure has
          occurred with respect to any Pension Plan sufficient to give rise to a
          lien under section 302(f) of ERISA and no minimum funding waiver has
          been applied for or is in effect with respect to any Pension Plan. No
          condition exists or event or transaction has occurred or is reasonably
          expected to occur with respect to any Pension Plan which could result
          in any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any material
          liability, fine or penalty.

         (o) In the ordinary course of its business, each Account Party reviews
the effect of Environmental Laws on the operations and properties of such
Account Party and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and
evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any
capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties
presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to
achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed
by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related
constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent
shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of
operations conducted thereat, and any actual or potential liabilities to third
parties and any related costs and expenses). On the basis of this review, each
Account Party has reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and
costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The operations and properties of each Loan
Party and each of its Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, except for
non-compliances which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; Hazardous Materials have not been
released, discharged or disposed of on any property currently or formerly owned
or operated by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and there are no Environmental
Actions pending or threatened against any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries, and no
circumstances exist that could be reasonably likely to form the basis of any
such Environmental Action, which (in either case), individually or in the
aggregate with all other such

                                       46

<PAGE>

pending or threatened actions and circumstances, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (p) Each Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries has filed, has caused
to be filed or has been included in all material federal tax returns and all
other material tax returns required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown
thereon to be due, together with applicable interest and penalties, except to
the extent contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings (in which case
adequate reserves have been established therefor in accordance with GAAP).

                                   ARTICLE V

                        COVENANTS OF THE ACCOUNT PARTIES

         SECTION 5.01 Affirmative Covenants. So long as any Advance or any other
                      ---------------------
Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any
Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or any Bank shall have any Letter of
Credit Participating Interest Commitment or commitment to issue a Letter of
Credit hereunder, each Account Party will:

         (a) Compliance with Laws, Etc. Comply, and cause each of its
             -------------------------
Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and orders, such compliance to include, without limitation,
compliance with Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits, ERISA and the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Chapter of the Organized Crime
Control Act of 1970.

         (b) Payment of Taxes, Etc. Pay and discharge, and cause each of its
             ---------------------
Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, before the same shall become delinquent, (i)
all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon
it or upon its property and (ii) all lawful material claims that, if unpaid,
might by law become a Lien upon its property; provided, however, that neither
                                              --------  -------
any Account Party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or
discharge any such tax, assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in
good faith and by proper proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves are
being maintained.

         (c) Maintenance of Insurance. Maintain, and cause each of its
             ------------------------
Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance with responsible and reputable insurance
companies or associations in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties
in the same general areas in which the Parent or such Subsidiary operates (it
being understood that the foregoing shall not apply to maintenance of
reinsurance or similar matters which shall be solely within the reasonable
business judgment of the Parent and its Subsidiaries).

         (d) Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc. Preserve and maintain,
             ----------------------------------------
and cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its existence,
legal structure, legal name, rights (charter and statutory), permits, licenses,
approvals, privileges and franchises; provided, however, that the Parent and its
                                      --------  -------
Subsidiaries may consummate any merger or consolidation permitted under Section
5.02(c) and provided further that neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
            -------- -------
shall be required to preserve any right, permit, license, approval, privilege or
franchise if the Board of Directors of the Parent or such Subsidiary shall
determine that the

                                       47

<PAGE>

preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business
of the Parent or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and that the loss thereof
is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Parent, such Subsidiary or
the Banks.

         (e) Visitation Rights. At any reasonable time and from time to time
             -----------------
upon prior notice, permit the Administrative Agent (upon request made by any
Agent or any Bank), or any agents or representatives thereof, at the expense (so
long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) of such Agent or such Bank,
as the case may be, to examine and make copies of and abstracts from the records
and books of account of, and visit the properties of, the Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Parent
and any of its Subsidiaries with any of their officers or directors and with, so
long as a representative of the Parent is present, their independent certified
public accountants.

         (f) Keeping of Books. Keep, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to keep,
             ----------------
proper books of record and account, in which full and correct entries shall be
made of all financial transactions and the assets and business of the Parent and
each such Subsidiary sufficient to permit the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP.

         (g) Maintenance of Properties, Etc. Maintain and preserve, and cause
             ------------------------------
each of its Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve, all of its properties that
are used or useful in the conduct of its business in good working order and
condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

         (h) Transactions with Affiliates. Conduct, and cause each of its
             ----------------------------
Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions otherwise permitted under the Loan
Documents with any of their Affiliates (other than any such transactions between
Loan Parties or wholly owned Subsidiaries of Loan Parties) on terms that are
fair and reasonable and no less favorable than it would obtain in a comparable
arm's-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

         (i) Pari Passu Ranking. Ensure that at all times the claims of the
             ------------------
Banks, the Issuing Bank and the Agents against it under the Loan Documents will
rank at least pari passu with the claims of all its other unsecured and
unsubordinated creditors, except for claims which are preferred by any
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws of general application
or are mandatorily preferred by law applying to insurance companies generally.

         (j) Additional Collateral. Comply with the provisions of this Section
             ---------------------
regarding any new or additional Collateral. The Account Parties may from time to
time add Collateral to the State Street Custodial Accounts without the necessity
of executing or delivering any documents pursuant to this Agreement (but subject
to the provisions of Section 5.02(g)). The Account Parties may from time to time
pledge new or additional Collateral contained in Custodial Accounts other than
the State Street Custodial Accounts by executing and delivering to the
Administrative Agent either a supplement to the Pledge and Security Agreement in
the form attached thereto (in the case of any new Custodial Account maintained
with State Street), or a new pledge and security agreement (in substantially the
form of the Pledge and Security Agreement) or other pledge agreement, security
agreement or charge (in the case of any new Custodial Account maintained with
another Custodian), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, and by causing to be executed and delivered to the
Administrative Agent a control agreement or such other Security Documents as the


                                       48

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall reasonably require together with such other
documents, certificates and opinions (including opinions as to the validity and
perfection of the Administrative Agent's Lien on such Collateral), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection therewith; and the
applicable Account Parties will take such other action as the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request to create in favor of the Administrative Agent a
perfected security interest in and Lien on the Collateral being pledged pursuant
to the documents described above.

     (k)  Custodial Account Statements. Cause to be delivered to the
          ----------------------------
Administrative Agent, promptly upon receipt after the end of each calendar
month, a monthly statement of each Custodial Account prepared by the Custodian
thereof, showing the assets credited to such account as of the date of such
statement.

     SECTION 5.02 Negative Covenants. So long as any Advance or any other
                  ------------------
Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any
Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or any Bank shall have any Letter of
Credit Participating Interest Commitment or commitment to issue a Letter of
Credit hereunder, each of the Account Parties will not, at any time:

     following such acquisition (other than any such Liens created in
     contemplation of such acquisition that do not secure the purchase price),
     or extensions, renewals or replacements of any of the foregoing for the
     same or a lesser amount; provided, however, that no such Lien shall extend

this subsection shall not occur unless any failure of any Account Party to
perform or observe any provision of this subsection shall remain unremedied for
30 days after the earlier of the date on which (y) a Responsible Officer becomes
aware of such failure or (z) written notice thereof shall have been given to
such Loan Party by any Agent or any Bank;

then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Banks, by notice to the Account
Parties, declare the obligation of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit
to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and/or (ii)
shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Required Banks, by notice
to the Account Parties, declare all amounts payable under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon all such amounts
shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived
by the Account Parties, and/or (iii) shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Required Banks, proceed to exercise the rights and remedies of
the Administrative Agent and the Banks under the Loan Documents and applicable
law, including, without limitation, by dating, delivering and acting upon
Letters of Instruction; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or
                        --------  -------
deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Account Party under the
Federal Bankruptcy Code, (x) the obligation of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters
of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (y) all such amounts shall
automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand,

protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Account Parties.

     SECTION 6.02 Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit upon Default. If
                  --------------------------------------------------------
any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative
Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Banks, after having taken any
of the actions described in Section 6.01(ii) or otherwise, make demand upon the
Account Parties to, and forthwith upon such demand the Account Parties will, pay
to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks in same day funds at the
Administrative Agent's office designated in such demand, an amount equal to the
aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding as cash
collateral. If at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default the
Administrative Agent determines that such funds are subject to any right or
claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Banks or that
the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of
all Letters of Credit, the Account Parties will, forthwith upon demand by the
Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional cash
collateral, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount
over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, that the Administrative Agent
determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of
any Letter of Credit, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank
or Banks, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                  THE GUARANTY

     SECTION 7.01 The Guaranty.
                  ------------

     (a) Subject to subsection (c) below, each Account Party hereby jointly and
severally, unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees the full and
punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of
all Obligations of each of the other Account Parties under the Loan Documents
including, without limitation, the principal of and interest on reimbursement
obligations owing by such other Account Parties pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to Letters of Credit. Upon failure by an Account Party to pay punctually
any such amount, each other Account Party agrees to pay forthwith on demand the
amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the limitations of subsection (c)
below as to the guarantee obligations of Tempest Life, all other Account Parties
at all times, including prior to the Tempest Life Effective Date, jointly and
severally, unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantee the full and
punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of
all Obligations of Tempest Life.

     (b) Each Account Party (other than the Parent), and by its acceptance of
this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent and each other Bank, hereby confirms
that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the
obligations of each Account Party hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer
or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance
Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or
state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the obligations of each
Account Party

                                       60

<PAGE>

(other than the Parent) hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention,
the Administrative Agent, the other Banks and the Account Parties hereby
irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Account Party (other than the
Parent) under this Article VII at any time shall be limited to the maximum
amount as will result in the obligations of such Account Party under this
Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
guarantee made by Tempest Life under this Article VII shall not be effective
until the date (the "Tempest Life Effective Date") on which Tempest Life
receives the necessary direction or exemption from the Bermuda Supervisor of
Insurance to the effect that any liability with respect to its guaranty provided
under this Article VII, until a claim or demand is made or funds are drawn
against, directly or indirectly, under this Article VII, need not be recorded as
a liability and thereby decrease its statutory capital and surplus as
determinable under the Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and the related
regulations. Upon the Tempest Life Effective Date, automatically and without
necessity of any acknowledgment or affirmation by Tempest Life or any further
action by any party, the guarantee made by Tempest Life under this Article VII
shall become effective and the obligations of Tempest Life under this Article
VII shall become Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the
date and occurrence of the Tempest Life Effective Date.

     SECTION 7.02 Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of each Account Party
                  ----------------------
under this Article VII shall be unconditional, absolute and irrevocable and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by:

          (i)   any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or

     release (including with respect to any Collateral) in respect of any
     obligation of any other obligor under any of the Loan Documents, by
     operation of law or otherwise;

          (ii)  any modification or amendment of or supplement to any of the

     Loan Documents;

          (iii) any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or
     indirect security for any obligation of any other obligor under any of the
     Loan Documents;

          (iv)  any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
     any obligor, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
     proceeding affecting any other obligor or its assets or any resulting
     release or discharge of any obligation of any other obligor contained in
     any of the Loan Documents;

          (v)   the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which any
     obligor may have at any time against any other obligor, the Administrative
     Agent, any Bank or any other corporation or person, whether in connection
     with any of the Loan Documents or any unrelated transactions, provided that
                                                                   --------
     nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate
     suit or compulsory counterclaim;

          (vi)  any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any
     other obligor for any reason of any of the Loan Documents, or any provision
     of applicable law or

                                       61

<PAGE>

     regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any other obligor of
     principal interest or any other amount payable under any of the Loan
     Documents; or

          (vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any
     obligor, the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any other corporation or
     person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the
     provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of
     or defense to an Account Party's obligations under this Article VII.

     SECTION 7.03 Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain
                  -------------------------------------------------------------
Circumstances. Each Account Party's obligations under this Article VII shall
-------------
remain in full force and effect until the commitments of the Banks hereunder
shall have terminated, no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding and all amounts
payable by the other Account Parties under the Loan Documents shall have been
paid in full. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any
reimbursement obligation or any other amount payable by an Account Party under
the Loan Documents is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Account Party or otherwise,
each other Account Party's obligations under this Article VII with respect to
such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not
made at such time.

     SECTION 7.04 Waiver by the Account Parties. Each Account Party irrevocably
                  -----------------------------
waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not
provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be
taken by any corporation or person against any other obligor or any other
corporation or person.

     SECTION 7.05 Subrogation. Each Account Party hereby unconditionally and
                  -----------
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter
acquire against any other Account Party, any other Loan Party or any other
insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of such Account Party's obligations under or in respect of this
Guaranty or any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any
right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Bank against any other
Account Party, any other Loan Party or any other insider guarantor or any
collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from any other Account Party, any other Loan Party or any other
insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by
set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim,
remedy or right, unless and until all amounts payable under this Guaranty shall
have been paid in full in cash, no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding and
the commitments of the Banks hereunder shall have expired or been terminated. If
any amount shall be paid to any Account Party in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in
cash of all amounts payable under this Guaranty, and (b) the Expiration Date,
such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Banks,
shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Account Party and
shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be
credited and applied to all amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured
or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, or to be held
as collateral for any amounts payable under this

                                       62

<PAGE>

Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) any Account Party shall make payment to any
Bank of all or any amounts payable under this Guaranty, (ii) all amounts payable
under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, and (iii) the final
Expiration Date shall have occurred, the Banks will, at such Account Party's
request and expense, execute and deliver to such Account Party appropriate
documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to
evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Account Party of an interest in the
obligations resulting from such payment made by such Account Party pursuant to
this Guaranty.

     SECTION 7.06 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment
                  --------------------
of any amount payable by any Account Party under any of the Loan Documents is
stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Account Party,
all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this
Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the other Account Parties under this
Article VII forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request
of the requisite proportion of the Banks.

     SECTION 7.07 Continuing Guaranty; Assignments. This Guaranty is a
                  --------------------------------
continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the
latest of (i) the payment in full in cash of all amounts payable under this
Guaranty and (ii) the final Expiration Date, (b) be binding upon each Account
Party, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Banks and their successors, transferees and assigns. Without
limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, any
Bank may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any
portion of its Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitment and the
Advances owing to it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon
become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Bank
herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in Section 9.07.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   THE AGENTS

     SECTION 8.01 Authorization and Action. Each Bank (in its capacity as a
                  ------------------------
Bank) hereby appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, no
Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall
be required to act (in the case of the Administrative Agent) or to refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting)
upon the instructions of the Required Banks or all the Banks where unanimity is
required, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Banks; provided,
                                                                 --------
however, that no Agent shall be required to take any action that exposes such
-------
Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable
law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Bank prompt notice of each
notice given to it by any Account Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

                                       63

<PAGE>

     SECTION 8.02 Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither any Agent nor any of its
                  ---------------------
respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with
the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each Agent:
(a) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Loan Party),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (b) makes no
warranty or representation to any Bank and shall not be responsible to any Bank
for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made
in or in connection with the Loan Documents; (c) shall not have any duty to
ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or to
inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (d)
shall not be responsible to any Bank for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; and (e) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate
or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram or telecopy) reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

     SECTION 8.03 First Union and Affiliates. With respect to its LC Commitment
                  --------------------------
Amounts, and the Advances, First Union shall have the same rights and powers
under the Loan Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though
it were not an Agent; and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include First Union in its individual capacity. First Union
and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage
in any kind of business with, any Loan Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person that may do business with or own securities of any Loan Party or any such
Subsidiary, all as if First Union were not an Agent and without any duty to
account therefor to the Banks.

     SECTION 8.04 Bank Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
                  --------------------
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank and based on
the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.05 Indemnification.
                  ---------------

     (a) Each Bank severally agrees to indemnify each Agent and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors and Affiliates (to the extent not
promptly reimbursed by the Account Parties) from and against such Bank's ratable
share (determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against such Agent or any such other Person in any way relating
to or arising out of the Loan

                                       64

<PAGE>

Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such
--------  -------
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Agent's or other Person's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Bank agrees to reimburse each Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel) payable by the Account Parties under Section 9.04, to the
extent that such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Account Parties.

     (b)  For purposes of this Section 8.05, the Banks' respective ratable
shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time, according to the sum of
(i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances outstanding at such time and
owing to the respective Banks, (ii) their respective Pro Rata Shares of the
aggregate Available Amounts of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time
and (iii) their respective Unused LC Commitment Amounts at such time. The
failure of any Bank to reimburse any Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any amount required to be paid by the Banks to such Agent as provided
herein shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to reimburse
such Agent for its ratable share of such amount, but no Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to reimburse such Agent for such
other Bank's ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of
any other agreement of any Bank hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each
Bank contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of
principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents.

     SECTION 8.06 Successor Administrative Agent. Any Agent may resign at any
                  ------------------------------
time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Parent and may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Banks. Upon any such
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the Required Banks shall
have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, subject (so long as
no Event of Default exists) to the consent of the Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Banks, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the Required Banks' removal of the retiring
Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of
the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial
bank organized under the laws of the United States or of any State thereof and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of
the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. If
within 45 days after written notice is given of the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal under this Section 8.06 no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted such
appointment, then on such 45th day (i) the retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation or removal shall become effective, (ii) the retiring Administrative
Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under the
Loan Documents and (iii) the Required Banks shall thereafter perform all duties
of the retiring Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents until such time,
if any, as the Required Banks appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided above. After any retiring Agent's

                                       65

<PAGE>

resignation or removal hereunder as Agent shall have become effective, the
provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. If
Fleet ceases to be a Bank hereunder, it shall be deemed to have resigned as
Documentation Agent and no replacement shall be appointed.

     SECTION 8.07 Collateral Matters.
                  ------------------

     (a)  The Administrative Agent is authorized on behalf of the Banks, without
the necessity of any further notice to or consent from any of the Banks, from
time to time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or Security
Document that may be necessary or as it may deem to be appropriate to perfect,
maintain and protect the security interests in and Liens on the Collateral
granted pursuant to the Security Documents.

     (b)  The Banks irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to release
any security interest in or Lien on the Collateral held by it pursuant to the
Security Documents (i) upon the termination of the Issuing Bank's obligation to
issue Letters of Credit hereunder, the payment in full of the Obligations and
the satisfaction and termination in full of all other Letter of Credit
Outstandings, (ii) that is sold or disposed of as permitted hereunder or any
other Loan Document or to which the requisite number or percentage of Banks have
consented or (iii) otherwise pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions
of any applicable Loan Document. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any
time, the Banks will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to
release Collateral pursuant to this subsection (b).

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 9.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
                  ---------------
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by any
Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Issuing Bank and the Required Banks (and, in the
case of an amendment, the Parent), and then any such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
       --------  -------
writing and signed by all of the Banks (other than (A) any Bank that is, at such
time, a Defaulting Bank, (B) in the case of clause (v) below, any Bank which is
not a Commitment Bank and which is not affected by such amendment, waiver or
consent and (C) in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (vi) and (vii) below, any
Bank which is not and will not be (and is not and will not be owed any
obligation which is or will be) affected thereby), do any of the following at
any time: (i) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01 or, in the
case of the Effective Date, Section 3.02, (ii) change the number of Banks or the
percentage of (x) the LC Commitment Amounts, (y) the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Advances or (z) the aggregate Available Amount of outstanding
Letters of Credit that, in each case, shall be required for the Banks or any of
them to take any action hereunder, (iii) reduce or limit the obligations of any
Account Party under Section 7.01 or release such Account Party or otherwise
limit such Account Party's liability with respect to the Obligations owing to
the Agents and the Banks, (iv) amend this Section 9.01, (v) increase the LC
Commitment Amounts of the Banks, extend the then

                                       66

(vi) reduce the principal of, or interest on, any reimbursement obligation or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, or increase any Bank's LC
Commitment Amount, (vii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
of, or interest on, any reimbursement obligation or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder, (viii) limit the liability of any Loan Party under any of the
Loan Documents, or (ix) release any of the Collateral if such release would
cause the aggregate Collateral Value to be less than the Letter of Credit
Outstandings; provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
              -------- -------
unless in writing and signed by an Agent in addition to the Banks required above
to take such action, affect the rights or duties of such Agent under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

     SECTION 9.02 Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications provided
                  ------------
for hereunder shall be in writing (including telegraphic or telecopy

delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart of any amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and

counterpart thereof.

     SECTION 9.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Bank or any
                  -------------------

or circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with respect to presenting
claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights generally and any
proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses of each
Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank in connection with the enforcement of the

misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to
which the indemnity in this Section 9.04(b) applies, such indemnity shall be

Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare amounts owing hereunder to be due and payable

or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Account Party
against any and all of the Obligations of such Account Party now or hereafter

Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
Obligations may be unmatured. Each Agent and each Bank agrees promptly to notify
each Account Party after any such set-off and application; provided, however,

set-off and application. The rights of each Agent and each Bank and their

remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such

and any other non-pro rata assignment approved by the Administrative Agent and
any Account Party, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that,
immediately prior to such assignment, was a Bank or an Affiliate of any Bank or

assignor's LC Commitment Amount, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an
Eligible Assignee, (iv) each assignment made as a result of a demand by any
Account Party pursuant to Section 2.12 shall be arranged by such Account Party
after consultation with the Administrative Agent and shall be either an

Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made
concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that
together cover all of the rights and

                                       69

obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by any Account
Party pursuant to Section 2.12 unless and until such Bank shall have received
one or more payments from either such Account Party or other Eligible Assignees
in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Advances made by such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon
to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to
such Bank under this Agreement, (vi) as a result of such assignment, no Account
Party shall be subject to additional amounts under Section 2.06 or 2.08, (vii)

Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and
Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $2,500.00.

     (b)  Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank, hereunder and (ii) the
Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.06, 2.08 and 9.04
to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such
assignment and any other rights that are expressly provided hereunder to
survive) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of an
assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall
cease to be a party hereto).

     (c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, each Bank
assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties thereto and hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Bank makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Loan

sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security
interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, any
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;

as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such
assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
it as a Bank.

     (d)  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose (but only for this
purpose) as the agent of the Account Parties, shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Banks and the LC Commitment Amount of, and principal amount of
the Advances owing to, each Bank from time to time (the "Register"). The entries
in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error, and the Account Parties, the Agents and the Banks shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all

and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its LC Commitment Amount, its Letter of Credit Participating Interest
Commitment and the Advances owing to it; provided, however, that (i) such Bank's

Credit Participating Interest Commitment) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations, (iii) the Account Parties, the Agents and the other Banks
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with
such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) no participant
under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by
any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or
consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, reimbursement obligations
or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent
subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the reimbursement obligations or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation. Each Bank shall, as agent of the Account Parties solely for the
purposes of this Section, record in book entries maintained by such Bank, the

                                                --------
to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential
Information received by it from such Bank.

Bank against presentation of documents that do not strictly comply with the
terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any
reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other
circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter
of Credit, except that such Account Party shall have a claim against the Issuing
Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be liable to such Account Party, to the extent

misconduct or gross negligence as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction in determining whether documents presented
under any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii)
the Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents
that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.

proceeding in any such court.

Credit Participating Interest Commitment, LC Participation Obligations, Letter
of Credit Exposure, and Letter of Credit Advances, if any, and the Assignee
proposes to accept assignment of such rights and assume the corresponding
obligations from the Assignor on such terms.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall
          -----------
have the respective meanings set forth in the Reimbursement Agreement.

<PAGE>

     2.   Assignment. The Assignor hereby assigns and sells to the Assignee all
          ----------
of the rights of the Assignor under the Reimbursement Agreement and the other
Loan Documents to the extent of the Assigned Amount, and the Assignee hereby
accepts such assignment from the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of
the Assignor under the Reimbursement Agreement to the extent of the Assigned
Amount, including the outstanding Letter of Credit Participating Interest
Commitment and Letter of Credit Exposure, and the amount of the Letter of Credit
Advances, if any, outstanding at the date hereof. Upon the execution and
delivery hereof by the Assignor, the Assignee[, the Administrative Agent and the
Parent] and the payment of the amounts specified in Section 3 required to be
paid on the date hereof (i) the Assignee shall, as of the date hereof, succeed
to the rights and be obligated to perform the obligations of a Bank under the
Reimbursement Agreement with an LC Commitment Amount (in addition to any LC
Commitment Amount theretofore held by it) equal to the Assigned Amount, and (ii)
the LC Commitment Amount of the Assignor shall, as of the date hereof, be
reduced by a like amount and the Assignor shall be released from its obligations
under the Reimbursement Agreement to the extent such obligations have been
assumed by the Assignee. The assignment provided for herein shall be without
recourse to the Assignor.

     3.   Payments. As consideration for the assignment and sale contemplated in
          --------
Section 2 hereof, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the date hereof the
amount heretofore agreed between them./1/ It is understood that commitment and
Letter of Credit fees accrued to the date hereof in respect of the Assigned
Amount are for the account of the Assignor and such fees accruing from and
including the date hereof are for the account of the Assignee. Each of the
Assignor and the Assignee hereby agrees that if it receives any amount under the
Reimbursement Agreement which is for the account of the other party hereto, it
shall receive the same for the account of such other party to the extent of such
other party's interest therein and shall promptly pay the same to such other
party.

     4.   [Consent of the Administrative Agent and the Parent. Pursuant to
          ---------------------------------------------------
Section 9.07(a) of the Reimbursement Agreement, this Agreement is conditioned
upon the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Parent. The execution of this Agreement by the
Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the Parent is evidence of this
consent.]

     5.   Non-Reliance on Assignor. The Assignor makes no representation or
          ------------------------
warranty in connection with, and shall have no responsibility with respect to,
the solvency, financial condition or statements of the Account Parties or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or the validity and enforceability of the
obligations of the Account Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
respect of any Loan Document. The Assignee acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance on the Assignor, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and will continue to be responsible for
making its own independent appraisal of the business, affairs and financial
condition of the Account Parties and their respective Subsidiaries.

___________________________
/1/ Amount should combine the principal amount of any Letter of Credit Advances
made by the Assignor together with accrued interest and breakage compensation,
if any, to be paid by the Assignee, net of any portion of any upfront fee to be
paid by the Assignor to the Assignee. It may be preferable in an appropriate
case to specify these amounts generically or by formula rather than as a fixed
sum.
