respect to such Aircraft, execute and deliver, as Owner Participant, each of the
Leveraged  Documents  to which  Owner  Participant  is to be  party as  provided
therein.


                  The  parties  agree  that  the  Leveraged  Documents  for each
  Leveraged  Aircraft  shall be in the form set forth in  Exhibit  C,  except as
  modified only to  incorporate  (a) the Delivery Date (and other dates measured
  with reference thereto),  serial numbers and registration number applicable to
  such Aircraft;  (b) the actual Lessor's Cost, as determined in accordance with
  Section 5 below;  (c) the Actual  Pricing,  as determined  in accordance  with
  Section 6 below;  (d) changes to reflect the terms of the Debt  Financing,  to
  the extent  agreed by the parties,  as  contemplated  in Section 7 below;  (e)
  changes,  if requested by GECC, to effect a like kind exchange as described in
  Exhibit E; and (f) the actual  Payment  Dates  (which will  correspond  to the
  interest payment dates under the Debt Financing).

4. SIL  Documents.  Attached as Exhibit D are the forms of agreements  and other
documents (collectively,  the "SIL Documents") which the parties have negotiated
and agreed to utilize to effect each of the SIL Transactions.  Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement  without  definition in relation to the SIL  Transactions
shall have the meanings set forth in the SIL Documents. Subject to the terms and
conditions  of this  Agreement,  ATA agrees that, on the Tender Date of each SIL
Aircraft, it shall (a) execute,  deliver and perform, as Lessee, each of the SIL
Documents to which  Lessee is to be a party as provided  therein and (b) procure
that the party  identified  therein as Owner  Trustee  (or  another  institution
reasonably  acceptable to GECC) execute and deliver the applicable SIL Documents
in such capacity.  GECC agrees that, on the Tender Date of each SIL Aircraft, it
shall  (or  shall  cause a  Permitted  Institution  to),  with  respect  to such
Aircraft,  execute,  deliver and perform, as Owner Participant,  each of the SIL
Documents to which Owner Participant is to be a party as provided therein.


                  The parties agree that the SIL Documents for each SIL Aircraft
shall  be in the form set  forth  in  Exhibit  D,  except  as  modified  only to
incorporate  (a) the  Delivery  Date (and other dates  measured  with  reference
thereto),  serial numbers and registration  number  applicable to such Aircraft;
(b) the actual  Lessor's Cost, as determined in accordance with Section 5 below;
(c) the Actual Pricing,  as determined in accordance  with Section 6 below;  (d)
changes,  if requested by GECC,  to effect a like kind  exchange as described in
Exhibit E; and (e) the actual Payment  Dates;  provided that with respect to the
Aircraft  identified  on  Exhibit  B as "GE  Purchase  Contract"  aircraft,  the
additional changes described in Exhibit F shall be made.

5. Lessor's Cost. In the Pricing Assumptions,  Lessor's Cost has been assumed to
be (Confidential  Material  Omitted) for each Aircraft to be delivered under the
ATA Purchase Contract and  (Confidential  Material Omitted) for each Aircraft to
be delivered  under the GE Purchase  Contract.  Lessor's  Cost for each Aircraft
shall be  adjusted  to be equal to the sum of (a) the actual  purchase  price of
such  Aircraft  under the  applicable  Purchase  Contract  (including  any price
escalation provided for therein) and (b) capitalized interest.

6. Pricing. (a) The Basic Rent payments and allocations, Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination  Values  and  EBO  Price  (collectively,  the  "Pricing")  for  each
Aircraft,  based on the pricing assumptions set forth in Exhibit G (the "Pricing
Assumptions"),  are set  forth in  Exhibit  H (the  "Assumed  Pricing")  for the
Leveraged  Aircraft  and the  SIL  Aircraft  respectively.  The  actual  Pricing
("Actual  Pricing") for each Aircraft  will be the Assumed  Pricing  adjusted as
provided in the following provisions of this Section 6.


                    (b) The Net  Economic  Return  shall be adjusted by changing
the net after-tax book yield component thereof to reflect any difference between
(1)  (Confidential  Material  Omitted) as quoted on the  (Confidential  Material
Omitted)  page (ask side  based on a 30/360  day  convention)  as of the  second
Business Day prior to the Delivery Date and (2) (Confidential Material Omitted).


                    (c) The Assumed  Pricing shall be  recalculated  (upwards or
downwards)  as of the  Delivery  Date by GECC,  in order to (i) maintain the Net
Economic  Return  (adjusted  as  provided  in Secton 6(b) above) and (ii) to the
extent possible consistent with clause (i), to minimize the Net Present Value of
Rents to Lessee, to reflect (A) any change in:

     (1) the Delivery  Date;  (2) the amount of Lessor's Cost; (3) the amount of
Transaction  Expenses;  or (4) in respect  of the  Leveraged  Transactions,  the
original  principal amount,  interest rate or amortization  schedule of the Debt
Financing from that set forth in the Pricing Assumptions; (Confidential Material
Omitted)and (C) any Change in Tax Law enacted, adopted, issued or (to the extent
described as a "proposed change" in the following definition of a "Change in Tax
Law") proposed on or prior to the Delivery  Date.  "Change in Tax Law" means (i)
any change, or any proposed change that has a proposed effective date that is on
or prior to the Delivery  Date,  in the Code  (provided  that,  in the case of a
proposed change in the Code, such change must have been "reported  favorably" by
the House Ways and Means  Committee  or the  Senate  Finance  Committee)  or the
Treasury  Regulations  (provided  that, in the case of a proposed  change in the
Treasury Regulations, such change must have been issued by the Department of the
Treasury)  or (ii) any  change  in the  interpretation  of the Code or  Treasury
Regulations in a decision by the United States Supreme Court,  the United States
Tax Court,  the United States Court of Claims or any of the United States Courts
of Appeal or  District  Courts,  or any  issuance of a revenue  ruling,  revenue
procedure or any pronouncement by the Internal Revenue Service or the Department
of the  Treasury  (other than a change in the  alternative  minimum tax or other
change that results in Owner  Participant's being subject to alternative minimum
tax or unable to use all tax benefits  because of its particular tax situation).
Subject to the following  paragraph,  in the event of any such proposed  change,
the parties  hereto shall  cooperate in order to determine the  methodology  for
taking into account in such recalculation the effect of such proposed change.


Any  such  recalculation  shall be  prepared  by GECC,  in  compliance  with the
provisions  of ss.  3.2.1(e)  of the Lease and  subject to  verification  in the
manner  provided  in  ss.  3.2.1(d)  of the  Lease,  on the  basis  of the  same
methodology  and assumptions  used by GECC in determining  the Assumed  Pricing,
except as such  assumptions have been modified to reflect the events giving rise
to such  recalculation and taking into account the law applicable at the time of
such recalculation (and, in respect of the EBO Price, subject to the constraints
set forth in ss. 3.2.1(b)(3) of the Lease). All recalculations (1) shall be made
so as to avoid  characterization  of the Lease as a  "disqualified  leaseback or
long-term agreement" within the meaning of Code ss. 467 and Treasury Regulations
thereunder and (2) shall be in compliance  with the  requirements of ss.4(1) and
ss. 4(6) of Revenue Procedure 75-21 and ss.ss.  4.02(5),  4.07(1) and 4.07(2) of
Revenue Procedure 75-28. In connection with any such  recalculations to payments
and allocations of Basic Rent,  appropriate  corresponding  adjustments shall be
made to the percentages set forth on the Schedules of Stipulated Loss Values and
Termination  Values in the  columns  headed  "Deferred  Basic Rent  Amount"  and
"Prepaid Basic Rent Amount."

     (d) In the  event  that  any  adjustment  to the  Pricing  for an  Aircraft
occasioned  by a Change In Tax Law  pursuant to clause (B) of Section 6(c) would
cause the Net  Present  Value of Rents (as defined in the  applicable  Lease) to
increase by more than (Confidential Material Omitted) in the case of an Aircraft
delivered under the GE Purchase  Contract or (Confidential  Material Omitted) in
the case of an  Aircraft  delivered  under the ATA  Purchase  Contract,  ATA may
terminate  this  Agreement  with respect to such  Aircraft by written  notice to
GECC, unless GECC, in its sole discretion, by written notice to ATA given within
four Business  Days after ATA gives such  termination  notice,  agrees to revise
such  adjustment  so that such present  value  increase  shall be  (Confidential
Material Omitted) or (Confidential Material Omitted),  respectively, or less. If
ATA  terminates  this  Agreement  with respect to any Aircraft  pursuant to this
Section 6(d), ATA shall not effect any lease or other financing of such Aircraft
that would reflect a Net Present Value of Rents (or the equivalent)  equal to or
greater  than the Net  Present  Value of Rents that  would  have  applied in the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement with respect to such Aircraft.

                  (e) In the event that any  recalculation  pursuant  to Section
6(c) results in a "back-ended  rent profile" for purposes of ss. 467 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, (i) the (Confidential Material Omitted)
requirement set forth in clause (A) of the definition of "Applicable Percentage"
shall apply to the first two Renewal  Terms,  and (ii) the provisions of Section
17 of the Lease shall be modified accordingly.

     (Confidentail Material Omitted)



8. Dates.  ATA shall give to GECC not less than five Business Days' prior notice
of the  scheduled  Delivery  Date of each  Aircraft,  provided that ATA shall be
entitled  to postpone  the  scheduled  Delivery  Date for an Aircraft by written
notice  to GECC  given  at any  time  prior  to 2:00 PM (New  York  time) on the
scheduled  Delivery  Date for such  Aircraft,  which  notice  may  specify a new
scheduled  Delivery  Date  on  a  subsequent   Business  Day.  If  notice  of  a
postponement does not specify a new scheduled Delivery Date, ATA shall give GECC
not less than two Business Days' notice of the new scheduled  Delivery Date with
respect to such Aircraft.

9. Return of Funds. If the closing of a Transaction  with respect to an Aircraft
fails to occur on the  scheduled  Delivery  Date and GECC  shall have made funds
available for such closing, ATA shall cause such funds to be returned to GECC in
immediately  available  funds by 3:30  p.m.  (New York  time) on such  scheduled
Delivery Date, unless GECC shall have agreed otherwise in writing.

10. Expenses. If the applicable Transaction with respect to an Aircraft fails to
close for any reason prior to the  termination  of this  Agreement,  pursuant to
Section 12 below,  ATA will pay all fees and expenses  (including the reasonable
legal fees and  expenses of GECC's  counsel)  incurred in  connection  with such
Transaction;  provided  that if the  Transaction  fails to close by  reason of a
breach  by  GECC  of its  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or by  the  Owner
Participant  of  any of  its  obligations  under  the  applicable  Participation
Agreement,  GECC  shall  pay  all  reasonable  fees  and  expenses  incurred  in
connection  with such  Transaction  (including  the  reasonable  legal  fees and
expenses of ATA's  counsel)  but  excluding  in any event any fees and  expenses
related to the Debt Financing.

11.  Conditions.

 (a) The obligation of GECC to participate in the  Transactions
with respect to each Aircraft as contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject
to the fulfillment or the waiver by GECC, on or before the Delivery Date of such
Aircraft,  of the conditions set forth in ss. 5.1 (except subsections 5.1.15 and
5.1.16 thereof) of the applicable  Participation  Agreement with respect to such
Transaction and the further conditions that (Confidential Material Omitted) (ii)
the Delivery  Date for such  Aircraft  shall have occurred on or before the date
contemplated  by clause  (ii) of Section 12 hereof  and  (Confidential  Material
Omitted).


     (b) The obligations of ATA to participate in the  Transaction  with respect
to each Aircraft as  contemplated  by this Agreement shall be subject to (i) the

and (ii) with respect to the Leveraged  Transactions,  the agreement of GECC and

contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 12 hereof.

     12. Termination.  The obligations of ATA and GECC under this Agreement with
respect to any Aircraft shall  terminate and be of no further force or effect on
the earlier of (i) the consummation of the  Transactions  with respect to all of
the  Aircraft and (ii) the Outside Date (as defined  below)  applicable  to such
Aircraft,  provided that the obligations of ATA and GECC under Section 10 hereof
shall survive, and remain in full force and effect following, the termination of
this  Agreement.  For purposes of this Section 12, "Outside Date" means December
31, 2002 with respect to the Firm  Aircraft and the SIL  (Confidential  Material
Omitted) (such date, in each case, the "Expiry Date"),  provided that if a labor
strike or similar  event occurs at The Boeing  Company  prior to the  applicable
Expiry  Date and such  strike or event  causes  the date of  delivery  under the
Purchase Agreement in respect of any of the Aircraft to be delayed, the "Outside
Date"  shall be deemed to mean the  earlier  of (x) the date which  follows  the
applicable  Expiry  Date by the  number of days  that  such  strike or event has
continued  in effect and (y) the date which is six months  after the  applicable
Expiry Date.

     13. Related  Matters.  (a) Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement by

with  leveraged  lease  transaction  [ATA 1996 B]  covering  the Boeing  757-23N
aircraft having manufacturer's serial number 27974 and shall execute and deliver
an appropriate amendment to the Participation Agreement dated as of December 16,
1996 in such  transaction  releasing  ATA from the  provisions  of Section 8(ee)
thereof that require such letter of credit.

                  (Confidential Material Omitted)

     14. GE Purchase  Contract.  GECC confirms that the purchase  price for each

terms of the GE Purchase  Contract  without  ATA's  written  consent.  GECC also
agrees that it will agree to reasonable  change orders and  amendments to the GE

                      Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in any
              of the Operative Agreements,  upon notice to Lessee, each of Owner
              Trustee's  and  Owner  Participant's  rights  (but  not any of its
              obligations  other than the obligation to pay Owner  Participant's
              Commitment  for the Aircraft)  under this Agreement to acquire the
              Aircraft may be assigned to [the  Intermediary] in connection with

of the  conditions  precedent  set forth in ss. 5, and  simultaneously  with the

immediately  available  funds to Seller's  account set forth in Schedule 1 or as
otherwise directed by Seller;

directly or indirectly constitutes,  or may be deemed under the Code or ERISA or
any rulings,  regulations,  or court  decisions  thereunder to  constitute,  the
assets  of any Plan,  or (bb) the  transfer,  and  subsequent  holding,  of such
Equipment Note or interest shall not involve or give rise to a transaction  that
constitutes a prohibited transaction within the meaning of ERISA ss. 406 or CodE
ss. 4975(c)(1)  involving Lessee,  Owner  Participant,  a Pass-Through  Trustee,
Subordination  Agent, or the proposed  transferee (other than A transaction that

     7.6 OTHER AGREEMENTS

     7.6.1 OWNER TRUSTEE IS OWNER FOR ALL PURPOSES

     Lessee,  Owner Participant,  and Owner Trustee agree that for all purposes,
after the Closing,  Owner Trustee will be the owner of the Aircraft (except that
Owner  Participant will be the owner for income tax purposes) and Lessee will be
the lessee  thereof.  No transfer,  by operation of Law or  otherwise,  of Owner
Participant's  beneficial  interest in and to the Trust Estate shall  operate to
transfer legal title to any part of the Trust Estate to any transferee thereof.

     7.6.2 COMMENCEMENT OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS

     Lessee, each Participant,  each Note Holder,  FSB, Owner Trustee,  WTC, and
Mortgagee  agree for the benefit of each of the others that it will not commence
or join in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code to commence a case under ss.
303 of the Bankruptcy Code against the Trust Estate.  NothinG  contained  herein
shall be deemed  to  preclude  any  Participant,  any Note  Holder,  FSB,  Owner
Trustee, WTC, or Mortgagee from filing any claim against the Trust Estate in any
case commenced against the Trust Estate.

     7.6.3 CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY MATTERS

     If (a) all or any part of the Trust  Estate  becomes  the  property  of, or
Owner  Trustee  or  Owner   Participant   becomes,   a  debtor  subject  to  the
reorganization   provisions  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  (b)  pursuant  to  such
reorganization  provisions (including Bankruptcy Code ss. 1111(b)), FSB or OwneR
Participant is required, by reason of FSB's or Owner Participant's being held to
have recourse  liability to any Note Holder or Mortgagee  directly or indirectly
(other  than the  recourse  liability  of FSB or Owner  Participant  under  this
Agreement or the Mortgage or by separate agreement),  to make payment on account
of any amount payable as principal,  Make-Whole  Amount (if any),  interest,  or
other  amounts on the  Equipment  Notes,  and (c) any Note  Holder or  Mortgagee
actually  receives  any Excess  Amount (as defined  below)  which  reflects  any
payment by FSB or Owner  Participant on account of clause (b) of this paragraph,
then  such  Note  Holder  or  Mortgagee  shall  promptly  refund to FSB or Owner
Participant (whichever shall have made such payment) such Excess Amount.

     For purposes of this ss. 7.6.3,  "EXCESS  AMOUNT" means the amount by which
such payment  exceeds the amount that would have been  received by a NotE Holder
or Mortgagee if FSB or Owner  Participant had not become subject to the recourse
liability referred to in clause (b) of the preceding paragraph.  Nothing in this
ss. 7.6.3 shall prevent a Note Holder or Mortgagee  from  enforcing any personal
recourse  obligation  (and  retaining  the  proceeds  thereof)  oF FSB or  Owner
Participant under this Agreement (other than as referred to in clause (b) of the
preceding paragraph) or the Mortgage (including any exhibits or annexes thereto)
or from  retaining  any amount paid by Owner  Participant  under ss. 2.13 or ss.
4.03 of the Mortgage.

     7.6.4 QUIET ENJOYMENT; SALE BY OWNER TRUSTEE BINDING

     (a) Each of Owner  Participant,  each Pass-Through  Trustee,  Subordination
Agent, each Note Holder,  Owner Trustee, and Mortgagee agrees (as to itself) for
the benefit of Lessee that, unless a Lease Event of Default exists,  such Person
shall not interfere (and shall not permit any Affiliate or other Person claiming
by,  through,  or under it to interfere) with Lessee's rights in accordance with
the Lease to the quiet enjoyment, possession, and use of the Aircraft during the
Term.

     (b) Any assignment,  sale, transfer, or other conveyance of the Aircraft by
Owner  Trustee made  pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement or the Lease shall
bind Owner Participant,  and shall be effective to transfer or convey all right,
title,  and  interest  of Owner  Trustee  and  Owner  Participant  in and to the
Aircraft.  No purchaser or other  grantee shall be required to inquire as to the
authorization,  necessity,  expediency, or regularity of such assignment,  sale,
transfer, or conveyance,  or as to the application of any sale or other proceeds
with respect thereto by Owner Trustee, as regards Owner Participant.

     7.6.5 RELEASE OF LIEN OF MORTGAGE

     Each of Lessee, Lessor, and Mortgagee agrees that in each instance referred
to in the Lease in which a transfer  of any  property  is required to be made by
Lessor to Lessee or any other Person (other than  Mortgagee),  Mortgagee  shall,
upon request of Lessor and  compliance  with the  applicable  provisions  of the
Lease and the Mortgage (including payment of all amounts then due and payable to
each Liquidity Provider and the Policy Provider as Supplemental Rent),  promptly
execute (at Lessee's  cost and  expense)  such  instruments  as Lessor or Lessee
reasonably  requests to evidence the release of the Lien of the Mortgage on such
property.

     7.6.6 NON-RECOURSE

     Loan  Participant and Mortgagee agree that (a) obligations of Owner Trustee
under the  Mortgage or any other  Operative  Agreement  and with  respect to the
Equipment Notes shall be  non-recourse to Owner  Participant and to FSB, and (b)
they will look solely to the income and  proceeds  from the Trust Estate and the
Collateral to the extent  available for distribution to Note Holder or Mortgagee
as  provided in the  Mortgage,  and neither  Owner  Participant  nor FSB will be
personally  liable to Loan  Participant or Mortgagee for any amounts  payable by
Owner Trustee  under the Mortgage or any other  Operative  Agreement;  PROVIDED,
that the  foregoing  is not  intended  nor  shall it be  construed  to limit any
recourse liability of Owner Participant or FSB to the extent that such liability
is expressly set forth in this  Agreement or in any of the Operative  Agreements
or arises by reason of the breach of any  representation or warranty or covenant
given by such Person (in the case of FSB, in its individual capacity).

     7.6.7 OTHER DOCUMENTS; AMENDMENT

     (a) Each of Owner  Participant  and Owner  Trustee  hereby  agrees  for the
benefit  of  Lessee,  the  Loan  Participants,   and  Mortgagee  not  to  amend,
supplement, or otherwise modify any provision of the Trust Agreement in a manner
that could  adversely  affect such party,  without the prior written  consent of
such party.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  so long as the Lease has not been
terminated or expired,  each  Participant,  Mortgagee,  and Owner Trustee hereby
agree for the benefit of Lessee that,  without Lessee's  consent,  they will not
amend,  supplement,  or  otherwise  modify (1) ss. 3, ss. 9, or ss.  2.05 of the
Mortgage,  (2) any  provision of any  Operative  Agreement  that will affect the
stated principal amount of or premium or interest on the Equipment Notes, or (3)
any other  provision of the  Mortgage or Equipment  Notes in a manner that could
adversely  affect Lessee.  Mortgagee and Owner Trustee agree to furnish promptly
to Lessee copies of any supplement, amendment, waiver, or modification of any of
the Operative  Agreements to which Lessee is not a party.  Each Loan Participant
agrees  that it will not take any  action in respect  of the  Collateral  except
through  Mortgagee  pursuant  to  the  Mortgage  or as  otherwise  permitted  by
Mortgage.

     (b) Owner  Trustee  agrees to join with Lessee to the extent that action on
its part is  necessary  or  appropriate  (1) to cause the  following  to be duly
accomplished in accordance with applicable United States federal Law by the time
the Aircraft is delivered  under this Agreement and the Lease:  (aa) to apply to
register  the  Aircraft in Owner  Trustee's  name,  and (bb) all related  action
necessary  in order for  Lessee to have  temporary  or  permanent  authority  to
operate the  Aircraft  as  contemplated  by the Lease,  and (2)  forthwith  upon
delivery  of the  Aircraft  under this  Agreement  and the  Lease,  to cause all
necessary documents to be duly filed for recording in accordance with applicable
United States federal Law.

     7.6.8 CONSENTS

     Each of each Participant,  each Pass-Through Trustee,  Subordination Agent,
Owner Trustee, and Mortgagee covenants and agrees, for Lessee's benefit, that it
shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to any consent or approval requested
of it or of Owner  Trustee or Mortgagee  under the terms of any of the Operative
Agreements which by its terms is not to be unreasonably withheld.

     7.6.9 INSURANCE

     Each of Owner Participant, the Pass-Through Trustees,  Subordination Agent,
and Owner Trustee agrees not to obtain or maintain insurance for its own account
as permitted by ss. 11.2 of the Lease if such  insurance  would limit,  increase
the cost of,  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  coverage  of anY  insurance
required to be obtained or maintained  by Lessee  pursuant to ss. 11 and Annex D
of the Lease.

     7.6.10 EXTENT OF NOTE HOLDER'S INTEREST

     A Note Holder  shall not, as such,  have any further  interest in, or other
right  with  respect  to,  the Trust  Estate or the  Collateral  when and if the
principal and  Make-Whole  Amount (if any) of and interest on the Equipment Note
held by such Note Holder,  and all other sums, then due and payable to such Note
Holder under any Operative Agreement, have been paid in full.

     7.6.11 FOREIGN REGISTRATION

     (a) Each  Participant,  Owner  Trustee,  and  Mortgagee  hereby  agree  for
Lessee's  benefit  that,  subject  to ss.  7.1.2 of the Lease,  LesseE  shall be
entitled to register the Aircraft or cause the  Aircraft to be  registered  in a
country other than the United States, if:

     (1) such registration is made only after the Tax Attribute  Period,  unless
Lessee prepays on a lump-sum basis any liability that would be due under the Tax
Indemnity  Agreement as a result of such registration  based upon the assumption
that such  registration  would  continue  for the  remainder  of the term of the
Permitted Sublease described in clause (3) below;

     (2) no Special Default or Lease Event of Default exists at the time of such
registration;

     (3) such  proposed  change of  registration  is made in  connection  with a
Permitted  Sublease  to a  Permitted  Air  Carrier,  and  such  country  is such
Permitted Air Carrier's domicile;

     (4) such country is a country with which the United  States then  maintains
normal  diplomatic  relations  (or, if Taiwan,  the United States then maintains
diplomatic  relations at least as good as those in effect on the Delivery  Date,
PROVIDED  that Lessee may not effect such  registration  in Taiwan unless it has
obtained the prior written consent of Owner Participant, which Owner Participant
may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion); and

     (5) Owner Participant,  Owner Trustee,  and Mortgagee receive an opinion of
counsel  (subject to  customary  exceptions)  reasonably  satisfactory  to Owner
Participant (and, while the Policy is in effect, the Policy Provider), addressed
to each such party, to the effect that:

     (aa) such country  recognizes  Owner  Trustee's  ownership  interest in the
Aircraft;

     (bb) Lessee's obligations,  and Owner Trustee's rights and remedies,  under
the  Lease  are  valid,   binding,  and  enforceable  under  the  laws  of  such
jurisdiction;

     (cc)  after  giving  effect  to such  change  in  registration,  (x)  Owner
Trustee's title continues as a valid and protected interest, (y) the Lien of the
Mortgage on Owner Trustee's  right,  title,  and interest in and to the Aircraft
and the Lease  continue as a valid and  duly-perfected  first-priority  security
interest,  and (z) all filing,  recording,  or other action necessary to protect
those matters addressed in (x) and (y) above have been accomplished (or, if such
opinion  cannot be given at the time of such  proposed  change  in  registration
because such change in registration is not yet effective,  (1) the opinion shall
detail what  filing,  recording,  or other  action is  necessary,  and (2) Owner
Participant, Owner Trustee and Mortgagee shall receive a certificate from Lessee
that all possible preparations to accomplish such filing,  recording,  and other
action are done, and such filing,  recording, and other action are accomplished,
and  a  supplemental  opinion  to  that  effect  shall  be  delivered  to  Owner
Participant,  Owner Trustee and Mortgagee  promptly  after the effective date of
such change in registration;

     (dd)  it is not  necessary,  solely  as a  consequence  of such  change  in
registration  and without  giving effect to any other activity of Owner Trustee,
Owner Participant,  or Mortgagee (or any Affiliate thereof),  for Owner Trustee,
Owner Participant, or Mortgagee (respectively) to qualify to do business in such
jurisdiction  as a result of such  reregistration  or in order to  exercise  any
rights or remedies with respect to the Aircraft pursuant to the Lease;

     (ee) there is no tort  liability  of the owner or lessor of an aircraft not
in possession thereof under the laws of such jurisdiction (it being agreed that,
if  such  latter  opinion  cannot  be  given  in a form  satisfactory  to  Owner
Participant,  such opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably  satisfactory
to Owner Participant is provided to cover such risk); and

     (ff)  unless  Lessee  agrees  to  provide  insurance  covering  the risk of
requisition of use of the Aircraft by the government of such country (so long as
the Aircraft is  registered  under the laws of such  country),  the laws of such
country  require fair  compensation by the government of such country payable in
currency freely  convertible into Dollars and freely removable from such country
(without  license or permit,  unless Lessee before such proposed  reregistration
has  obtained  such  license or permit)  for the taking or  requisition  by such
government of such use.

     (b) In addition,  as a condition  precedent to any change in  registration,
Lessee  shall give to Owner  Participant  and  Mortgagee  assurances  reasonably
satisfactory to each of them:

     (1) that the provisions ofss. 11 of the Lease have been complied with after
giving effect to such change of registration;

     (2)  of  Lessee's  payment,  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  all  reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of Lessor, each Participant,  and Mortgagee in connection
with  such  change  of  registry,   including  (aa)  the  reasonable   fees  and
disbursements of counsel to Lessee,  Lessor,  and Mortgagee,  (bb) any filing or
recording  fees,  Taxes,  or similar  payments  incurred in connection  with the
change of  registration  of the Aircraft and the creation and  perfection of the
security interest therein in favor of Mortgagee for the benefit of Note Holders,
and  (cc) all  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with any  filings
necessary  to  continue  in the United  States the  perfection  of the  security
interest in the Aircraft and the Lease in favor of Mortgagee  for the benefit of
Note Holders; and

     (3) that the tax and other  indemnities in favor of each Person named as an
indemnitee  under  any other  Operative  Agreement  afford  to each such  Person
substantially the same protection as provided before such change of registration
(or Lessee agrees to provide,  or cause to be provided,  additional  indemnities
that,  together with such original  indemnities,  in the reasonable  judgment of
Owner Participant, Lessor, and Mortgagee, afford such protection).

     7.6.12 OTHER COMMERCIAL RELATIONS UNAFFECTED

     Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  any  Operative
Agreement:

     (a) except as set forth in the Purchase  Agreement  Assignment,  nothing in
the Operative  Agreements shall constitute or be deemed to be a waiver by Lessee
of any rights,  remedies, or claims it may have against Airframe Manufacturer or
Engine  Manufacturer  or any  subcontractor  or  supplier  of  either;  and  the
Operative  Agreements  do not and shall not be construed or deemed to create any
rights, waivers,  immunities,  or indemnities in favor of Airframe Manufacturer,
Engine Manufacturer,  or any subcontractor or supplier of either with respect to
any such rights, remedies, or claims of Lessee; and

     (b) neither  Airframe  Manufacturer,  by its  execution and delivery of the
Consent and Agreement, nor Engine Manufacturer, by its execution and delivery of
the Engine Manufacturer  Warranty Agreement,  shall be deemed to have waived any
rights,  remedies,  or claims which Airframe Manufacturer or Engine Manufacturer
(or any  subcontractor  or  supplier  of either)  has  against  Lessee;  and the
Operative  Agreements  do not and shall not be construed or deemed to create any
rights, waivers,  immunities,  or indemnities in favor of Lessee with respect to
any such  rights,  remedies,  or  claims  of  Airframe  Manufacturer  or  Engine
Manufacturer (or any subcontractor or supplier of either).

     7.6.13 INTEREST IN CERTAIN ENGINES

     Each  Participant,  Owner Trustee,  and Mortgagee agree, for the benefit of
each  lessor,  conditional  seller,  or secured  party of any airframe or engine
leased to, purchased by, or owned by Lessee or any Permitted  Sublessee  subject
to a lease,  conditional  sale,  or other  security  agreement  that it will not
acquire or claim, as against such lessor,  conditional seller, or secured party,
any right, title, or interest in any engine as the result of the installation of
such  engine on the  Airframe  at any time while such  engine is subject to such
lease, conditional sale, or other security agreement and owned by such lessor or
conditional  seller or subject to a security  interest in favor of such  secured
party.

     8. CONFIDENTIALITY

     Lessee, Owner Participant, Note Holders, Owner Trustee, and Mortgagee shall
keep  Annexes  B,  C,  and D and  Schedules  1, 2, 3,  and 4 to the  Lease,  the
Participation  Agreement,  the  Purchase  Agreement  Assignment,   and  the  Tax
Indemnity Agreement confidential,  and shall not disclose them, or cause them to

auditors,  or  any  stock  exchange,  (d)  with  respect  to  Lessee  and  Owner
Participant,  by mutual  agreement of such  parties,  (e) with respect to a Note
Holder or any Pass-Through Trustee, to a nationally-recognized rating agency for
the purpose of  obtaining a rating on the  Equipment  Notes or the  Pass-Through

result of any act (other than  reregistration  of the  Aircraft  pursuant to ss.
7.1.2  of thE  Lease)  of Owner  Participant  or Owner  Trustee  or any  related
Indemnitee of such Person (not taken at the request of Lessee);

4975(c)(1).

     With respect to the Pass-Through  Indemnitees,  Lessee's  obligations under
this ss. 9.1 shall be limited to the same extent that Lessee'S  obligations  are
limited in clause (5) of the  definition  of  Supplemental  Rent.  In  addition,

oF such Indemnitee, a director,  officer,  employee, or agent of such Indemnitee
or any such  Affiliate,  or a  successor  or  permitted  assignee  of any of the
foregoing;  PROVIDED,  that  Owner  Trustee  and FSB  shall  not be deemed to be
related  Indemnitees  of Owner  Participant  merely  because  of their  trust or
fiduciary relationships.

     9.1.3 SEPARATE AGREEMENT

     This  Agreement  constitutes  a  separate  agreement  with  respect to each
Indemnitee, and is enforceable directly by each such Indemnitee.

     9.1.4 NOTICE

     If an Indemnitee makes a claim for any Expense indemnifiable under this ss.
9.1,  such  Indemnitee  shall  give  prompt  written  notice  thereof tO Lessee.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  Indemnitee's  failure to notify Lessee as
provided in this ss. 9.1.4,  or in ss. 9.1.5,  shall not release Lessee fRom any
of its obligations to indemnify such Indemnitee hereunder,  except to the extent
that such  failure  results in an  additional  Expense to Lessee (in which event
Lessee  shall not be  responsible  for such  additional  expense) or  materially
impairs Lessee's ability to contest such claim.

     9.1.5 NOTICE OF PROCEEDINGS; DEFENSE OF CLAIMS; LIMITATIONS


     (a) If any action,  suit,  or  proceeding  for which Lessee is  responsible
under this ss. 9.1 is brought  against any  Indemnitee,  such  Indemnitee  shall
notify  Lessee of the  commencement  thereof,  and Lessee may,  at its  expense,
participate in and, to the extent that it so desires  (subject to the provisions
of the following paragraph),  assume and control its defense and, subject to ss.
9.1.5(c),  settle or compromise it. Unless OwneR  Participant  agrees in writing
otherwise, no settlement of any claim hereunder may require Owner Participant to
agree to any remedy  apart from the  payment  of money  damages  (for which such
payment of money damages Lessee will in any event indemnify the Indemnitees).

     (b) Lessee or its insurer(s) shall have the right, at its or their expense,
to investigate or, if Lessee or its insurer(s) agree not to dispute liability to
the Indemnitee giving notice of such action,  suit, or proceeding under this ss.
9.1.5 for indemnification  hereunder or under anY insurance policies pursuant to
which  coverage  is sought,  control  the  defense  of,  any  action,  suit,  or
proceeding, relating to any Expense for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this  ss.  9.1,  and each  Indemnitee  shall  cooperate  with  Lessee  or its
insurer(s) with respect thereto;  PROVIDED, thaT Lessee shall not be entitled to
control the defense of any such action,  suit,  or  proceeding,  or to settle or
compromise  any such  Expense,  (i) while any Special  Default or Lease Event of
Default  under ss. 14.1 of the Lease  exists,  or (ii) if such action,  suit, or
proceeding will involve a material risk of thE sale, forfeiture,  or loss of, or
the  creation of any Lien (other than a  Permitted  Lien) on the  Aircraft,  the
Trust  Estate,  or any part  thereof,  unless Lessee shall have posted a bond or
other security or collateral  satisfactory to Owner Participant and Mortgagee in
respect to such risk, or (iii) if such action,  suit, or proceeding could in the
good faith opinion of such Indemnitee  entail any risk of criminal  liability or
material  civil  liability  or present a conflict  of interest  making  separate
representation  necessary. In connection with any such Lessee-controlled action,
suit,  or  proceeding,  such  Indemnitee  shall  have the  right to  participate
therein, at its sole cost and expense,  with counsel reasonably  satisfactory to
Lessee,  provided  that  such  Indemnitee's   participation  does  not,  in  the
reasonable  opinion  of the  independent  counsel  appointed  by  Lessee  or its
insurers to conduct such proceedings, interfere with the defense of such case.

     (c) In no event  shall any  Indemnitee  enter  into a  settlement  or other
compromise  with respect to any Expense  without  Lessee's prior written consent
(which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  unless such Indemnitee
waives its right to be  indemnified  with respect to such Expense under this ss.
9.1.

     (d) To the extent that any Expense  indemnified by Lessee  hereunder may be
covered by insurance maintained by Lessee, at Lessee's expense,  each Indemnitee
agrees  to  cooperate  with the  insurers  in the  exercise  of their  rights to
investigate, defend, or compromise that Expense as may be required to retain the
benefits of the insurance for that Expense.

     (e) If an Indemnitee is not a party to this  Agreement,  Lessee may require
that  Indemnitee  to agree in  writing  to the terms of this ss. 9 and ss.  15.8
before making any payment to such Indemnitee under this ss. 9.

     (f)  Nothing  herein  shall be  deemed  to be an  assumption  by  Lessee of
obligations  of Owner  Trustee with respect to, or a guarantee by Lessee of, any
amounts  payable by Owner  Trustee  upon  Equipment  Notes or a guarantee of any
residual value of the Aircraft.

     (g) Nothing in this ss. 9.1.5 shall  require an  Indemnitee  to contest any
Expense or to assume  responsibility  for or control of any judicial  proceeding
with respect thereto.

     9.1.6 INFORMATION

     Lessee will  provide the  relevant  Indemnitee  with such  information  not
within the control of such  Indemnitee  (but in Lessee's  control or  reasonably
available  to  Lessee)  which  such  Indemnitee  reasonably  requests,  and will
otherwise  cooperate  with such  Indemnitee  so as to enable such  Indemnitee to
fulfill its  obligations  under ss. 9.1.5 and to control or  participate  in any
proceeding to the extent  permitted by ss. 9.1.5.  The  IndemniTee  shall supply
Lessee  with such  information  not  within the  control of Lessee  (but in such
Indemnitee's  control or reasonably  available to such Indemnitee)  which Lessee
reasonably  requests to control or  participate  in any proceeding to the extent
permitted by ss. 9.1.5.

     9.1.7 EFFECT OF OTHER INDEMNITIES; SUBROGATION; FURTHER ASSURANCES

     Upon  payment in full by or on behalf of Lessee of any  indemnity  provided
for under this  Agreement,  without  any  further  action and to the full extent
permitted by Law,  Lessee will be  subrogated  to all rights and remedies of the
Person  indemnified  (other  than  with  respect  to  any of  such  Indemnitee's
insurance  policies or in connection with any indemnity claim of such Indemnitee
under  ss.  5.03 or ss.  7 of the  Mortgage  or ss.  5.3 or ss.  7 of the  Trust
Agreement) in respect of the matter as to which such  indemnity  was paid.  Each
Indemnitee  will give such further  assurances or agreements  and cooperate with
Lessee to permit  Lessee to pursue any such  claims,  to the  extent  reasonably
requested by Lessee and at Lessee's expense.

     9.1.8 REFUNDS

     If an Indemnitee  receives any refund, in whole or in part, with respect to
any  Expense  paid by or on behalf of Lessee  hereunder,  that  Indemnitee  will
promptly  pay the  amount  refunded  (but not an amount in excess of the  amount
Lessee or any of its  insurers  has paid in  respect  of such  Expense)  over to
Lessee unless a Lease Event of Default  exists,  in which case such amount shall
be paid over to Owner Trustee (or, if the Mortgage has not been  discharged,  to
Mortgagee)  to hold as  security  for  Lessee's  obligations  under  the  Lessee
Operative  Agreements  or, if  requested  by Lessee,  applied  to satisfy  those
obligations. Any subsequent loss of such recovery or tax benefit or refund shall
be subject to the provisions of ss. 9.1 and ss. 9.3.

     9.2 EXPENSES

     9.2.1 INVOICES AND PAYMENT

     Each of Owner  Trustee,  Mortgagee,  Owner  Participant,  the  Pass-Through

reasonable  detail of the  Transaction  Expenses for which it is responsible for
providing  information  as they are  received  (and not later  than the 90th day
after the Delivery Date). If so submitted and approved, Owner Participant agrees
promptly  (and not later than the later of (i) the 105th day after the  Delivery

Transaction Expenses . Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lessee at its sole option
shall have the right to pay directly any and all Transaction Expenses payable to
Lessee  Advisor  or  Lessee's  counsel  or (if such  payment  does not result in
adverse tax  consequences to Owner  Participant)  to any other Person.  If Owner
Participant  fails to pay any  Transaction  Expense  that it is obligated to pay
hereunder, Lessee shall pay such Transaction Expense. Any such payment by Lessee
shall not affect Owner  Participant's  obligations  or Lessee's  rights  against
Owner Participant for its failure to make any such payment.

     9.2.2 PAYMENT OF OTHER EXPENSES

     Lessee  shall pay (a) the ongoing  fees and  expenses of Owner  Trustee and
Mortgagee,  and (b) all reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses (including

attributable  to (1)  any  transfer  of  title  to the  Aircraft  or any  Engine
contemplated  by  ss.  4.5 of  the  Lease,  or (2)  any  waiver,  amendment,  or
modification of any Operative Agreement to the extent requested by Lessee.

required by  applicable  law to make any such  withholding  or deduction for any
such payment, (a) Lessee shall make all such withholdings or deductions, (b) the

excluded  from  indemnification  pursuant to ss.  9.3.2,  Lessee  shall pay such
additional  amount (if any)  required  so that thE total  amount  paid by Lessee
(after making all required withholdings) is equal to (assuming timely payment of
the Equipment  Notes before the relevant  Payment Date) the aggregate  principal
amount of scheduled  installments due on the Equipment Notes  outstanding on the
relevant  Payment Date,  together with accrued and unpaid  interest,  due on the
Equipment  Notes; and Owner  Participant or Owner Trustee (as applicable)  shall

foregoing (whether or not indemnified against by any other Person), upon or with
respect to the  Operative  Agreements  and the  Pass-Through  Agreements,  their
execution,  or the transactions or payments contemplated thereby,  including any

more of the net present value of the payment as computed by such Tax Indemnitee,
in which case such Tax Indemnitee shall pay those costs.

     (c) Each Tax Indemnitee shall provide Lessee with such certifications,  and
such  information and  documentation  in such Tax  Indemnitee's  possession,  as
Lessee  reasonably  requests to minimize any indemnity  payment pursuant to this
ss. 9.3;  PROVIDED,  that  notwithstanding  anything to the contrarY in this ss.
9.3.3(c),  no Tax  Indemnitee  shall be required to provide  Lessee with any Tax
returns.

     (d) Each Tax  Indemnitee  shall  promptly  forward  to Lessee  any  written
notice,  bill,  or advice  that such Tax  Indemnitee  receives  from any  Taxing
Authority concerning any Tax for which it seeks  indemnification  under this ss.
9.3. Lessee shall pay any amount for which it is liable pursuant tO this ss. 9.3
directly to the appropriate  Taxing  Authority if legally  permissible,  or upon
demand of a Tax Indemnitee, to such Tax Indemnitee within 30 dayS of such demand
(or, if a contest  occurs in accordance  with ss. 9.3.4,  within 30 days after a
Final Determination (as defined below)),  but in no event morE than one Business
Day before the related Tax is due. If requested by a Tax  Indemnitee in writing,
Lessee  shall  furnish to the  appropriate  Tax  Indemnitee  the  original  or a
certified copy of a receipt for Lessee's  payment of any Tax paid by Lessee,  or
such  other  evidence  of  payment  of such  Tax as is  acceptable  to such  Tax
Indemnitee. Lessee shall also furnish promptly upon written request such data as
any Tax Indemnitee  reasonably  requires to enable such Tax Indemnitee to comply
with the  requirements  of any  taxing  jurisdiction,  unless  such data are not
reasonably  available to Lessee or (unless such data are specifically  requested
by a Taxing  Authority) are not  customarily  furnished by domestic air carriers
under   similar   circumstances.   For  purposes  of  this  ss.  9.3,  a  "FINAL
DETERMINATION" is (1) a decision,  judgment, decree, or other order by any court
of competent  jurisdiction  that occurs pursuant to thE provisions of ss. 9.3.4,
which  decision,   judgment,  decree,  or  other  order  has  become  final  and
unappealable,  (2) a closing  agreement or settlement  agreemenT entered into in
accordance  with ss. 9.3.4 that has become binding and is not subject to further
review or appeal (absent fraud, misrepresentation, etc.), oR (3) the termination
of  administrative  proceedings and the expiration of the time for instituting a
claim in a court proceeding.

     (e) If any Tax Indemnitee  actually realizes a tax savings by reason of any
Tax paid or  indemnified  by Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 (whether  such tax
savings  arise by means of a foreign tax credit,  depreciation  or cost recovery
deduction, or otherwise),  and such savings are not otherwise taken into account
in computing such payment or indemnity,  such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to Lessee
an amount  equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of such tax  savings,  plus any
additional net tax savings recognized as the result of any payment made pursuant
to this sentence,  when, as, if, and to the extent realized,  and (2) the amount
of all payments  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 by Lessee to such Tax Indemnitee (less
any payments  previously  made bY such Tax Indemnitee to Lessee pursuant to this
ss.  9.3.3(e))  (and the excess,  if any, of the amount  described in clause (1)
over the amount  described iN clause (2) shall be carried forward and applied to
reduce PRO TANTO any  subsequent  obligations of Lessee to make payments to such
Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3);  PROVIDED,  that such Tax Indemnitee
shall not be required to make any payment pursuant to this sentence so long as a
Special  Default or A Lease Event of Default of a monetary  nature exists.  If a
tax benefit is later  disallowed or denied,  the disallowance or denial shall be
treated as a Tax indemnifiable  under ss. 9.3.1 without regard to the provisions
of ss. 9.3.2 (other than ss.  9.3.2(f)).  Each such Tax Indemnitee shall in good
faitH use  reasonable  efforts in filing  its tax  returns  and in dealing  with
Taxing Authorities to seek and claim any such tax benefit.

     9.3.4 CONTEST

     (a) If a written  claim is made  against a Tax  Indemnitee  for Taxes  that
Lessee could be liable to pay or indemnify for hereunder, or if a Tax Indemnitee
determines that a Tax is due and that Lessee could have an indemnity  obligation
for that Tax  hereunder,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall  promptly  notify Lessee in
writing of such claim  (PROVIDED,  that  failure so to notify  Lessee  shall not
relieve  Lessee of its  indemnity  obligations  hereunder  unless the failure to
notify  effectively  forecloses  Lessee's  rights to  require a contest  of such
claim),  and shall take no action with  respect to such claim  without  Lessee's
prior written  consent for 30 days  following  Lessee's  receipt of such notice;
PROVIDED,  that, if applicable  Law requires such Tax  Indemnitee to take action
before the end of such 30-day period,  such Tax Indemnitee shall, in such notice
to Lessee, so inform Lessee, and such Tax Indemnitee shall take no action for as
long as it is legally able to avoid taking action (and a Tax Indemnitee shall be
entitled  to pay the Tax  claimed  and sue for a refund  before  the end of such
30-day period if (1)(aa) the failure to pay the Tax would result in  substantial
penalties  (unless  immediately  reimbursed by Lessee) and the act of paying the
Tax would not materially  prejudice the right to contest, or (bb) the failure to
pay would result in criminal  penalties,  and (2) such Tax Indemnitee shall take
any action so required in connection  with so paying the Tax in a manner that is
the least  prejudicial  to the pursuit of the  contest).  In addition,  such Tax
Indemnitee   shall  (provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  agreed  to  keep  such
information  confidential other than to the extent necessary in order to contest
the claim) furnish Lessee with copies of any requests for  information  from any
Taxing  Authority  relating  to such Taxes with  respect to which  Lessee may be
required to indemnify  hereunder.  If  requested by Lessee in writing  within 30
days after its receipt of such notice,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall,  at Lessee's
expense (including all reasonable costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' and
accountants' fees and disbursements), in good faith contest (or, if permitted by
applicable law, allow Lessee to contest) through appropriate  administrative and
judicial proceedings the validity, applicability, or amount of such Taxes by (x)
resisting  payment  thereof,  (y) not paying the Taxes except  under  protest if
protest is necessary and proper, or (z) if the payment is made, using reasonable
efforts to obtain a refund thereof in an appropriate  administrative or judicial
proceeding. If requested to do so by Lessee, the Tax Indemnitee shall appeal any
adverse  administrative  or judicial  decision,  except that the Tax  Indemnitee
shall not be required to pursue any appeals to the United States  Supreme Court.
If and to the extent that the Tax  Indemnitee  is able to separate the contested
issue(s)  from other  issues  arising  in the same  administrative  or  judicial
proceeding  that  are  unrelated  to  the  Transactions  without  (in  such  Tax
Indemnitee's good faith judgment) adversely affecting such Tax Indemnitee,  such
Tax Indemnitee shall permit Lessee to control the conduct of any such proceeding
and shall provide to Lessee (at Lessee's cost and expense) with such information
or data in such Tax Indemnitee's  control or possession and reasonably necessary
to conduct such contest  (other than such Tax  Indemnitee's  federal  income Tax
returns) in which case Lessee shall keep such Tax Indemnitee reasonably informed
concerning the progress of such contest. If the contest is being controlled by a
Tax  Indemnitee,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall  consult with Lessee in good faith
regarding the manner of contesting  such claim and shall keep Lessee  reasonably
informed regarding the progress of such contest. A Tax Indemnitee shall not fail
to take any action  expressly  required by this ss. 9.3.4  (including anY action
regarding any appeal of an adverse  determination  with respect to any claim) or
settle or compromise any claim without Lessee's prior written consent (except as
contemplated by ss. 9.3.4(b) or (c)).

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in no event shall a Tax Indemnitee be
required  to pursue any  contest  (or to permit  Lessee to pursue  any  contest)
unless  (1)  Lessee  agrees to pay to such Tax  Indemnitee  on demand  and on an
after-tax  basis all  reasonable  costs and  expenses  that such Tax  Indemnitee
incurs in  connection  with  contesting  such Taxes,  including  all  reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees
and disbursements, (2) if such contest involves the payment of the claim, Lessee
advances the amount thereof (to the extent indemnified hereunder) plus interest,
penalties,  and  additions to tax with  respect  thereto that are required to be
paid before  commencing the contest on an  interest-free  net after-Tax basis to
such Tax Indemnitee,  (3) such Tax Indemnitee does not reasonably determine that
the action to be taken will result in any material risk of forfeiture,  sale, or
loss of the Aircraft (unless Lessee makes provisions to protect the interests of
any  such  Tax  Indemnitee  in a  manner  reasonably  satisfactory  to such  Tax
Indemnitee)  (PROVIDED,  that such Tax Indemnitee shall notify Lessee in writing
promptly after it becomes aware of any such risk), (4) no Lease Event of Default
exists,  unless Lessee has provided  security for its  obligations  hereunder by
advancing to such Tax  Indemnitee,  before  proceeding or  continuing  with such
contest, the amount of the Tax being contested,  plus any interest and penalties
and an amount  estimated in good faith by such Tax Indemnitee for expenses,  (5)
before commencing any judicial action controlled by Lessee,  Lessee acknowledges
its liability for such claim hereunder in writing,  PROVIDED,  that Lessee shall
not be  bound  by its  acknowledgment  if the  Final  Determination  articulates
conclusions  of law and fact that  demonstrate  that Lessee has no liability for
the contested amounts hereunder,  (6) such Tax Indemnitee shall have received at
Lessee's sole expense,  an opinion  independent tax counsel,  such counsel to be
selected by Lessee and  reasonably  satisfactory  to such Tax  Indemnitee  ("Tax
Counsel"),  to the effect  that a  reasonable  basis,  within the meaning of ABA
Formal Opinion No. 85-352,  exists for contesting such claim,  (7) the amount of
payments  or  indemnification  that  would  be  required  as a  result  of  such
adjustment, when aggregated with further potential payments or adjustments where
the subject matter of the proposed  adjustment is of a continuing  nature, as to
the  Aircraft  and all other  aircraft  operated  by  Lessee,  shall be at least
$10,000,  and (8) the issue  shall not be  substantially  identical  as an issue
previously contested hereunder and decided adversely, unless such Tax Indemnitee
shall have received,  at Lessee's sole expense,  a written opinion,  in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee,  of Tax Counsel to the
effect  that  the  applicable  circumstances  or law have  changed  and in light
thereof,  there is reasonable basis under ABA Formal Opinion No. 85-352 that the
tax  treatment  of the item which is the  subject of the claim will be upheld in
litigation if the claimed tax  treatment is  challenged  by a Taxing  Authority.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,   if  any  Tax  Indemnitee  releases,   waives,
compromises,  or settles any claim that may be  indemnifiable by Lessee pursuant
to this ss. 9.3 and which such Tax Indemnitee is otherwise  obligated to contest
under this ss. 9.3.4 without Lessee's written permissiOn, Lessee's obligation to
indemnify   such  Tax   Indemnitee   with   respect   to  such  claim  (and  all
directly-related  claims,  and claims  based on the outcome of such claim) shall
terminate,  subject  to ss.  9.3.4(c),  and  subject to ss.  9.3.4(c),  such Tax
Indemnitee shall repay to Lessee any amount  previously paid or advanCed to such
Tax Indemnitee with respect to such claim,  plus interest at the rate that would
have been payable by the relevant Taxing Authority on a refund of such Tax.

     (c) Notwithstanding  anything in this ss. 9.3, a Tax Indemnitee will not be
required to contest the  imposition of any Tax, and shall bE permitted to settle
or compromise  any claim without  Lessee's  consent,  if such Tax Indemnitee (1)
waives its right to  indemnity  under this ss. 9.3 witH respect to such Tax (and
any  directly-related  claim,  and any claim the outcome of which is  determined
based upon the outcome of such claim),  (2) pays to Lessee any amount previously
paid or  advanced by Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 with  respect to such Tax,
plus  interest at the rate that would have beeN payable by the  relevant  Taxing
Authority  on a refund of such Tax,  and (3) agrees to discuss  with  Lessee the
views  or  positions  of any  relevant  Taxing  Authority  with  respect  to the
imposition of such Tax PROVIDED,  that if Lessee has agreed in writing to settle
a claim for a stated amount and the relevant Tax Indemnitee settles the claim on
more favorable  terms,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall not be required to waive the
indemnity for such claim to the extent of the amount agreed to by Lessee.

     9.3.5 REFUND

     If any Tax Indemnitee receives a refund of, or becomes entitled to a credit
against other liability for, all or any part of any Taxes paid,  reimbursed,  or
advanced by Lessee,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall pay to Lessee within 30 days of
such  receipt an amount  equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of such refund or
credit plus any net tax benefit  (taking into account any Taxes incurred by such
Tax  Indemnitee by reason of the receipt of such refund or  realization  of such
credit)  actually  realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of any payment by
such Tax Indemnitee made pursuant to this sentence  (including this clause (a)),
and (b) such tax  payment,  reimbursement,  or  advance  by  Lessee  to such Tax
Indemnitee theretofore made pursuant to this ss. 9.3 (and the excess, if any, of
the amount described in clause (a) over the amount described in clause (b) shall
be carried forward and applied to reduce PRO TANTO any subsequent  obligation of
Lessee to make payments to such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this ss. 9.3). If, in
addition to such refund or credit,  sucH Tax Indemnitee receives (or is credited
with) an amount  representing  interest  on the amount of such refund or credit,
such Tax  Indemnitee  shall pay to  Lessee  within 30 days  after  receiving  or
realizing such credit the portion of such interest fairly  attributable to Taxes
paid,  reimbursed,  or advanced  by Lessee  before the receipt of such refund or
realization  of such credit.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a Tax Indemnitee
shall not be obligated to make any payment to Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3.5
if a Special Default or a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
If it is later  determined  thaT such Tax  Indemnitee  was not  entitled to such
refund or credit,  the  portion of the refund or credit  repaid,  recaptured  or
disallowed  (and any  interest and tax savings  paid by such Tax  Indemnitee  to
Lessee with  respect  thereto)  shall be treated as Taxes for which  Lessee must
indemnify  such Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 without  regard to ss.
9.3.2 hereof other than ss. 9.3.2(f).

     9.3.6 TAX FILING

     Lessee shall timely file any report,  return, or statement that is required
to be filed with  respect to any Tax which is subject to  indemnification  under
this ss. 9.3 (except  for any such  report,  return,  or  statement  which a Tax
Indemnitee  has  timely  notified  Lessee in  writing  that sucH Tax  Indemnitee
intends to file, or for which such Tax Indemnitee is required by law to file, in
its own name);  PROVIDED,  that the relevant Tax Indemnitee shall furnish Lessee
with any  information  in such Tax  Indemnitee's  possession  or control that is
reasonably  necessary to file any such  return,  report,  or statement  and that
Lessee  reasonably  requests  in writing  (but the Tax  Indemnitee  shall not be
required  to  furnish  copies of its  actual  tax  returns,  although  it may be
required to furnish relevant information contained therein). Lessee shall either
file such report,  return,  or statement and send a copy to such Tax  Indemnitee
(and to Owner  Trustee,  if the Tax  Indemnitee  is not Owner  Trustee),  or, if
Lessee is not  permitted to file such report,  return,  or  statement,  it shall
notify such Tax  Indemnitee  of such  requirement  and prepare and deliver  such
report,  return,  or statement  to such Tax  Indemnitee  in a manner  reasonably
satisfactory  to such Tax  Indemnitee  within a reasonable  time before the time
such report, return, or statement is to be filed.

     9.3.7 FORMS

     Each  Tax  Indemnitee  agrees  to  furnish  from  time to  time to  Lessee,
Mortgagee,  or such other  Person as Lessee or  Mortgagee  shall  designate,  at
Lessee's or Mortgagee's request, such duly-executed and properly-completed forms
as may be  necessary  or  appropriate  in  order to claim  any  reduction  of or
exemption from any withholding or other Tax imposed by any Taxing Authority,  if
(a) such  reduction or exemption  is available to such Tax  Indemnitee,  and (b)
Lessee has  provided  such Tax  Indemnitee  with any  information  necessary  to
complete such form not otherwise reasonably available to such Tax Indemnitee.

     9.3.8 NON-PARTIES

     If a Tax  Indemnitee is not a party to this  Agreement,  Lessee may require
the Tax  Indemnitee  to agree in writing,  in a form  reasonably  acceptable  to
Lessee,  to the terms of this ss. 9.3 and ss. 15.8 before  making any payment to
such Tax Indemnitee under this ss. 9.3.

     9.3.9 FOREIGN TAX ON LOAN PAYMENTS

     If an Owner Participant is incorporated or organized,  or maintains a place
of  business  in a country  other  than the  United  States  or in a  territory,
possession,  or commonwealth of the United States (within the meaning of the tax
law of that foreign jurisdiction),  and if as a result thereof any foreign Taxes
(including   withholding  Taxes)  are  imposed  on  the  Pass-Through  Trustees,
Pass-Through  Trusts,  or  Note  Holders,  then  such  Owner  Participant  shall
reimburse  Lessee for any  payments  that  Lessee is  required  to make to or on
behalf of any  Pass-Through  Trustee,  Pass-Through  Trust, or Note Holder under
this ss. 9.3 as a result of the imposition of such Taxes.  The amount payable by
Owner Participant to Lessee shall be an amount which,  after takinG into account
any such Taxes,  any Tax  imposed  upon the receipt or accrual by Lessee of such
payment by such Owner Participant,  and any tax benefits or tax savings realized
by Lessee  with  respect to the payment of such  withholding  Tax or the payment
hereunder,  shall equal the amount of  Lessee's  payment to or on behalf of such
Pass-Through Trustee or Note Holder.

     9.4 PAYMENTS

     Any payments  made  pursuant to ss. 9.1 or ss. 9.3 shall be due on the 30th
day after demand,  and shall be made directly to the relevant  IndemniTee or Tax
Indemnitee or to Lessee, in immediately  available funds at such bank or to such

Indemnitee  or Tax  Indemnitee  or Lessee (as  applicable)  by  certified  mail,
postage prepaid, at its address as set forth in this Agreement.

     9.5 INTEREST

     If any amount,  payable by Lessee,  any  Indemnitee,  or any Tax Indemnitee
under ss. 9.1 or ss. 9.3 is not paid when due, the Person obligated to mAke such
payment  shall pay on demand,  to the  extent  permitted  by Law,  to the Person
entitled thereto,  interest on any such amount for the period from and including
the due date for such amount to but  excluding  the date the amount is paid,  at
the Past-Due Rate.  Such interest shall be paid in the same manner as the unpaid
amount in respect of which such interest is due.

     9.6 BENEFIT OF INDEMNITIES

     Lessee's  obligations  for  indemnities,   obligations,   adjustments,  and
payments in ss. 9.1 or ss. 9.3 are expressly  made for the benefit of, and shAll

Participant to be indemnified, against such adverse tax consequence by a written
agreement  in form and  substance  and from a Person (if not Lessee)  reasonably
satisfactory to Owner Participant,  and such indemnification would not give rise

obligation  (other than the obligation to pay principal and interest and related
payments in respect of the New Debt),  cost,  or expense  (including  reasonable
attorneys'  fees)  related to or arising  out of any such  re-funding,  and such

to Lessee;

     (d) if two re-funding  transactions  have  previously  been  consummated at
Lessee's request pursuant to thisss. 11;

the  Weighted  Average  Life to Maturity of the New Debt to exceed the  Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of the Equipment  Notes, or (iii) the final maturity to
the New Debt to be later than the final maturity of the Equipment Notes; or

     (f) if the  structure  or  documentation  for such  re-funding  results  in
greater obligations or liabilities,  or lesser rights, of Owner Trustee or Owner
Participant,  compared to those contained in the structure and documentation for
the original Equipment Notes.

     Lessee,  Owner Participant,  Owner Trustee,  and Mortgagee will execute any

representation, warranty, certificate, opinion, or other document that Lessee or
any other Person reasonably requests).

     11.4 ERISA

     Owner   Participant  shall  not  be  obligated  to  conclude  the  proposed
re-funding  transaction  unless  the  agreements  used to effect it  contain  an
agreement by the initial holders of the New Debt  substantially  the same as ss.
7.5.2(b) of this  Agreement  (unless  the New Debt is sold in a public  offerinG
under the Securities Act or a private placement  intended for resale pursuant to
Rule 144A under the  Securities  Act,  in which case the holders of the New Debt
shall be subject to the restrictions relating to ERISA substantially the same as

     Lessee represents and warrants to Owner Participant and Owner Trustee that:

     6.1.1 Organization; Qualification

     Lessee is a corporation duly  incorporated,  validly existing,  and in good
standing under the Laws of Indiana, and has the corporate power and authority to
conduct the business in which it is  currently  engaged and to own or hold under
lease its  properties  and to enter into and perform its  obligations  under the
Lessee  Operative  Agreements.  Lessee is duly  qualified  to do  business  as a
foreign  corporation in good standing in each  jurisdiction  in which the nature
and extent of the business  conducted by it, or the ownership of its properties,
requires such  qualification,  except where the failure to be so qualified would
not give rise to a Materially Adverse Change to Lessee.

     6.1.2 Corporate Authorization

     Lessee has taken,  or caused to be taken,  all necessary  corporate  action
(including  obtaining  any consent or approval of  stockholders  required by its
articles of incorporation or by-laws) to authorize its execution,  delivery, and
performance of its obligations under each of the Lessee Operative Agreements.

     6.1.3 No Violation

     Lessee's execution,  delivery, and performance of its obligations under the
Lessee  Operative  Agreements  do not and will not (a) violate any  provision of
Lessee's articles of incorporation or by-laws, (b) violate any Law applicable to
or binding on Lessee, or (c) violate or constitute any default under (other than
any violation or default that would not result in a Materially Adverse Change to
Lessee),  or result in the creation of any Lien (other than as  permitted  under
the Lease) upon the Aircraft under, any lease, loan, or other material agreement
to which Lessee is a party or by which Lessee or any of its properties is bound.

     6.1.4 Approvals

     Lessee's  execution  and delivery of, and  performance  of its  obligations
under, the Lessee  Operative  Agreements do not and will not require the consent
or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration with, the recording or
filing of any  documents  with,  or the taking of any other action in respect of
(a) any  trustee  or other  holder  of any Debt of  Lessee,  (b) any  Government
Entity, or (c) any other Person,  other than (x) the FAA-Filed Documents and the
Financing  Statements  (and  continuation  statements  periodically),   and  (y)
filings,  recordings,  notices,  corporate  approvals of Lessee (which have been
duly obtained) or other ministerial  actions pursuant to any routine  recording,
contractual, or regulatory requirements.

     6.1.5 Valid and Binding Agreements

     The Lessee Operative  Agreements have been duly authorized,  executed,  and
delivered by Lessee,  and  (assuming  their due  authorization,  execution,  and
delivery by the other parties  thereto)  constitute  legal,  valid,  and binding
obligations  of Lessee and are  enforceable  against  Lessee in accordance  with
their  terms,  except  as such  enforceability  may be  limited  by  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  and other similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors  generally
and general principles of equity.

     6.1.6 Litigation

     Except as set forth in Guarantor's  most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,
filed by Lessee with the SEC on or before the Delivery Date, or in any Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or Current  Report on Form 8-K filed by  Guarantor  with the
SEC  subsequent to such Form 10-K and on or before the Delivery Date, no action,
claim,  or  proceeding  is  now  pending  or,  to  Lessee's  Actual   Knowledge,
threatened,  against Lessee,  Guarantor, or any of their Affiliates,  before any
Government Entity or any arbitrator,  that is reasonably likely to be determined
adversely  to Lessee and if  determined  adversely  to Lessee  would result in a
Materially Adverse Change.

     6.1.7 Financial Condition

     Guarantor's audited  consolidated  balance sheet for its most-recent fiscal
year, included in Guarantor's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Guarantor with
the SEC for  such  fiscal  year,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of
operations  and cash flows for the period  then  ended,  have been  prepared  in
accordance  with GAAP and fairly present in all material  respects the financial
condition of Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries as of such date and the
results of its operations and cash flows for such period,  and since the date of
such  balance  sheet,  there  has  been no  Materially  Adverse  Change  in such
financial  condition  or  operations,  except for matters  disclosed  in (a) the
financial  statements referred to above, or (b) any subsequent  Quarterly Report

     FSB and Owner  Trustee  hereby  (a) agree for the  benefit of Lessee not to
amend,  supplement,  terminate,  or otherwise  modify any provision of the Trust
Agreement  in a manner  that  adversely  affects  the  rights of any such  party
without the prior written  consent of such party,  and (b) agree for the benefit
of  Lessee  not to revoke  the trust  created  by the  Trust  Agreement  if such
revocation  would have an adverse  effect on Lessee.  Nothing in this  Agreement
shall  impair  any right  under the  Trust  Agreement  of FSB to resign as Owner
Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement.

     7.4 Other Agreements

     7.4.1 Owner Trustee Is Owner for All Purposes

     Lessee,  Owner Participant,  and Owner Trustee agree that for all purposes,
after the Closing,  Owner Trustee will be the owner of the Aircraft (except that
Owner  Participant will be the owner for income tax purposes) and Lessee will be
the lessee  thereof.  No transfer,  by operation of Law or  otherwise,  of Owner
Participant's  beneficial  interest in and to the Trust Estate shall  operate to
transfer legal title to any part of the Trust Estate to any transferee thereof.

     7.4.2 Commencement of Bankruptcy Proceedings

     Lessee, Owner Participant,  FSB, and Owner Trustee agree for the benefit of
each of the others that it will not commence or join in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy  Code to commence a case under ss. 303 of the Bankruptcy Code against
the Trust Estate.  Nothing  contained  herein shall be deemed to preclude  Owner
Participant,  FSB,  or Owner  Trustee  from  filing any claim  against the Trust
Estate in any case commenced against the Trust Estate.

     7.4.3 Quiet Enjoyment; Sale by Owner Trustee Binding

     (a) Owner  Participant  and Owner  Trustee  agree for the benefit of Lessee
that,  unless an Event of Default  exists,  such Person shall not interfere (and
shall not permit any Affiliate or other Person claiming by, through, or under it
to  interfere)  with Lessee's  rights in accordance  with the Lease to the quiet
enjoyment, possession, and use of the Aircraft during the Term.

     (b) Any assignment,  sale, transfer, or other conveyance of the Aircraft by
Owner  Trustee made  pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement or the Lease shall
bind Owner Participant,  and shall be effective to transfer or convey all right,
title,  and  interest  of Owner  Trustee  and  Owner  Participant  in and to the
Aircraft.  No purchaser or other  grantee shall be required to inquire as to the
authorization,  necessity,  expediency, or regularity of such assignment,  sale,
transfer, or conveyance,  or as to the application of any sale or other proceeds
with respect thereto by Owner Trustee, as regards Owner Participant.

     7.4.4 Other Documents; Amendment

     (a) Each of Owner  Participant  and Owner  Trustee  hereby  agrees  for the
benefit of Lessee not to amend, supplement, or otherwise modify any provision of
the Trust Agreement in a manner that could adversely affect such party,  without
the prior  written  consent  of such  party.  Owner  Trustee  agrees to  furnish
promptly to Lessee copies of any supplement,  amendment, waiver, or modification
of any of the Operative Agreements to which Lessee is not a party.

     (b) Owner  Trustee  agrees to join with Lessee to the extent that action on
its part is  necessary  or  appropriate  (1) to cause the  following  to be duly
accomplished in accordance with applicable United States federal Law by the time
the Aircraft is delivered  under this Agreement and the Lease:  (aa) to apply to
register  the  Aircraft in Owner  Trustee's  name,  and (bb) all related  action
necessary  in order for  Lessee to have  temporary  or  permanent  authority  to
operate the  Aircraft  as  contemplated  by the Lease,  and (2)  forthwith  upon
delivery  of the  Aircraft  under this  Agreement  and the  Lease,  to cause all
necessary documents to be duly filed for recording in accordance with applicable
United States federal Law.

     7.4.5 Consents

     Each of Owner  Participant  and Owner  Trustee  covenants  and agrees,  for
Lessee's  benefit,  that it shall not  unreasonably  withhold its consent to any
consent or approval  requested of it or of Owner  Trustee under the terms of any
of the  Operative  Agreements  which  by  its  terms  is not to be  unreasonably
withheld.

     7.4.6 Insurance

     Each of Owner  Participant  and  Owner  Trustee  agrees  not to  obtain  or
maintain  insurance for its own account as permitted by ss. 11.2 of the Lease if
such insurance would limit,  increase the cost of, or otherwise adversely affect
the coverage of any  insurance  required to be obtained or  maintained by Lessee
pursuant to ss. 11 and Annex D of the Lease.

     7.4.7 Foreign Registration

     (a) Owner  Participant and Owner Trustee hereby agree for Lessee's  benefit
that,  subject to ss.  7.1.2 of the Lease,  Lessee shall be entitled to register
the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft to be  registered in a country other than the
United States, if:

     (1) such registration is made only after the Tax Attribute  Period,  unless
Lessee prepays on a lump-sum basis any liability that would be due under the Tax
Indemnity  Agreement as a result of such registration  based upon the assumption
that such  registration  would  continue  for the  remainder  of the term of the
Permitted Sublease described in clause (3) below;

     (2) no  Special  Default  or Event of  Default  exists  at the time of such
registration;

     (3) such  proposed  change of  registration  is made in  connection  with a
Permitted  Sublease  to a  Permitted  Air  Carrier,  and  such  country  is such
Permitted Air Carrier's domicile;

     (4) such country is a country with which the United  States then  maintains
normal  diplomatic  relations  (or, if Taiwan,  the United States then maintains
diplomatic  relations at least as good as those in effect on the Delivery  Date,
provided  that Lessee may not effect such  registration  in Taiwan unless it has
obtained the prior written consent of Owner Participant, which Owner Participant
may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion); and

     (5) Owner  Participant  and Owner  Trustee  receive  an  opinion of counsel
(subject to customary exceptions) reasonably  satisfactory to Owner Participant,
addressed to each such party, to the effect that:

     (aa) such country  recognizes  Owner  Trustee's  ownership  interest in the
Aircraft;

     (bb) Lessee's obligations,  and Owner Trustee's rights and remedies,  under
the  Lease  are  valid,   binding,  and  enforceable  under  the  laws  of  such
jurisdiction;

     (cc) after giving effect to such change in  registration,  Owner  Trustee's
title continues as a valid and protected interest, and all filing, recording, or
other  action   necessary  to  protect  Owner   Trustee's   interest  have  been
accomplished  (or, if such opinion  cannot be given at the time of such proposed
change in registration because such change in registration is not yet effective,
(1) the  opinion  shall  detail  what  filing,  recording,  or other  action  is
necessary,  and  (2)  Owner  Participant  and  Owner  Trustee  shall  receive  a
certificate  from Lessee  that all  possible  preparations  to  accomplish  such
filing,  recording,  and other action are done, and such filing,  recording, and
other action are accomplished,  and a supplemental  opinion to that effect shall
be delivered to Owner Participant and Owner Trustee promptly after the effective
date of such change in registration;

     (dd)  it is not  necessary,  solely  as a  consequence  of such  change  in
registration and without giving effect to any other activity of Owner Trustee or
Owner  Participant,  for Owner  Trustee  or Owner  Participant  to qualify to do
business in such jurisdiction as a result of such  reregistration or in order to
exercise any rights or remedies  with  respect to the  Aircraft  pursuant to the
Lease;

     (ee) there is no tort  liability  of the owner or lessor of an aircraft not
in possession thereof under the laws of such jurisdiction (it being agreed that,
if  such  latter  opinion  cannot  be  given  in a form  satisfactory  to  Owner
Participant,  such opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably  satisfactory
to Owner Participant is provided to cover such risk); and

     (ff)  unless  Lessee  agrees  to  provide  insurance  covering  the risk of
requisition of use of the Aircraft by the government of such country (so long as
the Aircraft is  registered  under the laws of such  country),  the laws of such
country  require fair  compensation by the government of such country payable in
currency freely  convertible into Dollars and freely removable from such country
(without  license or permit,  unless Lessee before such proposed  reregistration
has  obtained  such  license or permit)  for the taking or  requisition  by such
government of such use.

         (b)  In   addition,   as  a  condition   precedent  to  any  change  in
registration,  Lessee  shall  give to Owner  Participant  assurances  reasonably
satisfactory to each of them:

     (1) that the provisions ofss. 11 of the Lease have been complied with after
giving effect to such change of registration;

     (2)  of  Lessee's  payment,  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  all  reasonable
out-of-pocket  expenses of Lessor and Owner  Participant in connection with such
change of registry,  including (aa) the  reasonable  fees and  disbursements  of
counsel to Lessee and  Lessor,  (bb) any filing or  recording  fees,  Taxes,  or
similar  payments  incurred in connection with the change of registration of the
Aircraft; and

     (3) that the tax and other  indemnities in favor of each Person named as an
indemnitee  under  any other  Operative  Agreement  afford  to each such  Person
substantially the same protection as provided before such change of registration
(or Lessee agrees to provide,  or cause to be provided,  additional  indemnities
that,  together with such original  indemnities,  in the reasonable  judgment of
Owner Participant and Lessor, afford such protection).

     7.4.8 Other Commercial Relations Unaffected

     Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  any  Operative
Agreement:

     (a) except as set forth in the Purchase  Agreement  Assignment,  nothing in
the Operative  Agreements shall constitute or be deemed to be a waiver by Lessee
of any rights,  remedies, or claims it may have against Airframe Manufacturer or
Engine  Manufacturer  or any  subcontractor  or  supplier  of  either;  and  the
Operative  Agreements  do not and shall not be construed or deemed to create any
rights, waivers,  immunities,  or indemnities in favor of Airframe Manufacturer,
Engine Manufacturer,  or any subcontractor or supplier of either with respect to
any such rights, remedies, or claims of Lessee; and

     (b) neither  Airframe  Manufacturer,  by its  execution and delivery of the
Consent and Agreement, nor Engine Manufacturer, by its execution and delivery of
the Engine Manufacturer  Warranty Agreement,  shall be deemed to have waived any
rights,  remedies,  or claims which Airframe Manufacturer or Engine Manufacturer
(or any  subcontractor  or  supplier  of either)  has  against  Lessee;  and the
Operative  Agreements  do not and shall not be construed or deemed to create any
rights, waivers,  immunities,  or indemnities in favor of Lessee with respect to
any such  rights,  remedies,  or  claims  of  Airframe  Manufacturer  or  Engine
Manufacturer (or any subcontractor or supplier of either).

     7.4.9 Interest in Certain Engines

     Owner  Participant and Owner Trustee agree, for the benefit of each lessor,
conditional  seller,  or  secured  party of any  airframe  or engine  leased to,
purchased by, or owned by Lessee or any Permitted  Sublessee subject to a lease,
conditional sale, or other security agreement that it will not acquire or claim,
as against such lessor,  conditional seller, or secured party, any right, title,
or  interest in any engine as the result of the  installation  of such engine on
the Airframe at any time while such engine is subject to such lease, conditional
sale, or other security agreement and owned by such lessor or conditional seller
or subject to a security interest in favor of such secured party.

     8. CONFIDENTIALITY

     Lessee, Owner Participant, and Owner Trustee shall keep Annexes B, C, and D
and  Schedules 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the Lease,  the  Participation  Agreement,  the
Purchase Agreement Assignment, and the Tax Indemnity Agreement confidential, and
shall not disclose  them, or cause them to be disclosed,  to any Person,  except
(a) to prospective and permitted  transferees of Lessee's,  Owner Participant's,
or Owner Trustee's  interest or their counsel,  independent  insurance  brokers,
auditors, or other agents who agree to hold such information  confidential,  (b)
to  Lessee's,  Owner  Participant's,  or Owner  Trustee's  counsel,  independent
insurance brokers, auditors, or other agents, Affiliates, or investors who agree
to hold such  information  confidential,  (c) as may be required by any statute,
court, or administrative  order or decree, legal process, or governmental ruling
or regulation,  including those of any applicable  insurance  regulatory  bodies
(including  the National  Association  of Insurance  Commissioners),  federal or
state  banking  examiners,  Internal  Revenue  Service  auditors,  or any  stock
exchange, (d) with respect to Lessee and Owner Participant,  by mutual agreement
of such parties, or (e) to such other Persons as are reasonably deemed necessary
by the  disclosing  party in order to protect the interests of such party or for
the purposes of enforcing such documents by such party;  provided,  that any and
all disclosures  permitted by clauses (c), (d), and (e) above shall be made only
to the  extent  necessary  to meet  the  specific  requirements  or needs of the
Persons making such disclosures.

     (k) to the extent attributable to any amount which any Indemnitee expressly

reimbursed by Lessee;

     (l) to the extent that it is an ordinary  and usual  operating  or overhead
expense of such Indemnitee;

     (m) with  respect to Owner  Participant  or Owner  Trustee,  or any related
Indemnitee,  to the extent  attributable to the  deregistration  of the Aircraft
under the Transportation  Code as a result of the failure of such Person (or any
related  Indemnitee  of such  Person) to be a Citizen of the United  States as a
result of any act (other than  reregistration  of the  Aircraft  pursuant to ss.
7.1.2  of the  Lease)  of Owner  Participant  or Owner  Trustee  or any  related

Indemnitee,  a director,  officer,  employee, or agent of such Indemnitee or any
such  Affiliate,  or a successor or permitted  assignee of any of the foregoing;
provided,  that  Owner  Trustee  and  FSB  shall  not be  deemed  to be  related
Indemnitees  of Owner  Participant  merely  because of their trust or  fiduciary
relationships.

     9.1.3 Separate Agreement

     This  Agreement  constitutes  a  separate  agreement  with  respect to each
Indemnitee, and is enforceable directly by each such Indemnitee.

     9.1.4 Notice

     If an Indemnitee makes a claim for any Expense indemnifiable under this ss.
9.1,  such  Indemnitee  shall  give  prompt  written  notice  thereof to Lessee.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  Indemnitee's  failure to notify Lessee as
provided in this ss. 9.1.4,  or in ss. 9.1.5,  shall not release Lessee from any
of its obligations to indemnify such Indemnitee hereunder,  except to the extent
that such  failure  results in an  additional  Expense to Lessee (in which event
Lessee  shall not be  responsible  for such  additional  expense) or  materially
impairs Lessee's ability to contest such claim.

     9.1.5 Notice of Proceedings; Defense of Claims; Limitations

     (a) If any action,  suit,  or  proceeding  for which Lessee is  responsible
under this ss. 9.1 is brought  against any  Indemnitee,  such  Indemnitee  shall
notify  Lessee of the  commencement  thereof,  and Lessee may,  at its  expense,
participate in and, to the extent that it so desires  (subject to the provisions
of the following paragraph),  assume and control its defense and, subject to ss.
9.1.5(c),  settle or compromise it. Unless Owner  Participant  agrees in writing
otherwise, no settlement of any claim hereunder may require Owner Participant to
agree to any remedy  apart from the  payment  of money  damages  (for which such
payment of money damages Lessee will in any event indemnify the Indemnitees).

     (b) Lessee or its insurer(s) shall have the right, at its or their expense,
to investigate or, if Lessee or its insurer(s) agree not to dispute liability to
the Indemnitee giving notice of such action,  suit, or proceeding under this ss.
9.1.5 for indemnification  hereunder or under any insurance policies pursuant to
which  coverage  is sought,  control  the  defense  of,  any  action,  suit,  or
proceeding, relating to any Expense for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this  ss.  9.1,  and each  Indemnitee  shall  cooperate  with  Lessee  or its
insurer(s) with respect thereto;  provided, that Lessee shall not be entitled to
control the defense of any such action,  suit,  or  proceeding,  or to settle or
compromise any such Expense,  (i) while any Special  Default or Event of Default
under ss. 14.1 of the Lease exists, or (ii) if such action,  suit, or proceeding
will  involve  a  material  risk of the  sale,  forfeiture,  or loss of,  or the
creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted  Lien) on the  Aircraft,  the Trust
Estate,  or any part  thereof,  unless  Lessee shall have posted a bond or other
security or  collateral  satisfactory  to Owner  Participant  in respect to such
risk,  or (iii) if such  action,  suit,  or  proceeding  could in the good faith
opinion of such  Indemnitee  entail any risk of criminal  liability  or material
civil liability or present a conflict of interest making separate representation
necessary.  In  connection  with any such  Lessee-controlled  action,  suit,  or
proceeding,  such Indemnitee shall have the right to participate therein, at its
sole cost and expense, with counsel reasonably  satisfactory to Lessee, provided
that such Indemnitee's  participation does not, in the reasonable opinion of the
independent  counsel  appointed  by  Lessee  or its  insurers  to  conduct  such
proceedings, interfere with the defense of such case.

     (c) In no event  shall any  Indemnitee  enter  into a  settlement  or other
compromise  with respect to any Expense  without  Lessee's prior written consent
(which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  unless such Indemnitee
waives its right to be  indemnified  with respect to such Expense under this ss.
9.1.

     (d) To the extent that any Expense  indemnified by Lessee  hereunder may be
covered by insurance maintained by Lessee, at Lessee's expense,  each Indemnitee
agrees  to  cooperate  with the  insurers  in the  exercise  of their  rights to
investigate, defend, or compromise that Expense as may be required to retain the
benefits of the insurance for that Expense.

     (e) If an Indemnitee is not a party to this  Agreement,  Lessee may require
that  Indemnitee  to agree in  writing  to the terms of this ss. 9 and ss.  15.8
before making any payment to such Indemnitee under this ss. 9.

     (f) Nothing  herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of any residual value
of the Aircraft.

     (g) Nothing in this ss. 9.1.5 shall  require an  Indemnitee  to contest any
Expense or to assume  responsibility  for or control of any judicial  proceeding
with respect thereto.

     9.1.6 Information

     Lessee will  provide the  relevant  Indemnitee  with such  information  not
within the control of such  Indemnitee  (but in Lessee's  control or  reasonably
available  to  Lessee)  which  such  Indemnitee  reasonably  requests,  and will
otherwise  cooperate  with such  Indemnitee  so as to enable such  Indemnitee to
fulfill its  obligations  under ss. 9.1.5 and to control or  participate  in any
proceeding to the extent  permitted by ss. 9.1.5.  The  Indemnitee  shall supply
Lessee  with such  information  not  within the  control of Lessee  (but in such
Indemnitee's  control or reasonably  available to such Indemnitee)  which Lessee
reasonably  requests to control or  participate  in any proceeding to the extent
permitted by ss. 9.1.5.

     9.1.7 Effect of Other Indemnities; Subrogation; Further Assurances

     Upon  payment in full by or on behalf of Lessee of any  indemnity  provided
for under this  Agreement,  without  any  further  action and to the full extent
permitted by Law,  Lessee will be  subrogated  to all rights and remedies of the
Person  indemnified  (other  than  with  respect  to  any of  such  Indemnitee's
insurance  policies or in connection with any indemnity claim of such Indemnitee
under ss.  5.3 or ss. 7 of the Trust  Agreement)  in respect of the matter as to
which such indemnity was paid. Each Indemnitee will give such further assurances
or  agreements  and  cooperate  with Lessee to permit  Lessee to pursue any such
claims, to the extent reasonably requested by Lessee and at Lessee's expense.

     9.1.8 Refunds

     If an Indemnitee  receives any refund, in whole or in part, with respect to
any  Expense  paid by or on behalf of Lessee  hereunder,  that  Indemnitee  will
promptly  pay the  amount  refunded  (but not an amount in excess of the  amount
Lessee or any of its  insurers  has paid in  respect  of such  Expense)  over to
Lessee  unless an Event of Default  exists,  in which case such amount  shall be
paid over to Owner  Trustee to hold as security for Lessee's  obligations  under
the Lessee Operative  Agreements or, if requested by Lessee,  applied to satisfy
those obligations. Any subsequent loss of such recovery or tax benefit or refund
shall be subject to the provisions of ss. 9.1 and ss. 9.3.

     9.2 Expenses

     9.2.1 Invoices and Payment

     Owner Trustee and Owner Participant shall promptly submit to Lessee for its
prompt approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) copies of invoices in
reasonable  detail of the  Transaction  Expenses for which it is responsible for
providing  information  as they are  received  (and not later  than the 90th day
after the Delivery Date). If so submitted and approved, Owner Participant agrees
promptly  (and not later than the later of (i) the 105th day after the  Delivery
Date and (ii) the  tenth  Business  Day  following  such  approval)  to pay such
Transaction Expenses . Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lessee at its sole option
shall have the right to pay directly any and all Transaction Expenses payable to
Lessee  Advisor  or  Lessee's  counsel  or (if such  payment  does not result in
adverse tax  consequences to Owner  Participant)  to any other Person.  If Owner
Participant  fails to pay any  Transaction  Expense  that it is obligated to pay
hereunder, Lessee shall pay such Transaction Expense. Any such payment by Lessee
shall not affect Owner  Participant's  obligations  or Lessee's  rights  against
Owner Participant for its failure to make any such payment.

     9.2.2 Payment of Other Expenses

     Lessee shall pay (a) the ongoing fees and  expenses of Owner  Trustee,  and
(b) all reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses  (including the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by Owner Participant attributable to
(1) any transfer of title to the Aircraft or any Engine  contemplated by ss. 4.5
of the Lease,  or (2) any waiver,  amendment,  or  modification of any Operative
Agreement to the extent requested by Lessee.

     9.2.3 Indemnification Interest

     Lessee will pay to each Indemnitee upon demand,  to the extent permitted by
applicable  Law,  interest at the Past Due Rate on any amount of  indemnity  not
paid when due pursuant to this ss. 9 until the same shall be paid.

     9.3 General Tax Indemnity

     9.3.1 General

     Except as provided in ss.  9.3.2,  Lessee  agrees that each payment of Rent
paid by Lessee pursuant to the Lease, and any other payment or indemnity paid by
Lessee to a Tax Indemnitee under any Operative  Agreement,  shall be free of all
withholdings or deductions with respect to Taxes of any nature, and if Lessee is
required by  applicable  law to make any such  withholding  or deduction for any
such payment, (a) Lessee shall make all such withholdings or deductions, (b) the
amount  payable by Lessee shall be increased so that,  after making all required
withholdings or deductions, such Tax Indemnitee receives the same amount that it
would have received had no such  withholdings  or deductions  been made, and (c)
Lessee  shall pay the full amount  withheld or deducted to the  relevant  Taxing
Authority in accordance  with  applicable  law. Except as provided in ss. 9.3.2,
and whether or not any of the Transactions  are  consummated,  Lessee shall pay,
indemnify,  protect,  defend,  and hold harmless on an after-tax  basis each Tax
Indemnitee from all Taxes imposed by any Taxing Authority imposed on or asserted
against any Tax  Indemnitee or the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  any Engine,  or any
Part,  or any  interest  in any of the  foregoing  (whether  or not  indemnified
against by any other Person),  upon or with respect to the Operative Agreements,
their execution, or the transactions or payments contemplated thereby, including
any Tax imposed  upon or with respect to (w) the  Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  any
Engine,  any  Part,  any  Operative  Agreement,  any data,  or any  other  thing
delivered or to be delivered  under an Operative  Agreement,  (x) the  purchase,
manufacture,  acceptance, rejection, sale, transfer of title, return, ownership,
delivery,  transport,  charter, rental, lease, re-lease,  sublease,  assignment,
possession,   repossession,  presence,  use,  condition,  storage,  preparation,
maintenance,  modification,  alteration,  improvement,  operation, registration,
transfer  or  change  of  registration,   reregistration,  repair,  replacement,
overhaul,  location, control, imposition of any Lien (other than a Lessor Lien),
financing, refinancing requested by Lessee, abandonment, or other disposition of
the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  any Engine, any Part, any data, or any other thing
delivered  or to be  delivered  under  an  Operative  Agreement,  or  (y)  rent,
interest, fees, or other income, proceeds, receipts, or earnings, whether actual
or  deemed,  arising  upon,  in  connection  with,  or in  respect of any of the
Operative  Agreements  (including  the property or income or other proceeds with
respect  to  property  held as part of the  Trust  Estate)  or the  transactions
contemplated thereby.

subject  to  such  Taxes  by  such   jurisdiction  but  for  (i)  the  location,
registration,  use, or operation of the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  any Engine, or
any Part  thereof  by a Lessee  Person  within  the  jurisdiction  of the Taxing
Authority imposing such Tax, or (ii) the activities of any Lessee Person (except

of business in such jurisdiction);

     (c) on, with  respect to, or  measured  by any trustee  fees,  commissions,
premiums, or compensation received by Owner Trustee;

     (d) on the Trust or the Trust  Estate  that result  from  treatment  of the

apart from Owner Participant;

     (e) that are being contested as provided inss. 9.3.4 during the pendency of
such contest;

     (f) imposed on any Tax Indemnitee to the extent that such Taxes result from
the  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of such Tax  Indemnitee  or any
Affiliate thereof (other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct imputed
to such Tax Indemnitee by reason of such Tax  Indemnitee's  participation in the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements);

     (g)  imposed  on  or  with  respect  to a  Tax  Indemnitee  (including  the
transferee  in those  cases in which the Tax on  transfer  is imposed  on, or is
collected from, the  transferee) as a result of a transfer or other  disposition
(including a deemed transfer or disposition) by such Tax Indemnitee or a related
Tax Indemnitee (or, in the case of Owner Participant,  by Owner Trustee,  or, in
the case of Taxes imposed on a transferee, by the transferor) of any interest in
the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  any Engine,  or any Part, the Rent, the Trust, the
Trust Estate, the Lease, or any interest arising under the Operative  Agreements
or a transfer or disposition (including a deemed transfer or disposition) of any
interest  in a Tax  Indemnitee  (other  than  (1) a  substitution,  replacement,
modification,  pooling, or improvement of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine
or any Part by a Lessee Person that is treated for Tax purposes as a transfer or
disposition,  (2) a  transfer  pursuant  to  an  exercise  of  remedies  upon  a
then-existing  Event of Default,  (3) a transfer  pursuant toss. 17.3 orss. 9 of
the Lease, or (4) a transfer pursuant to an Event of Loss);

     (h) in excess of those that would  have been  imposed  had there not been a
transfer  or other  disposition  by or to such Tax  Indemnitee  or a related Tax
Indemnitee described in clause (g) of this ss. 9.3.2;

     (i) imposed on Owner  Participant and indemnified by Lessee pursuant to the
Tax Indemnity Agreement;

     (j) imposed  with  respect to any period  after the  expiration  or earlier
termination of the Term and, if required pursuant to the terms of the Lease, the
return of  possession  of the  Aircraft to Lessor or placement in storage at the
request of Lessor in accordance with the Lease  (provided,  that this clause (j)
shall  not apply to Taxes  imposed  after  such  period  arising  as a result of
payments  by Lessee  under the  Operative  Agreements  after such  period or are
attributable to events  occurring prior to or coincident with such expiration or
earlier termination of the Term);

     (k) consisting of any interest, penalties, or additions to tax imposed on a
Tax  Indemnitee  as a result  (in  whole or in  part) of a  failure  of such Tax
Indemnitee or a related Tax  Indemnitee to file any return  properly and timely,
unless such failure is caused by Lessee's failure to fulfill its obligations, if
any, under ss. 9.3.6 with respect to such return;

     (l) resulting from, or that would not have been imposed but for, any Lessor
Liens  arising  as a result  of  claims  against,  or acts or  omissions  of, or
otherwise attributable to such Tax Indemnitee or a related Tax Indemnitee;

     (m)  imposed  on any Tax  Indemnitee  as a result of the breach by such Tax
Indemnitee or a related Tax Indemnitee of any covenant of such Tax Indemnitee or
any Affiliate thereof contained in any Operative  Agreement or the inaccuracy of
any  representation  or warranty by such Tax Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof
in any Operative Agreement;

     (n) in the nature of an  intangible  or similar Tax upon or with respect to
the value of the interest of Owner Participant in the Trust Estate or the Trust,
only if such  Taxes are in the  nature  of  franchise  Taxes or result  from the
conduct of business by such Tax  Indemnitee in the taxing  jurisdiction  and are
imposed because of the place of incorporation or the activities unrelated to the
Transactions in the taxing jurisdiction of such Tax Indemnitee;

     (o) that is included in Lessor's  Cost and paid to the  appropriate  Taxing
Authority;

     (p) other than any Tax described in ss. 9.3.2(b)  hereof,  imposed on a Tax
Indemnitee by a Taxing Authority of a jurisdiction outside the United States, to
the extent  that such Taxes  would not have been  imposed  but for a  connection
between the Tax  Indemnitee or a related Tax  Indemnitee  and such  jurisdiction
imposing such Tax unrelated to the Transactions; or

     (q) relating to ERISA or to Codess. 4975.

     For purposes hereof, a Tax Indemnitee and any other Tax Indemnitees who are
successors,  assigns,  agents,  or  Affiliates of such Tax  Indemnitee  shall be
related Tax Indemnitees.

     9.3.3 Payment

     (a) Without regard to ss. 9.3.2(a),  (b), or (h) hereof, Lessee's indemnity
obligation  to a Tax  Indemnitee  under this ss. 9.3 shall be the amount  which,
after  taking into  account  any Tax imposed  upon the receipt or accrual of the
amounts payable under this ss. 9.3 and any tax benefits  actually  recognized by
such Tax Indemnitee as a result of the indemnifiable Tax (including any benefits
recognized as a result of such Tax Indemnitee's use of an indemnifiable Tax as a
credit against Taxes not indemnifiable under this ss. 9.3), equals the amount of
the Tax indemnifiable under this ss. 9.3.

     (b) At Lessee's  request,  the  computation  of the amount of any indemnity
payment owed by Lessee or any amount owed by a Tax Indemnitee to Lessee pursuant
to this ss.  9.3  shall be  verified  and  certified  by an  independent  public
accounting  firm selected by such Tax Indemnitee and reasonably  satisfactory to
Lessee.  Such  verification  shall be  binding.  The costs of such  verification
(including  the fee of such  public  accounting  firm)  shall be borne by Lessee
unless such  verification  results in an adjustment  in Lessee's  favor of 5% or
more of the net present value of the payment as computed by such Tax Indemnitee,
in which case such Tax Indemnitee shall pay those costs.

     (c) Each Tax Indemnitee shall provide Lessee with such certifications,  and
such  information and  documentation  in such Tax  Indemnitee's  possession,  as
Lessee  reasonably  requests to minimize any indemnity  payment pursuant to this
ss. 9.3;  provided,  that  notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this ss.
9.3.3(c),  no Tax  Indemnitee  shall be required to provide  Lessee with any Tax
returns.

     (d) Each Tax  Indemnitee  shall  promptly  forward  to Lessee  any  written
notice,  bill,  or advice  that such Tax  Indemnitee  receives  from any  Taxing
Authority concerning any Tax for which it seeks  indemnification  under this ss.
9.3. Lessee shall pay any amount for which it is liable pursuant to this ss. 9.3
directly to the appropriate  Taxing  Authority if legally  permissible,  or upon
demand of a Tax Indemnitee, to such Tax Indemnitee within 30 days of such demand
(or, if a contest  occurs in accordance  with ss. 9.3.4,  within 30 days after a
Final Determination (as defined below)),  but in no event more than one Business
Day before the related Tax is due. If requested by a Tax  Indemnitee in writing,
Lessee  shall  furnish to the  appropriate  Tax  Indemnitee  the  original  or a
certified copy of a receipt for Lessee's  payment of any Tax paid by Lessee,  or
such  other  evidence  of  payment  of such  Tax as is  acceptable  to such  Tax
Indemnitee. Lessee shall also furnish promptly upon written request such data as
any Tax Indemnitee  reasonably  requires to enable such Tax Indemnitee to comply
with the  requirements  of any  taxing  jurisdiction,  unless  such data are not
reasonably  available to Lessee or (unless such data are specifically  requested
by a Taxing  Authority) are not  customarily  furnished by domestic air carriers
under   similar   circumstances.   For  purposes  of  this  ss.  9.3,  a  "Final
Determination" is (1) a decision,  judgment, decree, or other order by any court
of competent  jurisdiction  that occurs pursuant to the provisions of ss. 9.3.4,
which  decision,   judgment,  decree,  or  other  order  has  become  final  and
unappealable,  (2) a closing  agreement or settlement  agreement entered into in
accordance  with ss. 9.3.4 that has become binding and is not subject to further
review or appeal (absent fraud, misrepresentation, etc.), or (3) the termination
of  administrative  proceedings and the expiration of the time for instituting a
claim in a court proceeding.

     (e) If any Tax Indemnitee  actually realizes a tax savings by reason of any
Tax paid or  indemnified  by Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 (whether  such tax
savings  arise by means of a foreign tax credit,  depreciation  or cost recovery
deduction, or otherwise),  and such savings are not otherwise taken into account
in computing such payment or indemnity,  such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to Lessee
an amount  equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of such tax  savings,  plus any
additional net tax savings recognized as the result of any payment made pursuant
to this sentence,  when, as, if, and to the extent realized,  and (2) the amount
of all payments  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 by Lessee to such Tax Indemnitee (less
any payments  previously  made by such Tax Indemnitee to Lessee pursuant to this
ss.  9.3.3(e))  (and the excess,  if any, of the amount  described in clause (1)
over the amount  described in clause (2) shall be carried forward and applied to
reduce pro tanto any  subsequent  obligations of Lessee to make payments to such
Tax  Indemnitee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3);  provided,  that such Tax Indemnitee
shall not be required to make any payment pursuant to this sentence so long as a
Special  Default or an Event of Default of a monetary  nature  exists.  If a tax
benefit is later  disallowed  or denied,  the  disallowance  or denial  shall be
treated as a Tax indemnifiable  under ss. 9.3.1 without regard to the provisions
of ss. 9.3.2 (other than ss.  9.3.2(f)).  Each such Tax Indemnitee shall in good
faith use  reasonable  efforts in filing  its tax  returns  and in dealing  with
Taxing Authorities to seek and claim any such tax benefit.

     9.3.4 Contest

     (a) If a written  claim is made  against a Tax  Indemnitee  for Taxes  that
Lessee could be liable to pay or indemnify for hereunder, or if a Tax Indemnitee
determines that a Tax is due and that Lessee could have an indemnity  obligation
for that Tax  hereunder,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall  promptly  notify Lessee in
writing of such claim  (provided,  that  failure so to notify  Lessee  shall not
relieve  Lessee of its  indemnity  obligations  hereunder  unless the failure to
notify  effectively  forecloses  Lessee's  rights to  require a contest  of such
claim),  and shall take no action with  respect to such claim  without  Lessee's
prior written  consent for 30 days  following  Lessee's  receipt of such notice;
provided,  that, if applicable  Law requires such Tax  Indemnitee to take action
before the end of such 30-day period,  such Tax Indemnitee shall, in such notice
to Lessee, so inform Lessee, and such Tax Indemnitee shall take no action for as
long as it is legally able to avoid taking action (and a Tax Indemnitee shall be
entitled  to pay the Tax  claimed  and sue for a refund  before  the end of such
30-day period if (1)(aa) the failure to pay the Tax would result in  substantial
penalties  (unless  immediately  reimbursed by Lessee) and the act of paying the
Tax would not materially  prejudice the right to contest, or (bb) the failure to
pay would result in criminal  penalties,  and (2) such Tax Indemnitee shall take
any action so required in connection  with so paying the Tax in a manner that is
the least  prejudicial  to the pursuit of the  contest).  In addition,  such Tax
Indemnitee   shall  (provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  agreed  to  keep  such
information  confidential other than to the extent necessary in order to contest
the claim) furnish Lessee with copies of any requests for  information  from any
Taxing  Authority  relating  to such Taxes with  respect to which  Lessee may be
required to indemnify  hereunder.  If  requested by Lessee in writing  within 30
days after its receipt of such notice,  such Tax Indemnitee  shall,  at Lessee's
expense (including all reasonable costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' and
accountants' fees and disbursements), in good faith contest (or, if permitted by
applicable law, allow Lessee to contest) through appropriate  administrative and
judicial proceedings the validity, applicability, or amount of such Taxes by (x)
resisting  payment  thereof,  (y) not paying the Taxes except  under  protest if
protest is necessary and proper, or (z) if the payment is made, using reasonable
efforts to obtain a refund thereof in an appropriate  administrative or judicial
proceeding. If requested to do so by Lessee, the Tax Indemnitee shall appeal any
adverse  administrative  or judicial  decision,  except that the Tax  Indemnitee
shall not be required to pursue any appeals to the United States  Supreme Court.
If and to the extent that the Tax  Indemnitee  is able to separate the contested
issue(s)  from other  issues  arising  in the same  administrative  or  judicial
proceeding  that  are  unrelated  to  the  Transactions  without  (in  such  Tax
Indemnitee's good faith judgment) adversely affecting such Tax Indemnitee,  such
Tax Indemnitee shall permit Lessee to control the conduct of any such proceeding
and shall provide to Lessee (at Lessee's cost and expense) with such information
or data in such Tax Indemnitee's  control or possession and reasonably necessary
to conduct such contest  (other than such Tax  Indemnitee's  federal  income Tax
returns) in which case Lessee shall keep such Tax Indemnitee reasonably informed
concerning the progress of such contest. If the contest is being controlled by a
Tax  Indemnitee,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall  consult with Lessee in good faith
regarding the manner of contesting  such claim and shall keep Lessee  reasonably
informed regarding the progress of such contest. A Tax Indemnitee shall not fail
to take any action  expressly  required by this ss. 9.3.4  (including any action
regarding any appeal of an adverse  determination  with respect to any claim) or
settle or compromise any claim without Lessee's prior written consent (except as
contemplated by ss. 9.3.4(b) or (c)).

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in no event shall a Tax Indemnitee be
required  to pursue any  contest  (or to permit  Lessee to pursue  any  contest)
unless  (1)  Lessee  agrees to pay to such Tax  Indemnitee  on demand  and on an
after-tax  basis all  reasonable  costs and  expenses  that such Tax  Indemnitee
incurs in  connection  with  contesting  such Taxes,  including  all  reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees
and disbursements, (2) if such contest involves the payment of the claim, Lessee
advances the amount thereof (to the extent indemnified hereunder) plus interest,
penalties,  and  additions to tax with  respect  thereto that are required to be
paid before  commencing the contest on an  interest-free  net after-Tax basis to
such Tax Indemnitee,  (3) such Tax Indemnitee does not reasonably determine that
the action to be taken will result in any material risk of forfeiture,  sale, or
loss of the Aircraft (unless Lessee makes provisions to protect the interests of
any  such  Tax  Indemnitee  in a  manner  reasonably  satisfactory  to such  Tax
Indemnitee)  (provided,  that such Tax Indemnitee shall notify Lessee in writing
promptly  after it  becomes  aware of any such  risk),  (4) no Event of  Default
exists,  unless Lessee has provided  security for its  obligations  hereunder by
advancing to such Tax  Indemnitee,  before  proceeding or  continuing  with such
contest, the amount of the Tax being contested,  plus any interest and penalties
and an amount  estimated in good faith by such Tax Indemnitee for expenses,  (5)
before commencing any judicial action controlled by Lessee,  Lessee acknowledges
its liability for such claim hereunder in writing,  provided,  that Lessee shall
not be  bound  by its  acknowledgment  if the  Final  Determination  articulates
conclusions  of law and fact that  demonstrate  that Lessee has no liability for
the contested amounts hereunder,  (6) such Tax Indemnitee shall have received at
Lessee's sole expense,  an opinion  independent tax counsel,  such counsel to be
selected by Lessee and  reasonably  satisfactory  to such Tax  Indemnitee  ("Tax
Counsel"),  to the effect  that a  reasonable  basis,  within the meaning of ABA
Formal Opinion No. 85-352,  exists for contesting such claim,  (7) the amount of
payments  or  indemnification  that  would  be  required  as a  result  of  such
adjustment, when aggregated with further potential payments or adjustments where
the subject matter of the proposed  adjustment is of a continuing  nature, as to
the  Aircraft  and all other  aircraft  operated  by  Lessee,  shall be at least
$10,000,  and (8) the issue  shall not be  substantially  identical  as an issue
previously contested hereunder and decided adversely, unless such Tax Indemnitee
shall have received,  at Lessee's sole expense,  a written opinion,  in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee,  of Tax Counsel to the
effect  that  the  applicable  circumstances  or law have  changed  and in light
thereof,  there is reasonable basis under ABA Formal Opinion No. 85-352 that the
tax  treatment  of the item which is the  subject of the claim will be upheld in
litigation if the claimed tax  treatment is  challenged  by a Taxing  Authority.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,   if  any  Tax  Indemnitee  releases,   waives,
compromises,  or settles any claim that may be  indemnifiable by Lessee pursuant
to this ss. 9.3 and which such Tax Indemnitee is otherwise  obligated to contest
under this ss. 9.3.4 without Lessee's written permission, Lessee's obligation to
indemnify   such  Tax   Indemnitee   with   respect   to  such  claim  (and  all
directly-related  claims,  and claims  based on the outcome of such claim) shall
terminate,  subject  to ss.  9.3.4(c),  and  subject to ss.  9.3.4(c),  such Tax
Indemnitee shall repay to Lessee any amount  previously paid or advanced to such
Tax Indemnitee with respect to such claim,  plus interest at the rate that would
have been payable by the relevant Taxing Authority on a refund of such Tax.

     (c) Notwithstanding  anything in this ss. 9.3, a Tax Indemnitee will not be
required to contest the  imposition of any Tax, and shall be permitted to settle
or compromise  any claim without  Lessee's  consent,  if such Tax Indemnitee (1)
waives its right to  indemnity  under this ss. 9.3 with respect to such Tax (and
any  directly-related  claim,  and any claim the outcome of which is  determined
based upon the outcome of such claim),  (2) pays to Lessee any amount previously
paid or  advanced by Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3 with  respect to such Tax,
plus  interest at the rate that would have been payable by the  relevant  Taxing
Authority  on a refund of such Tax,  and (3) agrees to discuss  with  Lessee the
views  or  positions  of any  relevant  Taxing  Authority  with  respect  to the
imposition of such Tax provided,  that if Lessee has agreed in writing to settle
a claim for a stated amount and the relevant Tax Indemnitee settles the claim on
more favorable  terms,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall not be required to waive the
indemnity for such claim to the extent of the amount agreed to by Lessee.

     9.3.5 Refund

     If any Tax Indemnitee receives a refund of, or becomes entitled to a credit
against other liability for, all or any part of any Taxes paid,  reimbursed,  or
advanced by Lessee,  such Tax  Indemnitee  shall pay to Lessee within 30 days of
such  receipt an amount  equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of such refund or
credit plus any net tax benefit  (taking into account any Taxes incurred by such
Tax  Indemnitee by reason of the receipt of such refund or  realization  of such
credit)  actually  realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of any payment by
such Tax Indemnitee made pursuant to this sentence  (including this clause (a)),
and (b) such tax  payment,  reimbursement,  or  advance  by  Lessee  to such Tax
Indemnitee theretofore made pursuant to this ss. 9.3 (and the excess, if any, of
the amount described in clause (a) over the amount described in clause (b) shall
be carried forward and applied to reduce pro tanto any subsequent  obligation of
Lessee to make payments to such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this ss. 9.3). If, in
addition to such refund or credit,  such Tax Indemnitee receives (or is credited
with) an amount  representing  interest  on the amount of such refund or credit,
such Tax  Indemnitee  shall pay to  Lessee  within 30 days  after  receiving  or
realizing such credit the portion of such interest fairly  attributable to Taxes
paid,  reimbursed,  or advanced  by Lessee  before the receipt of such refund or
realization  of such credit.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a Tax Indemnitee
shall not be obligated to make any payment to Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 9.3.5
if a Special  Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  If
it is later  determined that such Tax Indemnitee was not entitled to such refund
or credit, the portion of the refund or credit repaid,  recaptured or disallowed
(and any  interest and tax savings  paid by such Tax  Indemnitee  to Lessee with
respect  thereto) shall be treated as Taxes for which Lessee must indemnify such
Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this ss. 9.3 without regard to ss. 9.3.2 hereof other
than ss. 9.3.2(f).

     9.3.6 Tax Filing

     Lessee shall timely file any report,  return, or statement that is required
to be filed with  respect to any Tax which is subject to  indemnification  under
this ss. 9.3 (except  for any such  report,  return,  or  statement  which a Tax
Indemnitee  has  timely  notified  Lessee in  writing  that such Tax  Indemnitee
intends to file, or for which such Tax Indemnitee is required by law to file, in
its own name);  provided,  that the relevant Tax Indemnitee shall furnish Lessee
with any  information  in such Tax  Indemnitee's  possession  or control that is
reasonably  necessary to file any such  return,  report,  or statement  and that
Lessee  reasonably  requests  in writing  (but the Tax  Indemnitee  shall not be
required  to  furnish  copies of its  actual  tax  returns,  although  it may be
required to furnish relevant information contained therein). Lessee shall either
file such report,  return,  or statement and send a copy to such Tax  Indemnitee
(and to Owner  Trustee,  if the Tax  Indemnitee  is not Owner  Trustee),  or, if
Lessee is not  permitted to file such report,  return,  or  statement,  it shall
notify such Tax  Indemnitee  of such  requirement  and prepare and deliver  such
report,  return,  or statement  to such Tax  Indemnitee  in a manner  reasonably
satisfactory  to such Tax  Indemnitee  within a reasonable  time before the time
such report, return, or statement is to be filed.

     9.3.7 Forms

     Each Tax Indemnitee  agrees to furnish from time to time to Lessee, or such
other Person as Lessee shall designate,  at Lessee's request, such duly-executed
and  properly-completed  forms as may be  necessary or  appropriate  in order to
claim any reduction of or exemption from any withholding or other Tax imposed by
any Taxing  Authority,  if (a) such  reduction or exemption is available to such
Tax  Indemnitee,  and (b)  Lessee  has  provided  such Tax  Indemnitee  with any
information  necessary to complete such form not otherwise  reasonably available
to such Tax Indemnitee.

     9.3.8 Non-Parties

     If a Tax  Indemnitee is not a party to this  Agreement,  Lessee may require
the Tax  Indemnitee  to agree in writing,  in a form  reasonably  acceptable  to
Lessee,  to the terms of this ss. 9.3 and ss. 15.8 before  making any payment to
such Tax Indemnitee under this ss. 9.3.

     9.4 Payments

     Any payments  made  pursuant to ss. 9.1 or ss. 9.3 shall be due on the 30th
day after demand,  and shall be made directly to the relevant  Indemnitee or Tax
Indemnitee or to Lessee, in immediately  available funds at such bank or to such
account  as  specified  by such  Indemnitee  or Tax  Indemnitee  or  Lessee  (as
applicable)  in written  directives to the payor,  or, if no such  direction has
been given,  by check of the payor  payable to the order of, and mailed to, such
Indemnitee  or Tax  Indemnitee  or Lessee (as  applicable)  by  certified  mail,
postage prepaid, at its address as set forth in this Agreement.

     9.5 Interest

     If any amount,  payable by Lessee,  any  Indemnitee,  or any Tax Indemnitee
under ss. 9.1 or ss. 9.3 is not paid when due, the Person obligated to make such
payment  shall pay on demand,  to the  extent  permitted  by Law,  to the Person
entitled thereto,  interest on any such amount for the period from and including
the due date for such amount to but  excluding  the date the amount is paid,  at
the Past-Due Rate.  Such interest shall be paid in the same manner as the unpaid
amount in respect of which such interest is due.

     9.6 Benefit of Indemnities

     Lessee's  obligations  for  indemnities,   obligations,   adjustments,  and
payments in ss. 9.1 or ss. 9.3 are expressly  made for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee  entitled  thereto,  without
declaring the Lease to be in default or taking other action thereunder.


     10. ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER OF INTERESTS

     10.1 Owner Participant and Owner Trustee

     10.1.1 Owner Participant

     (a) During the Term, Owner Participant shall not Transfer any or all of its

     (2) the Transferee  enters into a legal,  valid,  binding,  and enforceable

warranties substantially the same as those in ss. 6.2 of this Agreement;

     (3) upon such  Transfer  Lessee  shall not be  obligated to pay any greater
amount or incur  any  greater  obligation  than  that  which it would  have been
obliged to pay or incur under the Lease or other Lessee  Operative  Agreement if
no transfer or assignment had taken place,  and upon such Transfer the terms and
conditions  of the Lessee  Operative  Agreements  insofar as they  relate to the
rights and obligations of Lessee are not altered;

     (4) Owner  Participant shall deliver to Lessee and Owner Trustee an opinion
of  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to each of them to the  effect  that such

Code, the registration provisions of the Securities Act, or any other applicable
Federal law;

     (5) the Transfer  shall relate to Owner  Participant's  entire  interest as
Owner  Participant;  or, if it relates to less than its entire interest as Owner
Participant,  then (aa) Lessee shall have given its prior written consent to the
partial  Transfer,   and  (bb)  all  amendments  to  the  Operative  Agreements,
reasonably  requested  by Lessee or Owner  Participant,  that are  necessary  or
appropriate to accommodate the existence of multiple Owner  Participants,  shall
be agreed to and  executed  by the  parties  thereto,  all at the expense of the
Owner Participants under ss. 10.1.1(c);

     (6) the  Transferee  is a Citizen of the United  States  (such status to be
determined  without  considering  FAR ss. 47.9 or any other  provision  that may
restrict  Lessee's  use or  operation  of the  Aircraft),  or shall use a voting
powers  trust or similar  arrangement  in order to hold an interest in the Trust
Estate such that the Aircraft can be registered  in the United  States  (without
considering FAR ss. 47.9 or any other  provision that may restrict  Lessee's use
or operation of the Aircraft); and

     (7) the  Transferee  is a single  Person  and is  either  (aa) a  Permitted
Institution,   (bb)  or  an  Affiliate  of  a  Permitted  Institution,  if  such
Affiliate's obligations under the Owner Participant Agreements are guaranteed by
such Permitted Institution pursuant to a written guaranty,  substantially in the
form of  Exhibit  J  hereto  (or  otherwise  in form  and  substance  reasonably
satisfactory to Lessee and Owner  Trustee),  or (cc) with Lessee's prior written
consent,  any other Person the  obligations of whom under the Owner  Participant
Agreements  are  guaranteed  by a  Permitted  Institution  pursuant to a written
guaranty,  in form and  substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to Lessee and Owner
Trustee.

     (b) Owner Participant shall give written notice to Lessee and Owner Trustee
at least 10 days before any such  Transfer,  specifying  the name and address of
the proposed  Transferee,  and  providing  financial  statements of the proposed
Transferee or guarantor evidencing satisfaction of the requirements described in
ss. 10.1.1(a)(7)(aa) or (bb).

     (c) Any reasonable fees,  charges,  and expenses,  including the reasonable
legal fees,  charges,  and expenses incurred by Lessee,  Owner  Participant,  or
Owner Trustee in connection with any Transfer by Owner Participant  permitted by
this ss.  10.1.1,  or by the  Transferee  in any such case,  will be paid for by
Owner Participant.

     10.1.2 Owner Trustee

     Owner Trustee may transfer its interests in the Trust Agreement pursuant to
ss. 9 thereof.

     10.2 Effect of Transfer

     Upon  any  Transfer  in  accordance  with ss.  10.1.1  or ss.  10.1.2,  the
Transferee shall be deemed "Owner Participant" or "Owner Trustee", respectively,
for all purposes of the Operative Agreements and, in the case of a Transferee of
Owner Participant,  shall be deemed to have paid its ratable portion of Lessor's
Cost  previously  made  by  Owner   Participant,   making  such  conveyance  and
represented by the interest being conveyed,  and each reference  herein to Owner
Participant  or Owner  Trustee  shall  thereafter  be deemed a reference to such
Transferee for all purposes,  and the  transferring  Owner  Participant or Owner
Trustee  shall be released  (including,  in the case of Owner  Participant,  any
Guarantor  with respect to any guaranty  provided by it under ss.  10.1.1(a)(7))
from all of its liabilities and  obligations  under the Operative  Agreements to
the extent such  liabilities and  obligations  arise after such Transfer and, in
each case, to the extent such  liabilities  and  obligations  are assumed by the
Transferee; provided, that such transferring Owner Participant, or Owner Trustee
will  continue  to have the  benefit  of any  rights  or  indemnities  under any
Operative  Agreement vested or relating to circumstances,  conditions,  acts, or
events before such Transfer.

     11. SECTION 1110

     Lessee, Owner Participant,  and Owner Trustee intend that Owner Trustee, as
lessor under the Lease, shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 in the
event of a case under  Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code in which  Lessee is a
debtor.

     12. CHANGE OF CITIZENSHIP

     12.1 Generally

     Without prejudice to the  representations,  warranties,  or covenants as to
any party's status as a Citizen of the United States:

     (a) Lessee and FSB agree that,  immediately upon obtaining knowledge of any
facts  that would  cast  doubt  upon its  continuing  status as a Citizen of the
United States, and promptly upon public disclosure of negotiations in respect of
any  transaction  which would or might  adversely  affect such  status,  it will
notify all parties hereto of all relevant matters in connection therewith; and

     (b)  Owner  Participant  agrees  that,  if its  status  is to change or has
changed as a Citizen of the United  States,  or it makes  public  disclosure  of
circumstances  as a result of which it  believes  that such  status is likely to
change, it will notify all the other parties to this Participation  Agreement of
(1) such change in status promptly after obtaining Actual Knowledge thereof, and
(2) such belief as soon as practicable  after such public disclosure (but in any
event within 10 Business Days after such public disclosure).

     12.2 Owner Participant

     Owner Participant  agrees,  solely for the benefit of Lessee, that if, when
the Aircraft is registered in the United States, (a) Owner Participant is not be
a  Citizen  of the  United  States,  and (b) the  Aircraft  shall  be,  or would
therefore become, ineligible for registration in the name of Owner Trustee under
the  Transportation  Code and regulations  then applicable  thereunder  (without
considering  FAR ss. 47.9 or any other  provision that may restrict  Lessee's or
any  Permitted  Sublessee's  use or  operation  of  the  Aircraft),  then  Owner
Participant shall as soon as is reasonably  practicable (but in any event within
30 days after obtaining Actual Knowledge of such  ineligibility and of such loss
of citizenship), (y) effect voting trust or other similar arrangements (in which
case any  provisions  contained in the Operative  Agreements  restricting  Owner
Participant's or Owner Trustee's  ability to amend the Trust Agreement shall not
apply to the extent  necessary to permit the use of such a voting trust or other
similar  arrangement)  or  take  any  other  action  necessary  to  prevent  any
deregistration  or maintain the United States  registration of the Aircraft,  or
(z)  transfer  in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement  all its right,
title,  and interest in and to this Agreement,  the Trust Estate,  and the Trust
Agreement in accordance with ss. 10.1.

     12.3 Owner Trustee

     Upon FSB's giving any notice in accordance with ss. 12.1(a),  Owner Trustee
shall,  subject to ss. 9.1.1 of the Trust  Agreement,  resign as Owner  Trustee.
Upon  its  receipt  of such  notice,  Owner  Participant  shall as  promptly  as
practicable  appoint a Citizen of the United  States as successor  Owner Trustee
pursuant to ss. 9.1 of the Trust Agreement.

     13. CONCERNING OWNER TRUSTEE

     Except as otherwise  expressly  provided herein, or in the Trust Agreement,
Owner Trustee is entering into this Agreement  solely in its capacity as trustee
as provided in the Trust Agreement and not in its individual capacity, and in no
case whatsoever will it be liable or accountable in its individual  capacity for
any of the statements,  representations,  warranties, agreements, or obligations
of Owner Trustee  hereunder,  or for any loss in respect  thereof,  as to all of
which the  parties  agree to look  solely to the Trust  Estate;  provided,  that
nothing in this ss. 13 shall limit in scope or substance the personal  liability
of FSB (a) to Owner  Participant as expressly set forth in the Trust  Agreement,
(b) in  respect  of  the  representations,  warranties,  and  agreements  of FSB
expressly made as such herein or in any other Operative Agreement to which it is
a party,  and (c) for the  consequences  of its own  gross  negligence,  willful
misconduct, and, in receiving,  handling or remitting of funds only, its willful
misconduct or simple negligence as a trustee.

     14. MISCELLANEOUS

     14.1 Amendments

     No  provision  of this  Agreement  may be  amended,  supplemented,  waived,
modified,  discharged,  terminated,  or otherwise varied orally,  but only by an
instrument  in  writing  that  specifically  identifies  the  provision  of this
Agreement  that it  purports to amend,  supplement,  waive,  modify,  discharge,
terminate,  or  otherwise  vary and is  signed  by the  party  against  whom the
enforcement  of the  amendment,  supplement,  waiver,  modification,  discharge,
termination,  or variance is sought.  Each such amendment,  supplement,  waiver,
modification, discharge, termination, or variance shall be effective only in the
specific  instance  and for the  specific  purpose  for  which it is  given.  No
provision  of  this  Agreement   shall  be  varied  or   contradicted   by  oral
communication,  course of dealing or performance,  or other manner not set forth
in  writing  and signed by the party  against  whom  enforcement  of the same is
sought.

     14.2 Severability

     If  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  is  held  invalid,   illegal,   or
unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction,  then, to the extent permitted
by Law, (a) all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in
such  jurisdiction,  and (b) such invalidity,  illegality,  or  unenforceability
shall not affect the validity,  legality, or enforceability of such provision in
any other jurisdiction.  If, however,  any Law pursuant to which such provisions
are held invalid,  illegal,  or unenforceable may be waived,  the parties hereto
hereby  waive  that  Law to the full  extent  permitted,  to the end  that  this
Agreement shall be a valid and binding agreement in all respects, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

     14.3 Survival

     The  indemnities in this Agreement  shall survive the delivery or return of
the  Aircraft,  the  Transfer  of any  interest  of  Owner  Participant  in this
Agreement,  the Trust Estate,  and the Trust  Agreement,  and the  expiration or
other  termination of any Operative  Agreement,  except to the extent  otherwise
provided therein.

     14.4 Reproduction of Documents

     This Agreement (including all annexes,  schedules, and exhibits hereto) and
all documents  relating  hereto,  including (a) future  consents,  waivers,  and
modifications,  and (b) past and future financial statements,  certificates, and
other  information  furnished  to any party  hereto,  may be  reproduced  by any
photographic,  photostatic,  microfilm,  micro-card,  miniature photographic, or
other  similar  process,  and any party may destroy any  original  documents  so
reproduced.  Any such  reproduction  shall be as  admissible  in evidence as the
original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the
original  exists and  whether or not such  party  made the  reproduction  in the
regular  course  of  business),  and  any  enlargement,  facsimile,  or  further
reproduction of such reproduction also shall be so admissible in evidence.

     14.5 Counterparts

     This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents, or supplements hereto
may be executed in any number of counterparts (or upon separate  signature pages
bound together into one or more counterparts),  each fully-executed set of which
shall be deemed to be an original.

     14.6 No Waiver

     No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay by any
party hereto in exercising,  any of its rights, powers,  remedies, or privileges
under this Agreement or otherwise  available shall impair,  prejudice,  or waive
any such right,  power,  remedy, or privilege or be construed as a waiver of any
breach hereof or default hereunder or as an acquiescence  therein, nor shall any
single or partial  exercise  of any such  right,  power,  remedy,  or  privilege
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof by it or the  exercise  of any
other right,  power,  remedy,  or privilege by it. No notice to or demand on any
party hereto in any case shall,  unless otherwise required under this Agreement,
entitle such party to any other or further  notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances,  or waive the rights of any party  hereto to any other or further
action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

     14.7 Notices

         Unless otherwise  expressly permitted by the terms hereof, all notices,
requests,  demands,  authorizations,  directions,  consents,  waivers, and other
communications  required or permitted  to be made,  given,  furnished,  or filed
hereunder  shall be in writing  (and the  specification  of a writing in certain
instances  and not in others does not imply an  intention  that a writing is not
required as to the latter),  shall refer  specifically  to this  Agreement,  and
shall be personally  delivered,  sent by fax or  telecommunication  transmission
(which  in  either  case  provides  written  confirmation  to the  sender of its
delivery),  sent by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested,
or sent by next-business-day courier service, in each case to the address or fax
number  set forth for such  party in  Schedule  1, or to such  other  address or
number as such party hereafter  specifies by notice to the other parties hereto.
Each such notice, request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver, or
other  communication  shall be  effective  when  received  or,  if made,  given,
furnished, or filed by fax or telecommunication transmission, when confirmed.

     14.8 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue

accordance  with the laws of the state of New York,  including  all  matters  of

     (b) Each party  hereto  hereby  irrevocably  agrees,  accepts,  and submits
itself to the non-exclusive  jurisdiction of the courts of the state of New York
in the city and  county of New York and of the United  States  for the  Southern
District of New York, in connection  with any legal action,  suit, or proceeding
with respect to any matter  relating to or arising out of or in connection  with
the Operative Agreements.

     (c) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably consents and agrees to the service
of any and all legal  process,  summons,  notices,  and  documents of any of the
aforementioned  courts in any such suit,  action,  or proceeding  may be made by
delivering copies thereof by registered or certified mail,  postage prepaid,  at
the address set forth pursuant to ss. 14.7. Each party hereto hereby agrees that
service upon it, or any of its agents,  in each case in accordance with this ss.
14.8(c),  shall constitute valid and effective personal service upon such party,
and each party  hereto  hereby  agrees  that the failure of any of its agents to
give any notice of such  service to any such party shall not impair or affect in
any way the validity of such  service on such party or any judgment  rendered in
any action or proceeding based thereon.

     (d) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable  law, and agrees not to assert,  by way of motion,  as a defense,  or
otherwise,  in any legal action or  proceeding  brought  hereunder in any of the
above-named courts, that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum,  that  venue  for the  action  or  proceeding  is  improper,  or that any
Operative Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts.

         (e) Each party  hereto  hereby  waives its right to a jury trial of any
claim or cause of action in any court in any jurisdiction  based upon or arising
out of or relating to the Operative Agreements.

     14.9 Third-Party Beneficiary

     This  Agreement  is not  intended to provide  (and shall not  provide)  any
Person not a party hereto with any rights of any nature  whatsoever  against any
of the parties  hereto,  and no Person not a party  hereto shall have any right,
power,  or  privilege  in respect of any party  hereto,  or have any  benefit or
interest, arising out of this Agreement.

     14.10 Entire Agreement

     This Agreement,  together with the other Operative Agreements, on and as of
the date hereof,  constitutes  the entire  agreement of the parties  hereto with
respect  to  the  subject  matter  hereof,  and  all  prior   understandings  or
agreements,  whether  written  or oral,  among any of the  parties  hereto  with
respect to such subject matter are hereby superseded in their entireties.

     14.11 Further Assurances

     Each party hereto shall execute,  acknowledge,  and deliver (or cause to be
executed, acknowledged, and delivered) all such further agreements, instruments,
certificates, or other documents, and shall do and cause to be done such further
things,  as any other party hereto  reasonably  requests in connection  with the

assure and  confirm  better to such other  party the rights and  benefits  to be
provided under, this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements.

         This Lease  Agreement  N___AT (this  "LEASE")  dated as of  __________,
200_, between (1) First Security Bank, National Association,  a national banking
association,  not in its  individual  capacity  (except  as  expressly  provided
herein) but solely as Owner Trustee ("LESSOR"), and (2) American Trans Air, Inc.
("LESSEE"), an Indiana corporation.

         Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:

                         1. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

         The terms defined in Annex A, when  capitalized as in Annex A, have the

                           2. DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

         2.1               DELIVERY AND LEASE OF AIRCRAFT

         Lessor  hereby  leases the Aircraft to Lessee for the Term,  and Lessee
hereby leases the Aircraft from Lessor for the Term.

         2.2               ACCEPTANCE BY LESSEE

         Lessee hereby  confirms to Lessor that Lessee has duly and  irrevocably
accepted delivery of the Aircraft for all purposes of this Lease.

                                3. TERM AND RENT

         3.1               TERM

         The Aircraft shall be leased hereunder for the Term,  unless this Lease

         3.2               RENT

     3.2.1 BASIC RENT; ADJUSTMENTS TO BASIC RENT AND CERTAIN OTHER AMOUNTS

         (a)......During  the Base Term,  Lessee  shall pay to  Lessor,  on each
Payment Date,  Basic Rent in the amount equal to the percentage of Lessor's Cost
specified  in  Schedule 2 for such  Payment  Date.  The  amounts  and periods of
Lessee's  liability  for Basic Rent shall be as  allocated  in  accordance  with
Schedule 2A. Such Basic Rent payments and such allocations shall be (i) adjusted
pursuant to ss.  3.2.1(b),  or (ii) increased in an amounT equal to any increase
in the amount of interest due on the  Equipment  Notes on the  relevant  Payment
Date pursuant to ss. 2(e) of the Registration  Rights Agreement (or,  subsequent
to any such increase,  decreased by the amount oF such increase  pursuant to ss.
2(e) of the  Registration  Rights  Agreement).  During any Renewal Term,  Lessee
shall paY to Lessor,  on each Payment Date, Basic Rent equal to the Renewal Rent
for that Renewal Term, determined pursuant to ss. 17.2.2.

         (b)......Basic  Rent, Basic Rent  allocations,  Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values, and EBO Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

                  (1) If Transaction Expenses paid by Lessor pursuant to ss. 9.2
         of the ParticipatioN  Agreement are determined to be other than 2.0% of
         Lessor's Cost, then the Basic Rent percentages in Schedule 2, the Basic
         Rent allocations in Schedule 2A, the Stipulated Loss Value  percentages
         in Schedule 3, the Termination Value percentages in Schedule 4, and the
         EBO  Price  shall  be  recalculated  (upwards  or  downwards)  by Owner
         Participant,  on or before the 120th day after the Delivery  Date using
         the same methods and assumptions used to calculate original Basic Rent,
         EBO Price, Stipulated Loss Value, and Termination Value percentages, in
         order (aa) to maintain Owner  Participant's  Net Economic  Return,  and
         (bb) to the extent  possible  consistent  with  clause (aa) of this ss.
         3.2.1(b)(1), to minimizE the Net Present Value of Rents to Lessee.

                  (2) In the event of a refinancing as contemplated by ss. 11 of
         the  ParticipatioN  Agreement,  then  the  Basic  Rent  percentages  in
         Schedule 2, the Basic Rent  allocations  in Schedule 2A, the Stipulated
         Loss Value percentages in Schedule 3, the Termination Value percentages
         in  Schedule  4,  and the EBO  Price  shall  be  adjusted  (upwards  or
         downwards)  by Owner  Participant  as  contemplated  by such ss.  11 to
         reflect  the  change,  if any, in  interest  rate  resulting  from such
         refinancing, in order (aa) to maintain Owner Participant's Net Economic
         Return, and (bb) to the extent possible  consistent with clause (aa) of
         this ss.  3.2.1(b)(2),  to minimize  the Net Present  Value of Rents to
         Lessee.

                  (3)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in no event  shall  any
         adjustment  to the EBO  Price be made  such  that the EBO Price is less
         than the greatest of (aa) the adjusted  Stipulated Loss Value as of the
         EBO Date,  (bb) the estimated  fair market value of the Aircraft on the
         EBO Date as set forth in the Appraisal  referred to in ss.  5.1.2(m) of
         the Participation  Agreement, and (cc) the sum of the presenT values of
         (i) Basic Rent payable, as adjusted, during the Base Term after the EBO
         Date,  and (ii) the appraised  fair market value of the Aircraft at the
         end of the Base Term as estimated in the  Appraisal  referred to in ss.
         5.1.2(m) of the  Participation  Agreement,  each discounted back to the
         EBO Date (using A discount rate of 16.5%).

         (c) All adjustments  pursuant to ss. 3.2.1(b) shall be made as promptly
as  practicable  after  eitheR Owner  Participant  or Lessee gives notice to the
other that an event has occurred that requires an adjustment.  Owner Participant
and  Lessee  shall give  prompt  notice to the other of any event  requiring  an
adjustment.  Any recalculation of the percentages of Basic Rent payments,  Basic
Rent allocations,  Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value, and EBO Price shall
be  prepared by Owner  Participant,  subject to  verification  at the request of
Lessee  in  accordance  with  this  ss.  3.2.1(c),  on the  basis  of  the  same
methodology  and  assumptions  used by  OwneR  Participant  in  determining  the
percentages of Basic Rent,  Stipulated Loss Value,  Termination  Value,  and EBO
Price as of the Delivery Date,  except as such assumptions have been modified to
reflect the events giving rise to adjustments  hereunder and taking into account
the law applicable at the time of such adjustment.  Promptly after an adjustment
is made hereunder,  Owner  Participant  shall deliver to Lessee a description of
such adjustment, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation thereof. All
adjustments (1) shall be made so as to avoid  characterization of the Lease as a
"disqualified  leaseback or long-term  agreement" within the meaning of Code ss.
467 and Treasury Regulations thereunder, and (2) shall be in compliance with the
requirements  of ss.  4(1) And ss.  4(6) of Revenue  Procedure  75-21 and ss.ss.
4.02(5),  4.07(l),  and 4.07(2) of Revenue Procedure 75-28, except tO the extent
that on the Delivery  Date the Lease  constituted a  "disqualified  leaseback or
long-term  agreement"  or was  not in  compliance  with  the  Revenue  Procedure
sections  referred to in clause (2). In connection with any such  adjustments to
payments and allocations of Basic Rent,  appropriate  corresponding  adjustments
shall be made to the  percentages  set forth on Schedules 3 and 4 in the columns
headed "Deferred Basic Rent Amount" and "Prepaid Basic Rent Amount".  All of the
foregoing  adjustments  shall be set forth in an  amendment  to this Lease,  and
promptly after execution thereof by Lessor and Lessee,  Lessee shall give a copy
thereof to Mortgagee.

         (d) If  Lessee  believes  that any  calculations  by Owner  Participant
pursuant to ss. 3.2.1(c) are iN error,  and if, after  consultation,  Lessee and
Owner  Participant do not agree on an adjustment,  then a  nationally-recognized
firm of  accountants  selected by Lessee and  reasonably  satisfactory  to Owner
Participant  shall  verify  such  calculations.   Owner  Participant  will  make
available to such firm (but not to Lessee or any  representative  of Lessee) the
methodology  and assumptions  referred to in ss. 3.2.1(c) and any  modifications
theretO made to reflect the events giving rise to adjustments hereunder (subject
to the  execution  by  such  firm  of a  confidentiality  agreement,  reasonably
acceptable to Owner Participant,  prohibiting disclosure of such methodology and
assumptions to any third party).  The  determination by such firm of accountants
shall be  final.  Lessee  will pay the  reasonable  costs and  expenses  of such
verification by such accountants, except that if it results in (1) a decrease in
Basic Rent which  decreases  the  remaining Net Present Value of Rents by ten or
more basis points from the remaining Net Present Value of Rents as  recalculated
by Owner  Participant,  or (2) a material  reduction in Stipulated  Loss Values,
Termination Values, or the EBO Price, then Owner Participant will pay such costs
and expenses.

         (e)   Notwithstanding   anything  to  the  contrary  in  any  Operative
Agreement,  the  amount of the  payment  of Basic  Rent due and  payable on each
Payment  Date shall be at least  sufficient  to pay in full,  as of such Payment
Date  (assuming  timely  payment of the Equipment  Notes before such Date),  the
aggregate principal amount of scheduled  installments due on the Equipment Notes
outstanding on such Payment Date,  together with the accrued and unpaid interest
thereon,  due on such Payment Date in respect of the Equipment Notes;  PROVIDED,
that no installment of Basic Rent shall be increased to the extent such increase
would be based upon (1) any  attachment or diversion of Basic Rent on account of
Lessor Liens,  (2) any modification of the payment terms of the Equipment Notes,
other than as required or permitted by any  Operative  Agreement  (including  as
permitted  upon  the  occurrence  of a  Lease  Event  of  Default),  or (3)  the
acceleration of any Equipment  Note(s) due solely to the existence of a Mortgage
Event of Default that does not constitute a Lease Event of Default.

                           3.2.2            SUPPLEMENTAL RENT

         Lessee  shall pay to Lessor,  or to whomever is entitled to it, any and
all Supplemental Rent when and as it becomes due and owing. Lessee will also pay
to Lessor, or to whomever is entitled to it, as Supplemental Rent, to the extent
permitted by  applicable  Law,  interest at the Past-Due Rate on any part of any
amount of Rent  (including  Supplemental  Rent) not paid by 11:00 a.m., New York
time, on the date when due (so long as, in the case of any Person not a party to
the Participation Agreement, Lessee had received timely notice of the account to
which such payment was required to be made),  for the period from and  including
the date on which the same was due to (but  excluding)  the date of  payment  in
full.

         3.3               PAYMENTS

         (a)  Payments  of Rent by  Lessee  shall  be paid by wire  transfer  of
immediately available Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the date when due,  to the  account  of Lessor  specified  in  Schedule 1 to the
Participation Agreement (or to such other account in the United States as Lessor
specifies to Lessee in writing at least 10 Business  Days before such payment of
Rent is due),  or, in the case of any  payment of  Supplemental  Rent  expressly
payable to a Person  other than  Lessor,  to the Person  that shall be  entitled
thereto, to such account in the United States as such Person specifies from time
to time to Lessee at least 10 Business Days before such payment of Rent is due.

         (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment
of Rent shall be due on a day that is not a Business  Day, such payment shall be
made on the next day that is a Business  Day,  and,  if such  payment is made on
such next Business  Day, no interest  shall accrue on the amount of such payment
during such extension.

         (c) So  long as  Lessee  has  not  received  written  notice  from  the
Mortgagee that the Lien of the Mortgage has been discharged, and notwithstanding
ss. 3.3(a),  Lessor hereby directs, and Lessee agrees, that alL payments of Rent
payable by Lessee,  other than  Excluded  Payments,  shall be paid  directly  to
Mortgagee on behalf of Lessor by wire transfer of immediately  available Dollars
to the  account  of  Mortgagee  specified  in  Schedule  1 to the  Participation
Agreement (or to such other account in the United States as Mortgagee  specifies
by written  notice to Lessor and Lessee at least 10  Business  Days  before such
payment of Rent is due).

         (d)  Excluded  Payments  payable  to any  Person  shall be paid by wire
transfer  of  immediately  available  Dollars  to the  account  of  such  Person
specified  in the  Participation  Agreement  or,  if not so  specified,  to such
account in the United States such Person  specifies by written  notice to Lessor
and Lessee  from time to time at least 10 Business  Days before such  payment is
required to be made.

         (e) All  computations of interest under this Lease shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days composed of twelve 30-day months.

         13.2              MERGER OF LESSEE

circumstances  in which  Lessee is not the  surviving  corporation,  or  convey,
transfer,  or lease in one or more  transactions all or substantially all of its

observance of each covenant,  agreement,  and condition in the Lessee  Operative
Agreements to be performed or observed by Lessee;

     (c) such Person makes such filings and recordings  with the FAA pursuant to
the Transportation  Code as shall be necessary to evidence such consolidation or
merger;

         (d) Lessee furnishes Lessor and Owner Participant an opinion of counsel

merger items (a), (b) and (c) above;

     (e) immediately  after giving effect to such  consolidation  or merger,  no
Special Default or Lease Event of Default exists;

     (f) unless Owner Participant  otherwise consents,  immediately after giving
effect to such  consolidation  or merger,  such Person will have a tangible  net
worth  of at least  the  lesser  of (i)  100% of  Lessee's  tangible  net  worth

under the Lessee Operative Agreements with the same effect as if such Person had
been named as  "Lessee"  therein.  No such  consolidation,  merger,  conveyance,
transfer, or lease shall have the effect of releasing Lessee or such Person from
any of Lessee's obligations,  liabilities,  covenants, or undertakings under the

right,  title,  and  interest in and to this Lease  pursuant to the terms of the
Mortgage.  In  accordance  with ss.  3.3(c),  Lessee  agreeS to pay  directly to
Mortgagee (or, after receipt by Lessee of notice from Mortgagee of the discharge
of the Lien of the  Mortgage,  to  Lessor),  all  amounts  of Rent  (other  than

absolute  and  unconditional  and shall  not be  affected  by any  circumstance,
including  the  circumstances  set forth in ss. 16 hereof.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing  assignment of this Lease,  Lessee's  obligations to Lessor to perform
the terms and conditions of this Lease shall remain in full force and effect.

rights,  powers,  and  title of  Lessor  hereunder,  and  shall be  deemed to be
"Lessor"  and the owner of the Aircraft and the other assets of the Trust Estate
for all purposes hereof,  without the need for any consent or approval by Lessee
and without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or Lessee's  obligations
hereunder.  An appointment and designation of a successor as Owner Trustee shall
not exhaust the right to appoint and designate further  successors or additional
trustees as Owner Trustees pursuant to the Participation Agreement and the Trust
Agreement,  and such  right may be  exercised  repeatedly  as long as this Lease
shall be in effect.

Operative  Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.  Each and
every  right,  power,  remedy,  and  privilege  hereby given to, or retained by,
Lessor in this Lease  shall be in  addition  to and not in  limitation  of every
other right, power,  remedy, and privilege given under the Operative  Agreements

remedy,  and  privilege  of Lessor  under  this  Lease  and any other  Operative
Agreement may be exercised from time to time or simultaneously  and as often and
in such order as may be deemed  expedient by Lessor.  All such  rights,  powers,
remedies, and privileges shall be cumulative and not mutually exclusive, and the
exercise of one shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other.
Lessee hereby waives to the extent  permitted by applicable  Law any right which
it may have to require Lessor to choose or elect remedies.

         Lessee and Lessor  acknowledge that at Lessee's  election the EBO Price

agree  that  if  Lessee  elects  to  purchase  the  Aircraft   pursuant  to  ss.

         17.4              APPRAISALS

         Whenever  Fair Market  Rental  Value or Fair Market  Sales Value of the
Aircraft is required to be determined by an appraisal  under this ss. 17, Lessee
and Lessor  shall  appoint a  mutually-satisfactory  Appraiser  tO conduct  such
appraisal.  If Lessee and Lessor  fail to agree upon a  satisfactory  Appraiser,
then each shall promptly appoint a separate Appraiser, and such Appraisers shall
jointly determine such amount. If either Lessee or Lessor does not so appoint an
Appraiser,  the determination of the single Appraiser  appointed shall be final.
If two Appraisers  are appointed and within seven days after the  appointment of
the latter of such two Appraisers,  they do not agree upon such amount, such two
Appraisers  shall,  within eight days after such latter  appointment,  appoint a
third Appraiser,  and such amount shall be determined by such three  Appraisers,
who shall  make their  separate  appraisals  within  seven  days  following  the
appointment  of the third  Appraiser,  and any  determination  so made  shall be
conclusive  and binding  upon Lessor and Lessee.  If no such third  Appraiser is
appointed within such eight-day period, either Lessor or Lessee may apply to the
American  Arbitration  Association  to make such  appointment,  and both parties
shall be bound by such appointment.  The foregoing  appraisal procedure shall in
any event be  completed no less than 125 days before the end of the Base Term or
any Renewal Term (unless such procedure is undertaken in connection  with ss. 15
or ss.  17.3.1(a),  in  which  case it shall be  completed  promptlY).  If three
Appraisers are appointed and the difference  between the determination  which is
further from the middle  determination and the middle determination is more than
125%  of  the  difference  between  the  middle   determination  and  the  third
determination,  then such further determination shall be excluded, the remaining
two  determinations  shall be  averaged,  and such  average  shall be final  and
binding   upon  Lessor  and  Lessee.   Otherwise,   the  average  of  all  three
determinations  shall be final and binding upon Lessor and Lessee.  The fees and
expenses of all such  Appraisers  and such  appraisal  procedure  shall be borne
equally by Lessee and Lessor.

                                18. MISCELLANEOUS

                                   MAINTENANCE

         The  terms  defined  in  Annex  A  to  Lease  Agreement  N___AT,   when
capitalized   as  in  Annex  A,  have  the  same  meanings  when  used  in  this
"Maintenance"  Annex.  Annex  A  also  contains  rules  of  usage  that  control
construction in this "Maintenance" Annex.

         A.       MAINTENANCE.
                  -----------

         Lessee shall maintain,  service,  repair, and overhaul the Aircraft (or
cause the Aircraft to be  maintained,  serviced,  repaired,  and  overhauled) in
accordance  with  (1)  maintenance   standards  required  by,  or  substantially
equivalent to those required by, the FAA or the central civil aviation authority
of Canada, Japan, and the JAA for the Aircraft (the "MAINTENANCE  PROGRAM"),  so
as (aa) to keep  the  Aircraft  in as good  operating  condition  as  originally
delivered  hereunder,  ordinary  wear  and tear  excepted,  and (bb) to keep the
Aircraft  in  such  operating  condition  as  may be  necessary  to  enable  the
applicable airworthiness certificate for the Aircraft to be maintained under the
regulations of the FAA or other Aviation Authority then having jurisdiction over
the  operation  of the  Aircraft,  other than  during (x)  temporary  periods of
storage  in  accordance  with  applicable   regulations,   (y)  maintenance  and
modification  permitted  hereunder,  and (z) periods  when the FAA or such other
Aviation  Authority has revoked or suspended the airworthiness  certificates for
Similar Aircraft;  and (2) except during periods when a Permitted Sublease is in
effect,  the same  standards as Lessee uses with respect to similar  aircraft of
similar  size in its fleet  operated  by Lessee in  similar  circumstances  and,
during any period in which a Permitted Sublease is in effect, the same standards
used by the Permitted Sublessee with respect to similar aircraft of similar size
in its fleet and operated by the Permitted  Sublessee in similar  circumstances.
Lessee  further  agrees that the Aircraft will be  maintained,  used,  serviced,
repaired,  overhauled,  or inspected in  compliance  with  applicable  Laws with
respect  to  the  maintenance  of  the  Aircraft  and in  compliance  with  each
applicable airworthiness certificate,  license, and registration relating to the
Aircraft  issued by the  Aviation  Authority,  other than minor or  nonrecurring
violations  with respect to which  corrective  measures are taken upon discovery
thereof and except to the extent Lessee or Permitted  Sublessee is contesting in
good faith the validity or application  of any such Law or requirement  relating
to any such certificate, license, or registration in any reasonable manner which
does not create a material  risk of sale,  loss,  or forfeiture of the Aircraft,
the  Airframe,  or any Engine or the  interest of any  Participant  therein or a
material risk of criminal  liability or material civil penalty  against  Lessor,
Owner Participant, or Mortgagee. Lessee shall cause the Aircraft Documents to be
maintained in English and promptly  furnish  Lessor and Owner  Participant  with
information   necessary  for  filing  with  applicable   governmental   aviation
authorities.

         B.       REPLACEMENT OF PARTS.
                  --------------------

         Except as otherwise  provided herein,  Lessee will promptly replace (or
cause to be  replaced)  all  Parts  that are from time to time  incorporated  or
installed  in or attached  to the  Aircraft,  and that  become  worn out,  lost,
stolen, destroyed,  seized,  confiscated,  damaged beyond repair, or permanently
rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, Lessee may remove
(or  permit to be  removed)  any Parts in the  ordinary  course of  maintenance,
service,  repair,  overhaul, or testing, whether or not such Parts are worn out,
lost,  stolen,  destroyed,  seized,  confiscated,   damaged  beyond  repair,  or
permanently rendered unfit for use; PROVIDED, that, except as otherwise provided
herein,  Lessee will replace or cause the  replacement of such Parts as promptly
as  practicable.  All  replacement  Parts  shall be free and clear of all Liens,
except for Permitted Liens and pooling  arrangements to the extent  permitted by
ss. C below and shall be in good operating  condition and (except in thE case of
replacement  property  installed on the basis of operational  exigencies) have a
value and  utility  not less than the value and  utility  of the Parts  replaced
(assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition  required under this Lease).
Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  all Parts at any time  removed from the
Aircraft  shall remain the property of Lessor,  no matter where  located,  until
they are  replaced  by Parts  that have been  incorporated  or  installed  in or
attached to the Aircraft and that meet the  requirements  for replacement  Parts
specified  above. As soon as a replacement  Part is incorporated or installed in
or attached to the Aircraft as above provided, without further act, (1) title to
the  replaced  Part shall vest in Lessee (or if a Permitted  Sublease is then in
effect,  in the Permitted  Sublessee) free and clear of all Lessor Liens and all
rights  of  Lessor,  and the  replaced  Part  shall no  longer  be deemed a Part
hereunder, (2) title to such replacement Part shall vest in Lessor, subject only
to Permitted  Liens and pooling  arrangements  to the extent  permitted by ss. C
below and except in the case of replacement property temporarily installed on an
emergency  basis,  and (3) such  replacement  Part shall become  subject to this
Lease and the  Mortgage  and be deemed  part of the  Aircraft  for all  purposes
hereof and thereof to the same extent as the Parts  originally  incorporated  or
installed in or attached to such Aircraft.

         C.       POOLING OF PARTS.
                  ----------------

         Any Part  removed  from the  Aircraft  may be  subjected by Lessee or a
Permitted  Sublessee to a normal  pooling  arrangement  customary in the airline
industry and entered  into in the ordinary  course of business of Lessee or such
Permitted  Sublessee,  so long as a Part  replacing  such  removed Part shall be
incorporated  or installed in or attached to the Aircraft in accordance with ss.
B of this Annex C as promptly as  practicable  afteR the removal of such removed
Part. In addition,  any  replacement  Part when  incorporated or installed in or
attached  to the  Aircraft  may be owned by any third  party  subject  to such a
normal  pooling  arrangement,  so long as  Lessee  or  Permitted  Sublessee,  as
promptly  thereafter  as  reasonably  possible,  either (1) causes title to such
replacement  Part to vest in Lessor in  accordance  with ss. B of this  Annex C,
free and clear of all Liens (excepT Permitted Liens), or (2) replaces (or causes
to be replaced)  such  replacement  Part by  incorporating  or  installing in or
attaching  to the  Aircraft  a  further  replacement  Part  owned by Lessee or a
Permitted  Sublessee free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens) and by
causing title to such further  replacement  Part to vest in Lessor in accordance
with ss. B of this Annex C.

         D.       ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS, AND ADDITIONS.
                  -----------------------------------------

         Lessee  shall  make  (or  cause  to  be  made)  such   alterations  and
modifications  in and  additions to the Aircraft as may be required from time to
time to meet the  applicable  standards of the FAA or other  Aviation  Authority
having  jurisdiction  over the  operation  of the  Aircraft,  to the extent made
mandatory in respect of the  Aircraft (a  "MANDATORY  MODIFICATION");  PROVIDED,
that Lessee or any  Permitted  Sublessee  may, in good faith and by  appropriate
procedure,  contest the validity or application of any law, rule, regulation, or
order in any  reasonable  manner which does not have more than a DE MINIMIS risk
of adversely  affecting  Lessor's  interest in the Aircraft (and, so long as any
Equipment Notes are outstanding, the Mortgagee) and does not involve more than a
DE MINIMIS risk of sale, forfeiture,  or loss of the Aircraft or the interest of
any Participant therein,  more than a DE MINIMIS risk of material civil penalty,
or any risk of criminal  liability being imposed on Lessor,  Owner  Participant,
Mortgagee, or the holder of any Equipment Note. In addition,  Lessee may make or
permit to be made such  alterations  and  modifications  in and additions to the
Aircraft (each an "OPTIONAL  MODIFICATION") as Lessee or any Permitted Sublessee
deems  desirable in the proper  conduct of its  business,  including  removal of
Parts which Lessee deems are obsolete or no longer  suitable or appropriate  for
use in the Aircraft (PROVIDED, that Lessee's right to remove obsolete Parts will
be  limited to Parts  having an  aggregate  original  cost not  exceeding  1% of
Lessor's Cost of the Aircraft with Lessor having the right to request such parts
be shipped to Owner Participant upon removal at Lessee's expense; PROVIDED, that
no such  Optional  Modification  shall  (1)  diminish  the  fair  market  value,
estimated  residual value,  utility,  or economic useful life of the Aircraft or
any Engine below its fair market value,  estimated residual value,  utility,  or
economic useful life immediately before such Optional Modification (assuming the
Aircraft or such Engine was in the condition  required by the Lease  immediately
before such Optional Modification),  (2) cause the Aircraft to cease to have the
applicable  standard  airworthiness  certificate,  or (3) cause the  Aircraft to
become "limited use property" within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 79-48.  Except as
otherwise  provided  herein,  title to all Parts (other than Removable Parts (as
defined below))  incorporated or installed in or attached to the Aircraft as the
result of such Optional  Modification shall, without further act, vest in Lessor
and become subject to this Lease and the Mortgage.  Notwithstanding  anything to
the  contrary in this ss. D, Lessee or a  Permitted  Sublessee  may, at any time
during  the Term,  removE any Part  (such  Part  being  referred  to herein as a
"REMOVABLE PART") if (aa) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of
or  substitution  for,  any Part  originally  incorporated  or  installed  in or
attached to the  Aircraft at the time of delivery  thereof to Lessee or any Part
in replacement  of, or  substitution  for, any such Part,  (bb) such Part is not
required to be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Aircraft pursuant
to the  terms of ss. A of this  Annex C or the first  sentence  of this ss. D or
pursuant to the terms of any insuraNCE policies required to be carried hereunder
or any  applicable  law,  and (cc) such Part can be removed from the Airframe or
Engine  without in any  material  respect  diminishing  the fair  market  value,
estimated  residual value,  utility,  or remaining economic useful life that the
Airframe or Engine  would have had at the time of removal  had such  removal not
occurred,  assuming that such Airframe or Engine was in the condition and repair
required to be  maintained by the terms hereof and such  Removable  Part had not
been  incorporated or installed in or attached to the Aircraft.  Removable Parts
may be leased from or financed by third parties other than Lessor.  Title to any
Removable  Part  shall  not  vest in  Lessor  or be  subject  to the Lien of the
Mortgage; except that any Part not removed before the return to Lessor hereunder
of the Airframe or Engine on which it is  incorporated,  installed,  or attached
shall become the property of Lessor.

         E.       RECORDS.
                  -------

         Lessee  shall  maintain  (or  cause  to  be  maintained)  all  Aircraft
Documents. All Aircraft Documents that are specific to the Aircraft shall be the
property  of Lessor,  but shall  become the  property  of Lessee  upon  Lessee's
purchase  of the  Aircraft  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Lease  or upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss and Lessee's compliance with ss. 10.

                                     ANNEX D

                                    INSURANCE

         The  terms  defined  in  Annex  A  to  Lease  Agreement  N___AT,   when
capitalized as in Annex A, have the same meanings when used in this  "Insurance"
Annex.  Annex A also contains rules of usage that control  construction  in this
"Insurance" Annex.

A.       LIABILITY INSURANCE

         1. Except as provided in ss. A2 below, Lessee will carry or cause to be
carried at all times, at nO expense to Lessor, Owner Participant,  or Mortgagee,
comprehensive  airline legal liability (including passenger liability,  property
damage, and contractual  liability insurance) with respect to the Aircraft which
is (a) in an amount not less than the greater of (x) the amount of comprehensive
airline legal liability insurance from time to time applicable to aircraft owned
or leased  and  operated  by Lessee of the same type and  operating  on  similar
routes as the  Aircraft,  and (y) the  Minimum  Liability  Insurance  Amount per
occurrence;  (b) of the type and  covering  the same  risks as from time to time
applicable to aircraft,  operated by Lessee and similarly-situated  carriers, of
the same type as the  Aircraft;  and (c)  maintained  in effect with insurers of
internationally recognized responsibility in the international aviation industry
(such insurers being referred to herein as "APPROVED INSURERS").

         2.  During any  period  that the  Aircraft  is on the ground and not in
operation,  Lessee may carry or cause to be  carried,  in lieu of the  insurance
required by ss. A1 above,  insurance otherwise conforming with thE provisions of
ss. A1 except that (a) the  amounts of coverage  shall not be required to exceed
the amounts of publiC  liability and property damage insurance from time to time
applicable  to  aircraft  owned or  operated  by  Lessee of the same type as the
Aircraft which are on the ground and not in operation,  and (b) the scope of the
risks  covered and the type of insurance  shall be the same as from time to time
shall be  applicable  to  aircraft  owned or operated by Lessee of the same type
which are on the ground and not in operation.

B.       HULL INSURANCE

         1. Except as provided in ss. B2 below, Lessee will carry or cause to be
carried at all times, at nO expense to Lessor, Owner Participant,  or Mortgagee,
with Approved  Insurers  "all-risk"  ground and flight  aircraft hull  insurance
covering the  Aircraft  (including  the Engines  when they are  installed on the
Airframe  or any  other  airframe)  which  is of the  type as from  time to time
applicable  to aircraft  operated by Lessee of the same type as the Aircraft for
an amount denominated in United States Dollars not less than the Stipulated Loss
Value of the Aircraft

         Any  policies  of  insurance  carried  in  accordance  with this ss. B1
covering the Aircraft and any policieS taken out in  substitution or replacement
for any such policies (a) shall name  Mortgagee (or, if the Lien of the Mortgage
has been discharged, Lessor) as exclusive loss payee for any proceeds to be paid
under such policies up to an amount equal to the Stipulated Loss Value,  and (b)
shall provide that (aa) in the event of a loss  involving  proceeds in excess of
the Threshold Amount, the proceeds in respect of such loss up to an amount equal
to the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft shall be payable to Mortgagee (or,
if the Lien of the Mortgage has been discharged,  to Lessor), except in the case
of a loss with  respect to an Engine  installed  on an  airframe  other than the
Airframe,  in which case Lessee (or any Permitted  Sublessee)  shall endeavor to
arrange for any payment of insurance proceeds in respect of such loss to be held
for the  account  of  Mortgagee  (or,  if the  Lien  of the  Mortgage  has  been
discharged,  Lessor),  whether such payment is made to Lessee (or any  Permitted
Sublessee)  or any third party [and,  if Mortgagee  (or Lessor)  receives such a
payment  otherwise  than in respect of an Event of Loss,  then,  upon receipt of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee (or Lessor) that the damage giving
rise to such payment has been  repaired or that such payment is then required to
pay for repairs then being made,  Mortgagee  (or Lessor) shall pay the amount of
such  payment to Lessee or its  order],  and (bb) the entire  amount of any loss
involving proceeds of the Threshold Amount or less or the amount of any proceeds
of any loss in excess of the  Stipulated  Loss Value for the  Aircraft  shall be
paid to Lessee or its  order  unless a Lease  Event of  Default  exists  and the
insurers have been notified thereof by Lessor or the Mortgagee. In the case of a
loss with respect to an engine (other than an Engine) installed on the Airframe,
Lessor shall hold any payment to it of any insurance  proceeds for that loss for
the account of Lessee or any other  third party who is entitled to receive  such
proceeds.

         2.  During any  period  that the  Aircraft  is on the ground and not in
operation,  Lessee may carry or cause to be  carried,  in lieu of the  insurance
required by ss. B1 above,  insurance otherwise conforming with thE provisions of
ss. B1,  except that the scope of the risks and the type of  insurance  shall be
the same as from timE to time applicable to aircraft owned by Lessee of the same
type similarly on the ground and not in operation,  PROVIDED,  that Lessee shall
maintain  insurance  against risk of loss or damage to the Aircraft in an amount
equal to the Stipulated  Loss Value of the Aircraft  during such period that the
Aircraft is on the ground and not in operation.

C.       WAR-RISK, HIJACKING, AND ALLIED PERILS INSURANCE

         If Lessee (or any Permitted  Sublessee) operates or proposes to operate
the  Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  or any  Engine  (1) in any  area  of  recognized
hostilities,  or (2) on  international  routes  and  Lessee  (or such  Permitted
Sublessee) maintains war-risk,  hijacking,  or allied perils insurance for other
aircraft that it operates on such routes or in such areas, Lessee shall maintain
or cause to be maintained  war-risk,  hijacking,  and allied perils insurance of
substantially  the same type carried by similar  United  States  commercial  air
carriers  operating the same or comparable  models of aircraft on similar routes
or in such  areas,  and in no event in an amount less than the  Stipulated  Loss
Value.

D.       GENERAL PROVISIONS

         Any policies of insurance  carried in accordance  with ss.ss. A, B, and
C, including any policies  taken out IN  substitution  or  replacement  for such
policies:

     (1) shall name Lessor,  each Participant,  the Liquidity Provider (if any),
and Mortgagee  (and in respect of liability  insurances,  to the extent they are
available  without  unreimbursed  additional  cost  to  Lessee,  each  of  their
respective successors,  assigns, directors,  agents, officers, and employees) as
additional insureds (the "ADDITIONAL INSUREDS"), as their interests may appear;

     (2)  shall  apply  worldwide  and  have  no  territorial   restrictions  or
limitations  (except  only in the  case of war,  hijacking,  and  allied  perils
insurance  required  under  ss.  C,  which  shall  apply to thE  fullest  extent
available in the international insurance market);

     (3) shall  provide  that,  in respect of the  interests  of the  Additional
Insureds in such policies, the insurance shall not be invalidated or impaired by
any act or omission  (including  misrepresentation  and nondisclosure) by Lessee
(or any  Permitted  Sublessee)  or any other Person  (including  use for illegal
purposes  of the  Aircraft  or any  Engine),  and shall  insure  the  Additional
Insureds regardless of any breach or violation of any representation,  warranty,
declaration,  term,  or condition  contained in such  policies by Lessee (or any
Permitted Sublessee);

     (4) shall  provide  that,  if the insurers  cancel such  insurance  for any
reason whatsoever, or if it is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, or if
any  material  change  is made in the  insurance  which  adversely  affects  the
interest of any of the Additional Insureds, such cancellation,  lapse, or change
shall not be effective as to the Additional  Insureds for 30 days (seven days in
the case of war risk,  hijacking,  and allied perils insurance) after receipt by
the Additional Insureds of written notice by such insurers of such cancellation,
lapse or change,  PROVIDED,  that if any notice  period  specified  above is not
reasonably obtainable, such policies shall provide for as long a period of prior
notice as shall then be reasonably obtainable;

     (5) shall waive any rights of recourse,  subrogation, setoff (including for
unpaid  premiums),  recoupment,  counterclaim,  or other  deduction,  whether by
attachment or otherwise, against each Additional Insured;

     (6) shall be primary without right of contribution from any other insurance
that may be available to any Additional Insured;

     (7) shall provide that all of the liability  insurance  provisions thereof,
except the limits of  liability,  shall operate in all respects as if a separate
policy had been issued covering each party insured thereunder;

     (8) shall provide that none of the Additional  Insureds shall be liable for
any insurance premium; and

     (9)  shall  contain  a 50/50  Clause  per  Lloyd's  Aviation  Underwriters'
Association Standard Policy Form AVS 103;

     PROVIDED,  that any such  endorsements may be subject to any limitations on
endorsements  generally  prevailing in the airline insurance  marketplace at the
time (E.G., AVN67B).

E.       REPORTS AND CERTIFICATES; OTHER INFORMATION

         On or before the  Delivery  Date and on or before each  renewal date of
the insurance  policies required  hereunder (and no less often than on an annual
basis),  Lessee  will  furnish  or  cause  to  be  furnished  to  Lessor,  Owner
Participant,  and  Mortgagee  insurance  certificates  describing  in reasonable
detail the insurance maintained hereunder and a report,  signed by Lessee's or a
Permitted  Sublessee's  regular  independent  insurance  broker (the  "INSURANCE
BROKER"), stating the opinion of such Insurance Broker that (1) all premiums for
the insurance then due have been paid, and (2) such insurance  complies with the
terms  of  this  Annex  D. To the  extent  that  such  agreement  is  reasonably
obtainable,  Lessee  will  also  cause the  Insurance  Broker to agree to notify
Lessor,  Owner  Participant,  and  Mortgagee  in writing  of any  default in the
payment of any premium and of any other act or omission on the part of Lessee of
which the Insurance  Broker has  knowledge and which might  invalidate or render
unenforceable,  in whole or in part, any insurance on the Aircraft or Engines or
cause the  cancellation or termination of such insurance,  and to notify Lessor,
Owner  Participant,  and  Mortgagee  in writing at least 30 days (seven days for
war-risk and allied perils  coverage,  or such shorter period therefor as may be
available in the  international  insurance  market,  as  applicable)  before the
cancellation,  lapse, or materially  adverse change of any insurance  maintained
pursuant to this Annex D.

F.       RIGHT TO PAY PREMIUMS

         Each  Additional  Insured shall have the rights but not the obligations
of an additional named insured.  No Additional Insured shall have any obligation
to pay any premium,  commission,  assessment,  or call due on any such insurance
(including  reinsurance).   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  of
cancellation of any required insurance due to the nonpayment of premium, each of
Lessor,  Owner  Participant,  and Mortgagee  shall have the option,  in its sole
discretion,  to pay any such premium and to maintain such  coverage,  as Lessor,
Owner Participant,  or Mortgagee may require, until the scheduled expiry date of
such insurance and, in such event, Lessee shall, upon demand,  reimburse Lessor,
Owner Participant, and Mortgagee for amounts that they so pay.

G.       DEDUCTIBLES; SELF-INSURANCE

         Lessee  may  self-insure  by way  of  deductible,  premium  adjustment,
franchise  provisions,  or  otherwise  (including,  with  respect  to  insurance
maintained  pursuant to ss. B, insuring for a maximum  amount which is lesS than
the  Stipulated  Loss Value of the Aircraft)  the  insurance  covering the risks
required  to be  insured  against  pursuant  to ss. 11 and this  Annex D under a
program  applicable to all aircraft in Lessee's fleet,  but in no casE shall the
aggregate  amount of  self-insurance  (including any  applicable  deductible) in
regard to ss. 11 and thiS Annex D during any policy  year,  with  respect to the
Aircraft,  exceed (CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED). In addition,  Lessee (and any
Permitted   Sublessee)  may  self-insure  to  the  extent  that  any  applicable
deductible per aircraft that does not exceed  industry  standards for major U.S.
airlines.

                             LEASE AGREEMENT N___AT


         This Lease  Agreement  N___AT (this  "LEASE")  dated as of  __________,
200_, between (1) First Security Bank, National Association,  a national banking
association,  not in its  individual  capacity  (except  as  expressly  provided
herein) but solely as Owner Trustee ("LESSOR"), and (2) American Trans Air, Inc.
("LESSEE"), an Indiana corporation.

         Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:

                         1. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

         The terms defined in Annex A, when  capitalized as in Annex A, have the
same meanings when used in this Lease. Annex A also contains rules of usage that
control construction in this Lease.

                           2. DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

         2.1               DELIVERY AND LEASE OF AIRCRAFT

         Lessor  hereby  leases the Aircraft to Lessee for the Term,  and Lessee
hereby leases the Aircraft from Lessor for the Term.

         2.2               ACCEPTANCE BY LESSEE

         Lessee hereby  confirms to Lessor that Lessee has duly and  irrevocably
accepted delivery of the Aircraft for all purposes of this Lease.

                                3. TERM AND RENT

         3.1               TERM

         The Aircraft shall be leased hereunder for the Term,  unless this Lease
or the leasing of the  Aircraft is earlier  terminated  in  accordance  with any
provision of this Lease.

         3.2               RENT

     3.2.1 BASIC RENT; ADJUSTMENTS TO BASIC RENT AND CERTAIN OTHER AMOUNTS

         (a)......During  the Base Term,  Lessee  shall pay to  Lessor,  on each
Payment Date,  Basic Rent in the amount equal to the percentage of Lessor's Cost
specified  in  Schedule 2 for such  Payment  Date.  The  amounts  and periods of
Lessee's  liability  for Basic Rent shall be as  allocated  in  accordance  with
Schedule  2A. Such Basic Rent  payments and such  allocations  shall be adjusted
pursuant to ss. 3.2.1(b).  During any Renewal Term,  Lessee shall pay to Lessor,
on each  Payment  Date,  Basic Rent equal to the Renewal  Rent for that  Renewal
Term, determined pursuant to ss. 17.2.2.

         (b)......Basic  Rent, Basic Rent  allocations,  Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values, and EBO Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

                  (1) If Transaction Expenses paid by Lessor pursuant to ss. 9.2
         of the Participation  Agreement are determined to be other than 2.0% of
         Lessor's Cost, then the Basic Rent percentages in Schedule 2, the Basic
         Rent allocations in Schedule 2A, the Stipulated Loss Value  percentages
         in Schedule 3, the Termination Value percentages in Schedule 4, and the
         EBO  Price  shall  be  recalculated  (upwards  or  downwards)  by Owner
         Participant,  on or before the 120th day after the Delivery  Date using
         the same methods and assumptions used to calculate original Basic Rent,
         EBO Price, Stipulated Loss Value, and Termination Value percentages, in
         order (aa) to maintain Owner  Participant's  Net Economic  Return,  and
         (bb) to the extent  possible  consistent  with  clause (aa) of this ss.
         3.2.1(b)(1), to minimize the Net Present Value of Rents to Lessee.

                  (2)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in no event  shall  any
         adjustment  to the EBO  Price be made  such  that the EBO Price is less
         than the greatest of (aa) the adjusted  Stipulated Loss Value as of the
         EBO Date,  (bb) the estimated  fair market value of the Aircraft on the
         EBO Date as set forth in the Appraisal  referred to in ss.  5.1.2(m) of
         the Participation  Agreement, and (cc) the sum of the present values of
         (i) Basic Rent payable, as adjusted, during the Base Term after the EBO
         Date,  and (ii) the appraised  fair market value of the Aircraft at the
         end of the Base Term as estimated in the  Appraisal  referred to in ss.
         5.1.2(m) of the  Participation  Agreement,  each discounted back to the
         EBO Date (using a discount rate of 16.5 %).

         (c) All adjustments  pursuant to ss. 3.2.1(b) shall be made as promptly
as  practicable  after  either Owner  Participant  or Lessee gives notice to the
other that an event has occurred that requires an adjustment.  Owner Participant
and  Lessee  shall give  prompt  notice to the other of any event  requiring  an
adjustment.  Any recalculation of the percentages of Basic Rent payments,  Basic
Rent allocations,  Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value, and EBO Price shall
be  prepared by Owner  Participant,  subject to  verification  at the request of
Lessee  in  accordance  with  this  ss.  3.2.1(c),  on the  basis  of  the  same
methodology  and  assumptions  used by  Owner  Participant  in  determining  the
percentages of Basic Rent,  Stipulated Loss Value,  Termination  Value,  and EBO
Price as of the Delivery Date,  except as such assumptions have been modified to
reflect the events giving rise to adjustments  hereunder and taking into account
the law applicable at the time of such adjustment.  Promptly after an adjustment
is made hereunder,  Owner  Participant  shall deliver to Lessee a description of
such adjustment, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation thereof. All
adjustments (1) shall be made so as to avoid  characterization of the Lease as a
"disqualified  leaseback or long-term  agreement" within the meaning of Code ss.
467 and Treasury Regulations thereunder, and (2) shall be in compliance with the
requirements  of ss.  4(1) and ss.  4(6) of Revenue  Procedure  75-21 and ss.ss.
4.02(5),  4.07(l),  and 4.07(2) of Revenue Procedure 75-28, except to the extent
that on the Delivery  Date the Lease  constituted a  "disqualified  leaseback or
long-term  agreement"  or was  not in  compliance  with  the  Revenue  Procedure
sections  referred to in clause (2). In connection with any such  adjustments to
payments and allocations of Basic Rent,  appropriate  corresponding  adjustments
shall be made to the  percentages  set forth on Schedules 3 and 4 in the columns
headed "Deferred Basic Rent Amount" and "Prepaid Basic Rent Amount".  All of the
foregoing adjustments shall be set forth in an amendment to this Lease.

         (d) If  Lessee  believes  that any  calculations  by Owner  Participant
pursuant to ss. 3.2.1(c) are in error,  and if, after  consultation,  Lessee and
Owner  Participant do not agree on an adjustment,  then a  nationally-recognized
firm of  accountants  selected by Lessee and  reasonably  satisfactory  to Owner
Participant  shall  verify  such  calculations.   Owner  Participant  will  make
available to such firm (but not to Lessee or any  representative  of Lessee) the
methodology  and assumptions  referred to in ss. 3.2.1(c) and any  modifications
thereto made to reflect the events giving rise to adjustments hereunder (subject
to the  execution  by  such  firm  of a  confidentiality  agreement,  reasonably
acceptable to Owner Participant,  prohibiting disclosure of such methodology and
assumptions to any third party).  The  determination by such firm of accountants
shall be  final.  Lessee  will pay the  reasonable  costs and  expenses  of such
verification by such accountants, except that if it results in (1) a decrease in
Basic Rent which  decreases  the  remaining Net Present Value of Rents by ten or
more basis points from the remaining Net Present Value of Rents as  recalculated
by Owner  Participant,  or (2) a material  reduction in Stipulated  Loss Values,
Termination Values, or the EBO Price, then Owner Participant will pay such costs
and expenses.

                           3.2.2            SUPPLEMENTAL RENT

         Lessee  shall pay to Lessor,  or to whomever is entitled to it, any and
all Supplemental Rent when and as it becomes due and owing. Lessee will also pay
to Lessor, or to whomever is entitled to it, as Supplemental Rent, to the extent
permitted by  applicable  Law,  interest at the Past-Due Rate on any part of any
amount of Rent  (including  Supplemental  Rent) not paid by 11:00 a.m., New York
time, on the date when due (so long as, in the case of any Person not a party to
the Participation Agreement, Lessee had received timely notice of the account to
which such payment was required to be made),  for the period from and  including
the date on which the same was due to (but  excluding)  the date of  payment  in
full.

         3.3               PAYMENTS

         (a)  Payments  of Rent by  Lessee  shall  be paid by wire  transfer  of
immediately available Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the date when due,  to the  account  of Lessor  specified  in  Schedule 1 to the
Participation Agreement (or to such other account in the United States as Lessor
specifies to Lessee in writing at least 10 Business  Days before such payment of
Rent is due),  or, in the case of any  payment of  Supplemental  Rent  expressly
payable to a Person  other than  Lessor,  to the Person  that shall be  entitled
thereto, to such account in the United States as such Person specifies from time
to time to Lessee at least 10 Business Days before such payment of Rent is due.

         (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment
of Rent shall be due on a day that is not a Business  Day, such payment shall be
made on the next day that is a Business  Day,  and,  if such  payment is made on
such next Business  Day, no interest  shall accrue on the amount of such payment
during such extension.

         (c) All  computations of interest under this Lease shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days composed of twelve 30-day months.

     4. DISCLAIMER; CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF LESSOR; SECTION 1110 MATTERS

         4.1               DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

     LESSOR  LEASES AND LESSEE  TAKES THE  AIRCRAFT  "AS-IS,  WHERE-IS."  LESSEE
ACKNOWLEDGES   AND  AGREES  THAT,  AS  BETWEEN   LESSEE  AND  LESSOR  AND  OWNER

interest in such engine as the result of the  installation of such engine on the
Airframe  at any time while such  engine is subject to such  lease,  conditional
sale, or other security agreement and owned by such lessor or conditional seller

     5.1 COMPLIANCE WITH ANNEX B

         Lessee  shall  comply  with each of the  provisions  of Annex B,  which
provisions  are hereby  incorporated  by this  reference as if set forth in full
herein.

     5.2 PARKING AND RELATED MATTERS

         If Lessor  gives  written  notice to Lessee,  not less than 10 days nor
more  than  120 days  before  the end of the  Term,  requesting  parking  of the
Aircraft upon its return  hereunder,  Lessee will assist Lessor in procuring (or
cause Lessor to be provided  with) outdoor  parking  facilities for the Aircraft
for a storage  period up to 30 days,  starting on the date of such  return,  and
upon  Lessor's  request to Lessee  made at least 10 days  before the end of such
initial  30-day  period,   for  an  additional  90-day  period  commencing  upon
expiration of such initial period, at such storage facility in the 48 contiguous
states of the United States as Lessee selects. Such storage shall be at Lessor's
risk, and Lessor shall pay all applicable storage fees, except that Lessee shall
pay the parking fees for the initial 30-day  storage  period;  PROVIDED  FURTHER
that  Lessee's  obligation  to provide  parking  shall be  subject  to  Lessor's
entering into an agreement with the storage facility,  before the storage period
begins, providing that Lessor shall bear all maintenance charges and other costs
incurred, and that Lessee's obligations hereunder will be solely for the payment
of parking fees for the initial 30-day period  pursuant to the terms of this ss.
5.2. Unless Lessor and Lessee otherwise agree, the location of such parking will
also constitute the return location for the Aircraft.

     5.3 RETURN OF OTHER ENGINES

         If any Engine  owned by Lessor is not  installed on the Airframe at the
time of return  hereunder,  Lessee shall return the  Airframe  hereunder  with a
Replacement  Engine meeting the  requirements of, and in accordance with, ss. 10
and Annex B. Thereupon,  Lessor will transfer to Lessee the Engine  constituting
part of such  Aircraft  but not  installed  on such  Airframe at the time of the
return of the Airframe.

     5.4 FUEL

         Upon the return of the  Airframe  upon any  termination  of this Lease,
Lessor shall pay Lessee,  as  compensation  for any fuel or oil contained in the
fuel or oil tanks of such  Airframe,  the value of such fuel or oil at the price
paid by Lessee for such fuel or oil. However,  if the Aircraft is being returned
in  connection  with the exercise of remedies  pursuant to ss. 15,  Lessor shall
have no  obligation  to make such payment to Lessee until Lessor shall have been
paid all amounts due to it pursuant to ss. 15.

     6. LIENS

         Lessee shall not,  directly or indirectly,  create,  incur,  assume, or
suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  any
Engine, or any Part, title to any of the foregoing,  or any interest therein, or
Lessee's rights in and to this Lease or any Permitted  Sublease,  except (a) the
rights of Lessor, Owner Participant,  and Lessee under the Operative Agreements,
and of any Permitted Sublessee under any Permitted  Sublease;  (b) Lessor Liens;
(c) the  rights  of  others  under  agreements  or  arrangements  to the  extent
permitted  by ss. 7.2,  ss. 7.3, or Annex C; (d) Liens for Taxes  either not yet
due or being  contested in good faith by  appropriate  proceedings if such Liens
and such  proceedings  do not involve  more than a DE MINIMIS  risk of the sale,
forfeiture,  or loss of the Aircraft,  the Airframe, any Engine, or the interest
of  Owner  Participant   therein;  (e)  materialmen's,   mechanics',   workers',
repairers',  employees',  or other like Liens arising in the ordinary  course of
business for amounts the payment of which either is not yet  delinquent for more
than 60 days or is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings,  if
such Liens and such  proceedings  do not involve any more than a DE MINIMIS risk
of the sale,  forfeiture,  or loss of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine, or
the interest of Owner Participant therein; (f) Liens arising out of any judgment
or award  against  Lessee,  if,  within 60 days  after the entry  thereof,  that
judgment or award is discharged or vacated,  or has its execution stayed pending
appeal,  or is  discharged,  vacated,  or  reversed  within  60 days  after  the
expiration  of such stay,  and if during any such 60-day period there is not, or
any such judgment or award does not involve,  more than a DE MINIMIS risk of the
sale,  forfeiture,  or loss of the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  any Engine,  or the
interest of Owner  Participant  therein;  and (g) any other Lien with respect to
which Lessee or any Permitted  Sublessee  provides a bond, cash  collateral,  or
other  security  adequate  in the  reasonable  opinion of Lessor.  Lessee  shall
promptly  take or cause to be taken  such  action  as may be  necessary  duly to
discharge (by bonding or otherwise)  any Lien not excepted  above that arises in
respect of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine, or any Part during the Term.

     7. REGISTRATION; OPERATION; POSSESSION AND SUBLEASING

     7.1 REGISTRATION AND OPERATION

     7.1.1 REGISTRATION AND RECORDATION

         Subject  to  Lessor's  and Owner  Participant's  compliance  with their
obligations under ss. 13 of the Participation Agreement,  Lessee shall cause the
Aircraft to be, and at all times during the Term to remain, duly registered with
the FAA under the Transportation  Code or with such other country of registry as
shall be permitted  under ss. 7.1.2  hereof,  in the name of Lessor as owner and
lessor  (except to the extent that such  registration  under the  Transportation
Code is prevented or lost because of Lessor's or Owner Participant's  failure to
comply with the citizenship  requirements for registration of the Aircraft under
the Transportation Code). Lessor shall execute and deliver all such documents as
Lessee  or any  Permitted  Sublessee  reasonably  requests  for the  purpose  of
effecting  and  continuing  such  registration.  Each of the  registrations  and
recordations  referenced in this ss. 7.1.1 will be at Lessee's cost and expense,
except as otherwise provided in this Lease.

     7.1.2 REREGISTRATION

         After the Tax Attribute  Period (or before such date,  provided  Lessee
pre-pays on a lump-sum basis any liability due under the Tax Indemnity Agreement
as a result of such registration on the assumption that such registration  would
continue for the  remainder of the term of the Permitted  Sublease  described in
ss. 7.6.11(a)(3) of the Participation  Agreement, if no Special Default or Event
of Default exists,  Lessee may, by written notice to Lessor (with a copy of such
notice to Owner  Participant),  request to change the country of registration of
the  Aircraft.  Any  such  change  in  registration  shall be  effected  only in
compliance  with,  and subject to all of the conditions set forth in, ss. 7.6.11
of the Participation Agreement.

     7.1.3 MARKINGS

         If permitted by  applicable  Law, on or reasonably  promptly  after the
Delivery  Date,  Lessee  will cause to be affixed  to,  and  maintained  in, the
cockpit of the Airframe and on each  Engine,  in each case in a clearly  visible
location,  a placard of a reasonable size and shape bearing the legend set forth
in Schedule 6. Such placards may be removed  temporarily,  if necessary,  in the
course of maintenance of the Airframe or Engines. If any such placard is damaged
or becomes illegible,  Lessee shall promptly replace it with a placard complying
with the requirements of this ss. 7.1.3.

     7.1.4 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

         Lessee  shall not,  and shall not allow any other  Person to,  operate,
use, maintain, service, repair, overhaul, improve, or modify the Aircraft (a) in
violation of any Law binding on or applicable to the Aircraft,  the Airframe, or
any Engine, or (b) in violation of any airworthiness  certificate,  license,  or
registration of any Government Entity relating to the Aircraft, the Airframe, or
any Engine,  except (1) immaterial or  non-recurring  violations with respect to
which corrective  measures are taken promptly by Lessee or a Permitted Sublessee
(as  applicable)  upon  discovery  thereof,  and (2) to the extent Lessee or any
Permitted Sublessee is contesting the validity or application of any such Law or
requirement  relating to any such certificate,  license, or registration in good
faith in any  reasonable  manner  which does not involve  more than a DE MINIMIS
risk of the sale, forfeiture,  or loss of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine
or the interest of Owner Participant  therein, any risk of criminal liability or
of material civil penalty against Lessor or Owner Participant.

     7.1.5 OPERATION

         Lessee  agrees  not to  operate,  use,  or  locate  the  Aircraft,  the
Airframe,  or any Engine, or allow the Aircraft,  the Airframe, or any Engine to
be operated,  used,  or located,  (a) in any area  excluded from coverage by any
insurance  required by the terms of ss. 11,  except in the case of a requisition
by the U.S.  Government where the U.S.  Government provides an indemnity in lieu
of such insurance, or insurance from the U.S. Government, covering such area, in
accordance  with ss. 11.3, or (b) in any recognized  area of hostilities  unless
fully  covered in accordance  with Annex D by war-risk  insurance as required by
the terms of ss. 11 (including ss. 11.3), unless in any case referred to in this
ss. 7.1.5 the Aircraft is only  temporarily  operated,  used, or located in such
area as a result of an emergency,  equipment  malfunction,  navigational  error,
hijacking, weather condition, or other similar unforeseen circumstances, so long
as Lessee diligently and in good faith proceeds to remove the Aircraft from such
area.

     7.2 POSSESSION

         Lessee will not,  without the prior written consent of Lessor and Owner
Participant,   sublease  or  otherwise  in  any  manner  deliver,  transfer,  or
relinquish  possession of the Aircraft,  the Airframe, or any Engine, or install
any Engine, or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the
Airframe;  PROVIDED,  that,  subject to the  provisions of ss. 7.3,  Lessee may,
without such prior written consent:

     7.2.1 INTERCHANGE AND POOLING

         Subject or permit any  Permitted  Sublessee to subject (a) the Airframe
         to  normal   interchange   agreements   (provided  that  (1)  any  such
         interchange  agreement does not contemplate that Lessee (or a Permitted
         Sublessee) will be out of possession of the Airframe for more than five
         consecutive  days at a time  (absent  weather,  maintenance,  or  other
         exigencies),  and (2) the  party  to such  interchange  agreement  is a
         Permitted  Air Carrier,  not in  bankruptcy,  organized  and having its
         principal  place of business in a country with which the United  States
         then maintains  normal  diplomatic  relations and which  recognizes and
         gives  effect to the  rights,  title,  and  interests  of Lessor in the
         Airframe), or (b) any Engine (but only if such Engine is then installed
         upon  an  aircraft)  to  normal   interchange   agreements  or  pooling
         agreements or  arrangements,  in each case  customary in the commercial
         airline industry and entered into by Lessee or such Permitted Sublessee
         in the  ordinary  course  of  business;  PROVIDED,  that  (1)  no  such
         agreement or  arrangement  shall require any transfer of Lessor's title
         to the Airframe or such Engine,  and (2) if Lessor's  title to any such
         Engine  is   nevertheless   divested   under  any  such   agreement  or
         arrangement, then such Engine shall be deemed to have suffered an Event
         of  Loss as of the  date  of such  divestiture,  and  Lessee  shall  be
         required to replace such Engine with a Replacement  Engine  meeting the
         requirements of, and in accordance with, ss. 10.

     7.2.2 TESTING AND SERVICE

         Deliver or permit any Permitted  Sublessee to deliver possession of the
         Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine, or any Part (a) to the manufacturer
         thereof  or to  any  third-party  maintenance  provider,  for  testing,
         service,  repair,  maintenance,  or  overhaul  work  on  the  Aircraft,
         Airframe,  any  Engine,  or any Part,  or, to the  extent  required  or
         permitted by the terms of Annex C, for alterations or  modifications in
         or additions to the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  or any Engine,  or (b) to
         any Person for the purpose of transport to a Person  referred to in the
         preceding clause (a).

     7.2.3 TRANSFER TO U.S. GOVERNMENT

         Transfer or permit any  Permitted  Sublessee to transfer  possession of
         the  Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  or any  Engine  to the U.S.  Government
         pursuant to CRAF or  otherwise,  in which event Lessee  shall  promptly
         notify Lessor in writing of any such  transfer of  possession  (and, in
         the case of any transfer pursuant to CRAF, in such  notification  shall
         identify by name, address, and telephone numbers the Contracting Office
         Representative(s) for the Military Airlift Command of the United States
         Air Force to whom notices must be given and to whom  requests or claims
         must be made to the extent applicable under CRAF).

     7.2.4 INSTALLATION OF ENGINES ON OWNED AIRCRAFT

         Install or permit any  Permitted  Sublessee  to install an Engine on an
         airframe owned by Lessee or such Permitted  Sublessee free and clear of
         all Liens except (a)  Permitted  Liens,  (b) Liens that do not apply to
         the  Engines,  and  (c)  the  rights  of  third  parties  under  normal
         interchange  or  pooling   agreements  and  arrangements  of  the  type
         permitted under ss. 7.2.1.

     7.2.5 INSTALLATION OF ENGINES ON OTHER AIRFRAMES

         Install or permit any  Permitted  Sublessee  to install an Engine on an
         airframe leased to Lessee or such Permitted Sublessee,  or purchased or

         agreement,  conditional sale, or other secured  financing  arrangement,
         but only if (a) such airframe is free and clear of all Liens except (1)
         the  rights  of  the  parties  to  such  lease  or  secured   financing
         arrangement,  covering  such  airframe,  and  (2)  Liens  of  the  type
         permitted by clauses (a) and (b) of ss.  7.2.4,  and (b) Lessee or such
         Permitted  Sublessee has received from the lessor,  secured  party,  or
         conditional  seller,  in respect of such airframe,  a written agreement
         (which may be a copy of the lease, security agreement, conditional sale
         agreement,  or other agreement  covering such  airframe),  whereby such
         Person  agrees that it will not acquire or claim any right,  title,  or
         interest in, or Lien on, such Engine by reason of the  installation  of
         such  Engine on such  airframe at any time while such Engine is subject
         to this Lease or is owned by Lessor.

     7.2.6 INSTALLATIONS OF ENGINES ON FINANCED AIRCRAFT

         Install or permit any  Permitted  Sublessee  to install an Engine on an
         airframe owned by Lessee or such Permitted Sublessee,  leased to Lessee
         or such  Permitted  Sublessee,  or purchased or owned by Lessee or such
         Permitted  Sublessee  subject to a conditional  sale or other  security
         agreement  under  circumstances  where  neither ss. 7.2.4 nor ss. 7.2.5
         applies;  PROVIDED, that any such installation shall be deemed an Event
         of Loss with respect to such  Engine,  and Lessee shall comply with ss.
         10.2 in respect  thereof.  Until ss. 10.2 has been fully complied with,
         Lessor's  interest  in such  Engine  shall  continue  in full force and
         effect.

                           7.2.7            SUBLEASING

     With respect to the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  or any Engine,  if no Special
Default or Event of Default exists, enter into a sublease with any Permitted Air

     (a)  Lessee  provides  written  notice  to  Lessor  (with a copy  to  Owner
Participant) (such notice in the event of a sublease to a U.S. Air Carrier to be
given  promptly  after  entering into any such  sublease,  and, in the case of a
sublease to any other  Permitted  Air  Carrier,  10 Business  Days in advance of
entering into such sublease);

     (b) at the time that Lessee enters into such  sublease,  such Permitted Air
Carrier  shall  not be  subject  to  any  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  liquidation,
reorganization,   dissolution,   or  similar  proceeding,  and  shall  not  have
substantially all of its property in the possession of any liquidator,  trustee,
receiver, or similar Person;

     (c) any such  sublease (1) shall not extend  beyond the  expiration  of the
Base Term or any  Renewal  Term then in effect or  irrevocably  committed  to by
Lessee,  or contain a purchase  option,  unless  expressly  subject to  Lessee's
exercise of its renewal or purchase  options in accordance with the terms of ss.
17,  and in any event  subject  to the  requirements  of clause  (4) of this ss.
7.2.7(c),  (2) shall not  contain  any  purchase  option  exercisable  at a date
earlier than such date permitted  under ss. 17.3, (3) shall  explicitly  require
that  sublessee or sublessor  (or both with  specified  allocations)  will fully
comply with the Lease's  maintenance,  operation,  possession,  inspection,  and

     (d) in connection with a sublease to a Permitted  Foreign Air Carrier,  (1)
the United States maintains diplomatic relations with the country of domicile of
such Permitted Foreign Air Carrier, and (2) Lessee furnishes to Lessor and Owner
Participant a favorable  opinion of counsel,  reasonably  satisfactory to Lessor
and Owner  Participant,  located in the country of  domicile  of such  Permitted
Foreign Air Carrier,  that (aa) the terms of such sublease are legal, valid, and
binding  obligations of the parties thereto,  enforceable under the laws of such
jurisdiction,  (bb) it is not  necessary  for  Owner  Participant  or  Lessor to
register  or qualify to do  business  in such  jurisdiction,  if not  already so
registered or  qualified,  as a result of the proposed  sublease,  (cc) Lessor's
title to,  the  Aircraft,  Airframe,  and  Engines  will be  recognized  in such
jurisdiction,  (dd) the  Laws of such  jurisdiction  of  domicile  require  fair
compensation  by the  government  of such  jurisdiction,  payable  in a currency
freely  convertible  into  Dollars,  for the  loss  of  title  to the  Aircraft,
Airframe,  or Engines in the event of the requisition by such government of such
title (unless Lessee provides  insurance in the amounts required with respect to
hull insurance  under ss. 11 covering the  requisition of title to the Aircraft,
Airframe,  or  Engines by the  government  of such  jurisdiction  so long as the
Aircraft,  Airframe,  or  Engines  are  subject  to such  sublease),  (ee)  such
Permitted Air Carrier's agreement that its rights under the sublease are subject

Permitted Air Carrier under  applicable Law, and (ff) such sublease will subject
Lessor and Owner  Participant  to no greater tort  liability  than in the United

to greater  tort  liability  than in the United  States of  America,  Lessee (or
Permitted  Sublessee) has provided  insurance to insure against such  additional
liability;

     (e) Lessee furnishes to Lessor and Owner  Participant  evidence  reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor that the insurance required byss. 11 remains in effect;

liability  due under the Tax  Indemnity  Agreement as a result of such  sublease
based upon the assumption  that such sublease were to continue for the remainder
of the term of such sublease;

     (i) no such  sublease  will  adversely  affect  Lessor's  protection  under

an Event of Default exists.

         (b) Lessee shall remain  primarily liable hereunder for the performance
of all the terms of this Lease to the same  extent as if such  transfer  had not
occurred,  and no transfer of  possession of the  Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  any
Engine,  or any Part shall in any way  discharge  or  diminish  any of  Lessee's
obligations to Lessor hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement.

         (c) Lessee  shall  ensure  that no  sublease,  delivery,  transfer,  or

such  term  (as set  forth  in  Annex A) shall  not be  deemed  to  violate  the
provisions of ss. 7.2.

         (e)  No  Wet  Lease  shall   constitute   a  delivery,   transfer,   or
relinquishment of possession for purposes of ss. 7.2, nor shall it be prohibited
by the terms hereof.

         either  has become  economically  obsolete  or is  surplus to  Lessee's
         requirements,  and  Lessee's  Chief  Financial  Officer or Treasurer so
         certifies in writing to Lessor; and

                  (2) Lessee provides Lessor (with a copy to Owner  Participant)

         (e) Lessor shall be under no duty to solicit  bids, to inquire into the

Airframe and any Engine(s)  suffering the Event of Loss,  then Lessee shall,  as
promptly as possible  and in any event within 120 days after the  occurrence  of
such Event of Loss, convey or cause to be conveyed to Lessor, in compliance with
ss. 10.3 and as replacement for the Airframe and any such Engine(s),  title to a
Replacement Airframe (which shall comply with ss. 10.1.3(b)),  and for each such
Engine a Replacement Engine, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens (PROVIDED,  that if such conveyance  occurs after the end of the
Term,  Lessee  shall pay rent for the  Aircraft  from the end of the Term  until
return  thereof  pursuant  to ss. 5 at a daily rate equal to the  average  daily
Basic Rent or Renewal Rent, as applicable,  over the Base Term or  then-expiring
Renewal Term, as applicable).  If Lessee makes such election, but for any reason
does not effect such replacement  within such time period and in compliance with
the  requirements  set forth in ss.  10.3,  then Lessee  shall be deemed to have
initially  made the election set forth in ss. 10.1.2 with the effect that Lessee
shall pay,  in the manner and in funds of the type  specified  in ss.  3.3,  the
amounts required under, and in accordance with, ss. 10.1.2 (except that the time
period for payment  referenced in ss.  10.1.2(a)(1)  shall,  for the purposes of
this ss.  10.1.3(a),  in all cases be on the  Stipulated  Loss  Value Date first
following the 120th day  following  the date of the  occurrence of such Event of
Loss).

         (b) Any such Replacement Airframe shall be an airframe  manufactured by
the Airframe  Manufacturer that is the same model as the Airframe to be replaced
thereby, or an improved model, and that has a current value,  estimated residual
value,  utility,  and remaining economic useful life (without regard to hours or
cycles remaining until the next regular  maintenance check,  provided no Special
Default or Event of Default  then  exists) at least equal to the  Airframe to be
replaced thereby  (assuming that such Airframe had been maintained in accordance
with this Lease), immediately prior to such Event of Loss and that has a year of
manufacture  no  earlier  than that of the  Airframe  to be  replaced.  Any such
Replacement  Engine shall meet the requirements of, and be conveyed by Lessee to
Lessor in accordance with, ss. 10.2 (other than the notice requirement set forth
in ss. 10.2.1).

         10.2              EVENT OF LOSS TO AN ENGINE; ENGINE EXCHANGES

                           10.2.1           NOTICE

         If an Event of Loss to an Engine occurs under circumstances in which no
Event of Loss to the Airframe  occurs,  Lessee shall  promptly (and in any event
within 15 days after such occurrence) notify Lessor of such Event of Loss.

                           10.2.2           REPLACEMENT OF ENGINE

         Lessee  shall,  promptly  and in any  event  within  60 days  after the
occurrence of such Event of Loss,  convey or cause to be conveyed to Lessor,  in
compliance with ss. 10.3 and as replacement for the Engine with respect to which
any Event of Loss occurred, title to a Replacement Engine, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted  Liens.  Such  Replacement  Engine shall be an engine
manufactured by Engine  Manufacturer  that is the same model as the Engine to be
replaced  thereby,  or an improved model,  and that is suitable for installation
and use on the Airframe, and that has a current value, estimated residual value,
utility,  and remaining economic useful life (without regard to hours and cycles
remaining until  overhaul,  provided no Special Default or Event of Default then
exists) at least equal to the Engine to be replaced thereby  (assuming that such
Engine had been  maintained in accordance with the Lease)  immediately  prior to
such Event of Loss.

                           10.2.3           ENGINE EXCHANGE

         Upon not less than five Business  Days' prior written  notice to Lessor
(with a copy to  Owner  Participant),  Lessee  may  replace  any  Engine  leased
hereunder with another engine (the "EXCHANGED  Engine") meeting the requirements
of ss.  10.2.2.  Such  Exchanged  Engine  shall be deemed  to be a  "Replacement
Engine", and Lessor and Lessee shall comply with the provisions of ss. 10.3 with
regard to the Exchanged Engine and the Engine so replaced.

         10.3              CONDITIONS TO ANY REPLACEMENT

                           10.3.1           DOCUMENTS

         Before  or at the  time  of  conveyance  of  title  to any  Replacement
Airframe  or  Replacement  Engine  to  Lessor,  Lessee  shall  take  each of the
following actions:

         (a) furnish Lessor with a full warranty (as to title) bill of sale duly
conveying to Lessor such Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine, in form and
substance  reasonably  satisfactory to Lessor and Owner  Participant,  and cause
such  Replacement  Airframe to be duly registered in the name of Lessor pursuant
to the Transportation Code (or such other applicable Law of a jurisdiction other
than the United States where the Aircraft is  registered in accordance  with ss.
7.1.2);

         (b) cause (1) a supplement to this Lease,  subjecting such  Replacement
Airframe or  Replacement  Engine to this Lease,  duly executed by Lessee,  to be
delivered to Lessor for  execution,  and, upon such  execution,  to be filed for
recordation  with the FAA  pursuant  to the  Transportation  Code (or such other
applicable Law of a jurisdiction other than the United States where the Aircraft
is registered in accordance with ss. 7.1.2),  and (2) such Financing  Statements
and other filings,  as Owner Participant  reasonably  request,  duly executed by
Lessee and (to the extent  applicable)  Lessor  (and  Lessor  shall  execute and
deliver the same),  to be filed in such  locations as any such party  reasonably
requests;

         (c) furnish such evidence of compliance  with the insurance  provisions
of ss. 11 with respect to such  Replacement  Airframe or  Replacement  Engine as
Owner Participant reasonably requests;

         (d) furnish an opinion or opinions  of Lessee's  counsel  (which may be
Lessee's legal  department)  reasonably  satisfactory  to Owner  Participant and
addressed  to Lessor  and Owner  Participant  to the  effect  that (1) such full
warranty  bill of sale  referred to in ss.  10.3.1(a)  constitutes  an effective
instrument  for  the  conveyance  of  title  to  the  Replacement   Airframe  or
Replacement  Engine,  and (2) in the  case  of a  Replacement  Airframe  or of a
Replacement  Engine  substituted  under ss. 10.2.3 in the absence of an Event of
Loss,  (aa) Lessor will be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 with respect
to the  Replacement  Airframe,  and  (bb)  as to the  U.S.  federal  income  tax
consequences to Owner Participant of the replacement;

         (e) furnish an opinion of  Lessee's  aviation  law  counsel  reasonably
satisfactory to Owner  Participant and addressed to Lessor and Owner Participant
as to the due registration of any such  Replacement  Airframe and the due filing
for  recordation  of  each  supplement  to  this  Lease  with  respect  to  such
Replacement  Airframe or Replacement  Engine under the  Transportation  Code (or
such other  applicable Law of a jurisdiction  other than the United States where
the Aircraft is registered in accordance with ss. 7.1.2);

         (f) with respect to the  replacement  of the Airframe and any Engine(s)
installed  thereon  at the  time of the  Event of Loss,  if  requested  by Owner
Participant and at Lessee's  expense,  furnish a certified report of a qualified
independent aircraft appraiser,  such report and such appraiser to be reasonably
satisfactory to Owner Participant, certifying that such Replacement Airframe and
any such Replacement Engine complies with the current value,  estimated residual
value, utility, and remaining economic useful life requirements set forth in ss.
10.1.3(b); and

         (g) take such other  actions and furnish  such other  certificates  and
documents as Lessor or Owner  Participant  may reasonably  request in order that
such Replacement  Airframe or Replacement  Engine be duly and properly titled in
Lessor, leased hereunder and subjected to the Lien of the Trust Indenture to the
same extent as initially required under the Operative Agreements with respect to
the Airframe or Engine so replaced.

         Lessor  and  Lessee  understand  and agree  that if, at the time of any
replacement of the Airframe or any Engine(s) as contemplated in this ss. 10, the
Airframe was registered in a jurisdiction other than the United States, then the
requirements  set forth above in this ss. 10.3.1 relating to compliance with the
requirements of the  Transportation  Code or the FAA shall be deemed to refer to
the  comparable  applicable  Law of, and the Aviation  Authority  of, such other
jurisdiction.

                           10.3.2           OTHER OBLIGATIONS

         (a)  Lessor  and  Lessee  agree  that,  when and after any  Replacement
Airframe  becomes the  Airframe  hereunder,  and when and after any  Replacement
Engine becomes an Engine  hereunder,  this Lease shall continue to be, and shall
be treated as, a lease for U.S.  federal income tax purposes of such Replacement
Airframe and such Replacement Engine. Without limiting the foregoing, Lessee and
Lessor intend that Lessor shall,  in all events,  be entitled to the benefits of
Section 1110 with respect to any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine, and
Lessee  and  Lessor  shall  cooperate  and take  such  action  as the  other may
reasonably  request  so as to  ensure  that  Lessor  shall be  entitled  to such
benefits.

         (b) No Event of Loss to an Engine, or to an Airframe,  shall result in,
or  otherwise  allow or permit  (other than as provided in ss.  10.1.2(b)),  any
reduction,  deferral,  discharge, or other change in the timing or amount of any
Rent payable by Lessee  hereunder,  and (subject to such ss.  10.1.2(b))  Lessee
shall pay all such Rent and other  amounts as though  such Event of Loss had not
occurred.

         10.4              CONVEYANCE TO LESSEE

         Upon compliance by Lessee with the applicable  terms of ss.ss.  10.1.3,
10.2, and 10.3.1,  Lessor will transfer to Lessee the Airframe or Engine(s),  as
applicable,  with respect to which such Event of Loss  occurred,  in  accordance
with ss. 4.5.

         10.5              APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS

         Any amounts, other than insurance proceeds in respect of damage or loss
not  constituting an Event of Loss (the  application of which is provided for in
ss. 11), received at any time by Lessor, Lessee, or any Permitted Sublessee from
any  Government  Entity or any other Person in respect of any Event of Loss will
be paid over to Lessor to be held in  accordance  with ss.  4.5 and  applied  as
follows:

                           10.5.1           REPLACEMENT OF AIRFRAME AND ENGINES

         If such  amounts  are  received  with  respect to the  Airframe  or any
Engine(s)  installed  thereon at the time of such Event of Loss,  upon  Lessee's
compliance with the applicable  terms of ss. 10.1.3 with respect to the Event of
Loss for which such amounts are  received,  such amounts  shall  (subject to ss.
10.9) be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee.

                           10.5.2           LOSS OF ENGINE

         If such amounts are received  with respect to an Engine  (other than an
Engine  installed on the Airframe  when the Airframe  suffers an Event of Loss),
upon Lessee's compliance with the applicable terms of ss. 10.2.2 with respect to
the Event of Loss for which  such  amounts  are  received,  such  amounts  shall
(subject to ss. 10.9) be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee.

                           10.5.3           PAYMENT OF LOSS

         If such amounts are received,  in whole or in part, with respect to the
Airframe,  and Lessee makes, has made or is deemed to have made the election set
forth in ss. 10.1.2, such amounts shall be applied as follows:

     (a) FIRST,  if the sum  described  in ss.  10.1.2 has not then been paid in
full by Lessee,  such amounts shall be paid to Lessor to the extent necessary to
pay in full such sum; and

     (b) SECOND,  the remainder,  if any, shall (subject toss.  10.9) be paid to
Lessee.

         10.6              REQUISITION OF AIRCRAFT FOR USE

         If any Government  Entity  requisitions the use of the Airframe and the
Engines or engines installed thereon, and if the requisition does not constitute
an Event of Loss, Lessee shall promptly notify Lessor of such  requisition,  and
all of Lessee's  obligations  under this Lease shall continue to the same extent
as if such  requisition  had not occurred;  PROVIDED,  that, if the Airframe and
Engines or engines installed thereon are not returned to Lessor by Lessee at the
end of the Term or within 30 days  thereafter,  then  Lessee  shall be deemed to
have made the election set forth in ss. 10.1.2 with the effect that Lessee shall
be  obligated to pay the  Stipulated  Loss Value and all other  amounts  payable
pursuant to ss.  10.1.2 with  respect to the Aircraft as if an Event of Loss had
occurred as of the end of the Term. If such  requisition  does not constitute an
Event of Loss, Lessee shall be obligated to return the Airframe and Engine(s) or
engine(s) to Lessor  pursuant  to, and in all other  respects to comply with the
provisions of, ss. 5 promptly upon their return by such Government  Entity,  and
Lessee  shall  pay (or cause to be paid) to  Lessor  upon such  return an amount
equal to the average daily Basic Rent payable by Lessee during the Term for each
day after the end of the Term to but excluding  the day of such return,  up to a
maximum of 30 days,  which  payment  may be made from any  payments  received by
Lessor  or  Lessee  from  any  Government  Entity  for the  use of the  Aircraft
(notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in ss. 10.8).

         10.7              REQUISITION OF AN ENGINE FOR USE

         If any Government  Entity  requisitions  for use any Engine but not the
Airframe,  Lessee will replace  such Engine by  complying  with ss. 10.2 and ss.
10.3 to the same  extent as if an Event of Loss with  respect to that Engine had
occurred,  and any  payments  received by Lessor or Lessee from such  Government
Entity with respect to such requisition  shall be paid or retained in accordance
with ss. 10.5.2.

         10.8              APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS

         All payments received by Lessor or Lessee, or any Permitted  Sublessee,
from  any  Government  Entity  for  the use of the  Airframe  and  Engine(s)  or
engine(s)  installed  thereon during the Term shall be paid over to, or retained
by,  Lessee,  and all payments  received by Lessor or Lessee from any Government
Entity for the use of the Airframe and Engine(s) or engine(s)  installed thereon
after the Term shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessor; PROVIDED, that, if
such  requisition  constitutes an Event of Loss, then all such payments shall be
paid over to Lessor and held as provided in ss. 10.5.

         10.9              APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS DURING DEFAULT

         Any amount  described in this ss. 10 that is payable or creditable  to,
or  retainable  by,  Lessee  shall not be paid or credited  to, or retained  by,
Lessee  if a Special  Default  or Event of  Default  exists  when such  payment,
credit, or retention would otherwise occur, but shall instead be held by or paid
over to Lessor as security  for  Lessee's  obligations  under this Lease and the
other Lessee  Operative  Agreements,  and shall be invested  pursuant to ss. 4.4
hereof,  unless and until such  amount is applied,  at the option of Lessor,  or
upon Lessee's written request to Lessor,  from time to time during the existence
of an Event of Default, to Lessee's obligations under this Lease as and when due
(any  such  application  shall  be made to such  Lessee  obligations  as  Lessor
determines in its sole discretion).  If and when no Special Default and no Event
of  Default  exists,  such  amount  shall be paid to  Lessee to the  extent  not
previously applied in accordance with this ss. 10.9.

                                  11. INSURANCE

         11.1              LESSEE'S OBLIGATION TO INSURE

         Lessee  shall comply with,  or cause to be complied  with,  each of the
provisions  of  Annex  D,  which  provisions  are  hereby  incorporated  by this
reference as if set forth in full herein.

         11.2              INSURANCE FOR OWN ACCOUNT

         Nothing in ss. 11 shall limit or prohibit  (a) Lessee from  maintaining
the policies of insurance  required  under Annex D with higher limits than those
specified  in  Annex  D, or (b)  Lessor  or  Owner  Participant  from  obtaining
insurance  for its own account (and any  proceeds  payable  under such  separate
insurance  shall  be  payable  as  provided  in the  policy  relating  thereto);
PROVIDED,  that no insurance may be obtained or  maintained  that would limit or
otherwise adversely affect the coverage of or increase the cost of any insurance
required  to be  obtained or  maintained  by Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 11 and
Annex D.

         11.3              INDEMNIFICATION BY GOVERNMENT IN LIEU OF INSURANCE

         During the period of any Government Entity's requisition for use of the
Aircraft or any Engine,  Lessor,  and Owner Participant shall accept, in lieu of
insurance  against any risk with respect to the  Aircraft  described in Annex D,
indemnification  from, or insurance  provided by, the U.S.  Government,  or upon
Owner Participant's written consent,  other Government Entity, against such risk
in an amount that,  when added to the amount of insurance  (including  permitted
self-insurance),  if any,  against  such  risk  that  Lessee  (or any  Permitted
Sublessee) may continue to maintain,  in accordance with this ss. 11, during the
period of such  requisition,  shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance
against such risk otherwise required by this ss. 11.

         11.4              APPLICATION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS

         As between  Lessor and Lessee,  all  insurance  proceeds  received as a
result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss to the Aircraft or any Engine under
policies  required to be  maintained  by Lessee  pursuant to this ss. 11 will be
applied in accordance  with ss. 10.5.  All proceeds of insurance  required to be
maintained by Lessee, in accordance with ss. 11 and ss. B of Annex D, in respect
of any  property  damage  or  loss  not  constituting  an  Event  of Loss to the
Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  or any Engine will be applied to pay (or to reimburse
Lessee) for repairs or for replacement property  incorporated in accordance with
ss. 8.1,  and any  balance  remaining  after such  repairs or  replacement  with
respect to such damage or loss shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee.

         11.5              APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS DURING DEFAULT

         Any amount  described in this ss. 11 that is payable or creditable  to,
or  retainable  by,  Lessee  shall not be paid or credited  to, or retained  by,
Lessee  if a Special  Default  or Event of  Default  exists  when such  payment,
credit, or retention would otherwise occur, but shall instead be held by or paid
over to Lessor as security for Lessee's  obligations under this Lease, and shall
be invested  pursuant  to ss. 4.4 unless and until such  amount is  applied,  at
Lessor's option,  or upon Lessee's written request to Lessor,  from time to time
during the existence of an Event of Default, to Lessee's  obligations under this
Lease  and the  other  Lessee  Operative  Agreements  as and when due (any  such
application to be made to such obligations of Lessee as Lessor determines in its
sole  discretion).  If and when no Special  Default and Event of Default exists,
such  amount  shall be paid to Lessee to the  extent not  previously  applied in
accordance with this ss. 11.5.

                                 12. INSPECTION

         (a) At  all  reasonable  times  Lessor,  Owner  Participant,  or  their
authorized  representatives  (the "INSPECTING  PARTIES") may (not more than once
every 12 months by each such Person, unless an Event of Default exists or during
the last 12 months of the Base Term and any Renewal Term,  then such  inspection
right shall not be so limited) inspect the Aircraft and the Aircraft  Documents,
and any such  Inspecting  Party may make copies of the  Aircraft  Documents  not
reasonably deemed confidential by Lessee or a Permitted Sublessee.

         (b) Any  inspection  of the  Aircraft  hereunder  shall be limited to a
visual,  walk-around inspection that may include going on board the Aircraft and
visually examining the contents of any open panels, bays, or other components of
the  Airframe  or Engines,  but shall not  include  the opening of any  unopened
panels, bays, or other components of the Aircraft,  and no such inspection shall
interfere with Lessee's or any Permitted Sublessee's maintenance or operation of
the Aircraft, the Airframe, or any Engine.

         (c) Lessor and Owner  Participant  shall not have any duty or liability
to make,  or any duty or  liability  by reason of not  making,  any such  visit,
inspection or survey.

         (d) Each  Inspecting  Party shall bear its own  expenses in  connection
with any such  inspection  (including  the cost of any copies made in accordance
with ss. 12(a)), except following an Event of Default, in which case Lessee will
bear the costs of inspection and pay the same on demand.

         (e) Upon Lessor's  request,  during the last 12 months of the Base Term
and any Renewal Term, Lessee will give 10 Business Days' prior written notice to
Lessor and Owner Participant of any scheduled  maintenance checks,  inspections,
surveys,  or  repair  visits.  During  such  period,  Owner  Participant  or its
representative  may attend  any and all such  maintenance  checks,  inspections,
surveys, or repair visits.

                 13. ASSIGNMENT; MERGER; SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEE

         13.1              IN GENERAL

         This Lease and the other  Lessee  Operative  Agreements  shall bind and
benefit Lessor and Lessee and their successors and permitted assigns.  Except as
otherwise  expressly  permitted  by the terms of the  Lease or any other  Lessee
Operative Agreement, Lessee will not, without the prior written consent of Owner
Participant, assign any of its rights under this Lease.

         13.2              MERGER OF LESSEE

                           13.2.1           IN GENERAL

     Lessee  shall not  consolidate  with or merge into any other  Person  under
circumstances  in which  Lessee is not the  surviving  corporation,  or  convey,
transfer,  or lease in one or more  transactions all or substantially all of its
assets to any other Person, unless:

     (a) such Person is organized, existing, and in good standing under the Laws
of the United States,  any state of the United States, or the District Columbia,
and,  upon  consummation  of such  transaction,  such Person will be a U.S.  Air
Carrier;

     (b) such Person  executes  and delivers to Lessor and Owner  Participant  a
duly authorized,  legal, valid, binding, and enforceable  agreement,  reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Owner Participant, containing an effective
assumption by such Person of the due and punctual  performance and observance of
each covenant, agreement, and condition in the Lessee Operative Agreements to be
performed or observed by Lessee;

     (c) such Person makes such filings and recordings  with the FAA pursuant to
the Transportation  Code as shall be necessary to evidence such consolidation or
merger;

     (d) Lessee  furnishes  Lessor and Owner  Participant  an opinion of counsel
reasonably   satisfactory   to  Owner   Participant  to  the  effect  that  such
consolidation  or merger has satisfied at the closing of such  consolidation  or
merger items (a), (b) and (c) above;

     (e) immediately  after giving effect to such  consolidation  or merger,  no
Special Default or Event of Default exists;

         (f) unless Owner  Participant  otherwise  consents,  immediately  after
giving effect to such consolidation or merger,  such Person will have a tangible
net worth of at least  the  lesser of (i) 100% of  Lessee's  tangible  net worth
immediately prior to such  consolidation or merger, and (ii) the greater of (aa)
the tangible net worth of Lessee as of March 31, 2000,  and (bb) 65% of Lessee's
tangible net worth immediately prior to such consolidation or merger; and

         (g) upon such consolidation or merger becoming  effective,  Lessor will
enjoy the same  degree of  protection  under  Section  1110 with  respect to the
Aircraft as Lessor enjoyed prior to such merger.

                           13.2.2           EFFECT OF MERGER

         Upon any such  consolidation  or merger of Lessee with or into,  or the
conveyance,  transfer,  or lease by  Lessee of all or  substantially  all of its
assets to, any Person in accordance with this ss. 13.2, such Person will succeed
to, and be  substituted  for, and may exercise  every right and power of, Lessee
under the Lessee Operative Agreements with the same effect as if such Person had
been named as  "Lessee"  therein.  No such  consolidation,  merger,  conveyance,
transfer, or lease shall have the effect of releasing Lessee or such Person from
any of Lessee's obligations,  liabilities,  covenants, or undertakings under the
Lessee Operative Agreements.

         13.3              SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEE

         If any successor is appointed to serve as Owner Trustee pursuant to the
terms of the  Participation  Agreement and the Trust  Agreement,  such successor
shall,  upon  written  notice by such  successor  to Lessee,  succeed to all the
rights,  powers,  and  title of  Lessor  hereunder,  and  shall be  deemed to be
"Lessor"  and the owner of the Aircraft and the other assets of the Trust Estate
for all purposes hereof,  without the need for any consent or approval by Lessee
and without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or Lessee's  obligations
hereunder.  An appointment and designation of a successor as Owner Trustee shall
not exhaust the right to appoint and designate further  successors or additional
trustees as Owner Trustees pursuant to the Participation Agreement and the Trust
Agreement,  and such  right may be  exercised  repeatedly  as long as this Lease
shall be in effect.

                              14. EVENTS OF DEFAULT

         The  existence  of any  one or  more  of the  following  circumstances,
conditions,  acts,  or events,  for any reason  whatsoever  and whether any such
circumstance,  condition,  act, or event is  voluntary or  involuntary  or comes
about or is effected by  operation of Law or pursuant to or in  compliance  with
any judgment, decree, order, rule, or regulation of any Government Entity, shall
constitute an Event of Default so long as it shall not have been remedied:

fails  to pay any  Supplemental  Rent  (other  than  Stipulated  Loss  Value  or
Termination Value) when due and such failure continues for a period in excess of

Lessor of the failure to make such payment when due.

         14.2              INSURANCE

         Lessee  fails to  observe  or  perform  (or  cause to be  observed  and
performed) in any material respect any other covenant,  agreement, or obligation
of  Lessee  in any  Lessee  Operative  Agreement,  and  such  failure  continues
unremedied  for a period of 30 days from and  after the date of  written  notice
thereof to Lessee (or the  Guarantor,  as the case may be) from  Lessor or Owner
Participant,  unless such  failure is capable of being  corrected  and Lessee is
diligently  proceeding  to  correct  such  failure,  and such  failure  poses no
imminent  and  material  risk  of  Lessor  or  Owner  Participant  losing  their
respective  interests in the Aircraft,  in which case there shall be no Event of
Default unless and until such failure  continues  unremedied for a period of 270
days after  receipt of such  notice;  PROVIDED,  that in all events  Lessee must
remedy  such  failures  within  90  days of  Lessee's  obtaining  access  to the
Aircraft.

         Any  representation  or warranty made by Lessee in any Lessee Operative
Agreement  (other  than  Lessee's  representations  and  warranties  in the  Tax
Indemnity  Agreement)  (a)  proves to have  been  untrue  or  inaccurate  in any
material  respect as of the date made,  (b) is material at the time in question,
and  (c)  remains  uncured  (to  the  extent  of  the  adverse  impact  of  such
incorrectness  on the interest of Owner  Participant  or Lessor) for a period in
excess of 30 days from and after the date of written  notice thereof from Lessor
or Owner Participant to Lessee (or Guarantor, as the case may be); provided that

petition or an answer seeking  reorganization,  liquidation or other relief in a
case under any bankruptcy  Laws or other  insolvency  Laws (as in effect at such
time), or Lessee or Guarantor  seeks relief by voluntary  petition,  answer,  or

property is sequestered,  and any such order, judgment, or decree of appointment
or sequestration  remains in force  undismissed,  unstayed,  and unvacated for a
period of 90 days after the date of entry thereof; or

         (c) a  petition  against  Lessee  or  Guarantor  in a  case  under  any
bankruptcy  Laws or other  insolvency  Laws (as in effect at such time) is filed
and not  withdrawn  or  dismissed  within 90 days  thereafter,  or if, under the
provisions of any Law providing for reorganization or winding-up of corporations
that applies to Lessee or Guarantor, any court of competent jurisdiction assumes
jurisdiction, custody, or control of Lessee or Guarantor or of substantially all
of its  property,  and such  jurisdiction,  custody or control  remains in force
unrelinquished, unstayed, and unterminated for a period of 90 days.

         15.1              REMEDIES

         If any Event of Default  exists,  Lessor  may, at its option and at any
time and from time to time,  exercise any one or more of the following  remedies
as Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect:

                           15.1.1           RETURN AND REPOSSESSION

         Lessor may cause  Lessee,  upon  giving  written  notice to Lessee,  to
return promptly,  and Lessee shall return promptly,  the Airframe and Engines as
Lessor  shall so  demand,  to Lessor or its order in the  manner  and  condition
required by, and otherwise in accordance  with,  all the provisions of ss. 5, as
if the Airframe or Engine were being  returned at the end of the Term or Lessor,
at its option,  may enter upon the premises where the Airframe or any Engine, or
any Part  thereof,  is located and take  immediate  possession of and remove the
same by summary  proceedings  or otherwise,  all without  liability  accruing to
Lessor for or by reason of such entry or taking of  possession,  whether for the
restoration of damage to property caused by such taking or otherwise.

                           15.1.2           SALE AND USE

         Lessor may sell the  Airframe or any Engine at public or private  sale,
at  such  time(s)  and  place(s),   and  to  such  Person(s)   (including  Owner
Participant),  as Lessor  determines;  or Lessor may otherwise dispose of, hold,
use,  operate,  lease to others,  or keep idle the  Airframe or any  Engine,  as
Lessor,  in its sole  discretion,  shall  determine,  all free and  clear of any
rights of Lessee and without any duty to account to Lessee with  respect to such
action  or  inaction  or for  any  proceeds  with  respect  thereto,  except  as
hereinafter  set  forth in this ss.  15,  and  except  to the  extent  that such
proceeds  would  constitute,  under  applicable  Law, a  mitigation  of Lessor's
damages suffered or incurred as a result of the subject Event of Default. Lessor
shall give to Lessee at least 15 days'  prior  written  notice of the date fixed
for any  public  sale of the  Airframe  or any Engine or of the date on or after
which will occur the execution of any contract providing for any private sale.

                           15.1.3           CERTAIN LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

         Whether or not Lessor shall have exercised,  or shall thereafter at any
time exercise,  any of its rights under ss. 15.1.1 or ss. 15.1.2 with respect to
the Airframe or any Engine,  or any Part thereof,  Lessor,  by written notice to
Lessee specifying a payment date (which shall be the first Stipulated Loss Value
Date occurring not less than 10 days after the date of such notice),  may demand
that  Lessee to pay to Lessor,  and Lessee  shall pay to Lessor,  on the payment
date so  specified  and in the manner and in funds of the type  specified in ss.
3.3, as  liquidated  damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu
of the Basic Rent (as  applicable)  for the  Aircraft  in respect of all periods
commencing  on or after the date  specified  for  payment in such  notice),  the
following amounts:

     (a) all unpaid Basic Rent due at any time before the Stipulated  Loss Value
Date specified in such notice; plus

     (b)  whichever of the  following  amounts  Lessor,  in its sole  discretion
specifies in such notice:

                  (1) an  amount  equal to the  excess  (if any) of the  present
         value,  computed as of the Stipulated Loss Value Date specified in such
         notice,  discounted  to such  date  at a rate  equal  to the  SLV  Rate
         compounded   quarterly,   of  all   unpaid   Basic   Rent   during  the
         then-remaining  portion  of the Base  Term (or,  if a Renewal  Term has
         commenced,  of all unpaid  Basic Rent during the  remaining  portion of
         such  Renewal  Term) over the Fair Market  Rental Value of the Aircraft
         for the  remainder  of the Term,  after  discounting  such Fair  Market
         Rental  Value to  present  value (at a rate per annum  equal to the SLV
         Rate,  compounded  quarterly)  as of the  Stipulated  Loss  Value  Date
         specified in such notice, or

                  (2) an amount  equal to the excess (if any) of the  Stipulated
         Loss Value for the Aircraft,  computed as of the Stipulated  Loss Value
         Date specified in such notice,  over the Fair Market Sales Value of the
         Aircraft,  as of the  Stipulated  Loss  Value  Date  specified  in such
         notice; plus

         (c) interest on the amounts  specified in the  foregoing  clause (a) at
the Past-Due  Rate from and  including the date on which any such amount was due
to the date of payment of such amount; plus

         (d) interest on the amount  specified in the foregoing clause (b)(1) or
(b)(2),  according to Lessor's election, at the Past-Due Rate from and including
the  Stipulated  Loss Value Date specified in such notice to the date of payment
of such amount.

                           15.1.4           LIQUIDATED DAMAGES UPON SALE

         If,  pursuant  to ss.  15.1.2 or  applicable  Law,  Lessor has sold the
Airframe or any Engine,  then, in lieu of exercising its rights under ss. 15.1.3
with  respect to the  Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  or any Engine (as  applicable),
Lessor may, if Lessor so elects,  upon giving written  notice to Lessee,  demand
that  Lessee to pay to Lessor,  and Lessee  shall pay to Lessor,  on the date of
such sale and in the manner and in funds of the type  specified  in ss.  3.3, as
liquidated  damages  for loss of a bargain  and not as a penalty (in lieu of the
Basic Rent for the Aircraft in respect of all periods commencing on or after the
date of such sale), the following amounts:

     (a) all unpaid Basic Rent due at any time before the Stipulated  Loss Value
Date on or immediately preceding the date of such sale; plus

     (b) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the Stipulated Loss Value
of the Aircraft,  computed as of the  Stipulated  Loss Value Date referred to in
the foregoing clause (a), over (2) the proceeds of such sale; plus

     (c) if the date of such sale is not a Stipulated Loss Value Date, an amount
equal to interest, at the rate per annum equal to the SLV Rate, on the amount of
Stipulated Loss Value referred to in clause (b)(1) above, from and including the
Stipulated  Loss Value Date referred to in the foregoing  clause (a) to the date
of such sale; plus

     (d) all brokerage  and other  out-of-pocket  fees and expenses  incurred by
Lessor and Owner Participant in connection with such sale; plus

     (e) interest on the amounts  specified in the  foregoing  clause (a) at the
Past-Due  Rate from and  including  the date on which any such amount was due to
the date of payment of such amount; plus

     (f) interest on the sum of the amounts  specified in the foregoing  clauses
(b), (d) and (e) at the Past-Due  Rate from and  including the date of such sale
to the date of payment of such amounts.

                           15.1.5           RESCISSION

         Lessor may (a) at its option, rescind or terminate this Lease as to the
Aircraft,  the Airframe, or any Engine, or any Part thereof, or (b) exercise any
other  right or  remedy  that may be  available  to it under  applicable  Law or
proceed by  appropriate  court  action to enforce the terms hereof or to recover
damages for the breach hereof.

                           15.1.6           OTHER REMEDIES

         In addition to the  foregoing  remedies  (but  without  duplication  of
amounts  otherwise  paid under this ss. 15),  Lessee shall be liable for any and
all unpaid Rent due  hereunder  before,  during,  or after  (except as otherwise
provided  herein) the  exercise  of any of the  foregoing  remedies  and for all
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and other  costs and  expenses  of Lessor and Owner
Participant,  including interest on overdue Rent at the rate as herein provided,
incurred by reason of the  existence  of any Event of Default or the exercise of
Lessor's  remedies  with respect  thereto,  including all  reasonable  costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the return of the Airframe or any Engine in
accordance  with the terms of ss. 5, or in placing the Airframe or any Engine in
the condition and airworthiness required by ss. 5.

         15.2              LIMITATIONS UNDER CRAF

         Notwithstanding  the provisions of ss. 15.1, during any period that the
Aircraft,  the Airframe, or any Engine is subject to CRAF in accordance with the
provisions  of ss. 7.2.3 and in the  possession of the U.S.  Government,  Lessor
shall not, as a result of any Event of Default,  exercise its remedies hereunder
in such manner as to limit  Lessee's  control under this Lease (or any Permitted
Sublessee's control under any Permitted Sublease) of the Aircraft, the Airframe,
or such Engine,  unless  Lessor gives at least 30 days' (or such other period as
may then apply under CRAF) written notice of default  hereunder by registered or
certified  mail to  Lessee  (and  any  Permitted  Sublessee)  with a copy to the
Contracting  Officer  Representative or Representatives for the Military Airlift
Command of the United  States Air Force to whom  notices must be given under the
contract governing Lessee's (or any Permitted Sublessee's) participation in CRAF
with respect to the Aircraft, the Airframe, or any Engine.

         15.3              RIGHT TO PERFORM FOR LESSEE

         If Lessee (a) fails to make any payment of Rent  required to be made by
it  hereunder  or (b)  fails to  perform  or comply  with any of its  agreements
contained  herein and such failure  under this clause (b) continues for a period
of 30 days after the  earlier  of Lessor or Owner  Participant,  giving  written
notice  thereof to  Lessee,  or (c) fails to  maintain  the  insurance  required
hereunder  and such failure  under this clause (c)  continues  for 10 days after
such notice,  then Lessor or Owner  Participant  may (but shall not be obligated
to) make such payment or perform or comply with such  agreement,  and the amount
of such  payment and the amount of the  expenses of Lessor or Owner  Participant
incurred in  connection  with such payment or the  performance  of or compliance
with such  agreement (as  applicable),  together  with  interest  thereon at the
Past-Due Rate, shall be deemed  Supplemental Rent, payable by Lessee upon demand
by Lessor or Owner Participant,  whichever is entitled thereto. No such payment,
performance,  or  compliance  shall be deemed to waive any Default or  otherwise
relieve Lessee of its obligations with respect thereto.

     15.4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET RENTAL VALUE AND FAIR MARKET SALES VALUE

         For the  purpose of this ss. 15, the Fair  Market  Rental  Value or the
Fair Market Sales Value of the Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  or any Engine shall be
determined  on an "as is, where is" basis and shall take into account  customary
brokerage and other  out-of-pocket  fees and expenses which  typically  would be
incurred in connection with a re-lease or sale of such an aircraft, airframe, or
engine. Any such determination shall be made by an Appraiser selected by Lessor,
and the  costs  and  expenses  associated  therewith  shall be borne by  Lessee;
PROVIDED, that, if Lessor does not obtain possession of the Aircraft pursuant to
this ss. 15, an Appraiser  shall not be appointed,  and Fair Market Rental Value
and Fair Market Sales Value for purposes of this ss. 15 shall be zero.

         15.5              REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

         Nothing  contained in this Lease shall be construed to limit in any way
any right,  power,  remedy,  or privilege of Lessor hereunder or under any other
Operative  Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.  Each and
every  right,  power,  remedy,  and  privilege  hereby given to, or retained by,
Lessor in this Lease  shall be in  addition  to and not in  limitation  of every
other right, power,  remedy, and privilege given under the Operative  Agreements
or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.  Each and every right,  power,
remedy,  and  privilege  of Lessor  under  this  Lease  and any other  Operative
Agreement may be exercised from time to time or simultaneously  and as often and
in such order as may be deemed  expedient by Lessor.  All such  rights,  powers,
remedies, and privileges shall be cumulative and not mutually exclusive, and the
exercise of one shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other.
Lessee hereby waives to the extent  permitted by applicable  Law any right which
it may have to require Lessor to choose or elect remedies.

                         16. LESSEE'S OBLIGATIONS; NO SETOFF, COUNTERCLAIM, ETC.

         (a)  Lessee's  obligation  to pay all Rent payable  hereunder  shall be
absolute  and  unconditional,  and  shall  not  be  affected  by  any  event  or
circumstance,  including: (1) any setoff, counterclaim,  recoupment, defense, or
other right that Lessee may have against Lessor, Owner Participant, or any other
Person for any reason  whatsoever;  (2) any defect in the title,  airworthiness,
condition, design, operation, or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or
destruction of, the Aircraft,  the Airframe,  or any Engine, or any interruption
or  cessation  in the  use or  possession  thereof  by  Lessee  for  any  reason
whatsoever;  (3)  any  insolvency,   bankruptcy,   reorganization,   or  similar
proceedings  by or  against  Lessee  or  any  other  Person;  or (4)  any  other
circumstance,  happening, or event whatsoever,  whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

         (b) If for any reason  whatsoever  this Lease  shall be  terminated  in
whole  or in  part by  operation  of law or  otherwise  except  as  specifically
provided herein,  Lessee  nonetheless agrees to pay an amount equal to each Rent
payment at the time such payment would have become due and payable in accordance
with the terms  hereof had this Lease not been  terminated  in whole or in part.
Lessee hereby  waives,  to the extent  permitted by applicable  Law, any and all
rights that it may now have or that at any time  hereafter may be conferred upon
it, by statute or otherwise,  to  terminate,  cancel,  quit,  or surrender  this
Lease, except in accordance with the express terms hereof.

         (c)  Nothing  set forth in this ss. 16 shall be  construed  to prohibit
Lessee  from  separately  pursuing  any claim that it may have from time to time
against  Lessor or any other Person with  respect to any matter  (other than the
absolute and unconditional nature of Lessee's obligations hereunder to pay Rent,
and other than the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) above).

                        17. RENEWAL AND PURCHASE OPTIONS

         17.1              NOTICES GENERALLY

         (a) Unless otherwise  provided by this ss. 17, at least 270 days and no
more than 365 days  before the  Scheduled  Expiration  Date for the Base Term or
then-current  Renewal Term,  Lessee may provide  irrevocable  written  notice to
Lessor  (a  "PRELIMINARY  NOTICE"),   with  a  copy  of  such  notice  to  Owner
Participant,  that Lessee  intends to exercise  the option  either to extend the
leasing of the Aircraft  for a Renewal Term  pursuant to ss. 17.2 or to purchase
the Aircraft on the Scheduled Expiration Date pursuant to ss. 17.3.

         (b) If Lessee gives a Preliminary  Notice,  then Lessee shall provide a
further notice, at least 30 days before the following Scheduled Expiration Date,
specifying  which  option it intends  to elect,  pursuant  to ss.  17.2.1 or ss.
17.3.1 (as applicable).  If Lessee fails to give such further notice at least 30
days before  such  Scheduled  Expiration  Date,  Lessee  shall be deemed to have
elected its option to purchase the Aircraft pursuant to ss. 17.3.1.

         17.2              RENEWAL OPTIONS

                           17.2.1           RENEWAL NOTICE

         (a) If Lessee has given a Preliminary Notice, as specified in ss. 17.1,
and subject to the terms and  conditions  of this ss. 17.2,  Lessee may exercise
its option to extend the leasing of the Aircraft  hereunder  until the following
Scheduled Expiration Date, on the same terms (except as contemplated by this ss.
17) as in the Lessee  Operative  Agreements  with  respect to the Base Term,  by
delivering a notice (a "RENEWAL  NOTICE") to Lessor not less than 30 days before
the Scheduled Expiration Date.

     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Operative Agreement:

                  (1) No  Preliminary  Notice or Renewal Notice shall be binding
         on Lessor  or oblige  Lessor to  extend  the  leasing  of the  Aircraft
         hereunder for a Renewal Term if any Special Default or Event of Default
         exists on and as of the date that such  Renewal  Term  would  otherwise
         commence.

                  (2) A Renewal  Notice  shall be  revocable  by Lessee until 10
         Business Days after the Renewal Rent is  determined in accordance  with
         ss.  17.2.2,  and unless  revoked by written notice by Lessee to Lessor
         shall   thereafter   become   irrevocable   and  shall   constitute  an
         unconditional  obligation  of  Lessee  to  extend  the  leasing  of the
         Aircraft  hereunder  for the Renewal Term to which such Renewal  Notice
         relates.  If Lessee revokes a Renewal Notice as indicated above, Lessee
         will be deemed to have  irrevocably  elected its option to purchase the
         Aircraft pursuant to ss. 17.3.1.

                  (3) Lessee shall not be entitled to give any Renewal Notice if
         it (aa) has not  delivered  a  Preliminary  Notice to Lessor,  (bb) has
         delivered a Purchase Notice to Lessor, or (cc) has previously delivered
         four Renewal Notices to Lessor.

                           17.2.2           RENEWAL RENT

         (a)  During  each  Renewal  Term,  Lessee  shall  pay to Lessor on each
Payment Date,  in the manner and in the funds of the type  specified in ss. 3.3,
Renewal Rent in arrears.

         (b) The Renewal Rent payable by Lessee on each Payment Date during each
Renewal Term shall be the Fixed Rate (or, if less, the Applicable  Percentage of
the Fair  Market  Rental  Value).  Any such Fair  Market  Rental  Value shall be
determined  not more than 120 days and not less than 100 days  before  the first
day of such Renewal Term by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they do
not agree, by an appraisal in accordance with ss. 17.4.

     17.2.3 STIPULATED LOSS AND TERMINATION VALUES

         (a) For any Renewal Term,  Stipulated  Loss Value Dates and Termination
Value Dates shall be extended  throughout such Renewal Term on the same days and
for the same months as during the Base Term.

         (b)  Stipulated  Loss  Value and  Termination  Value  amounts  that are
payable  during any such Renewal Term shall be  determined at the same time that
the  Renewal  Rent  for  such  Renewal  Term is  determined  under  ss.  17.2.2.
Stipulated Loss Values and  Termination  Values for any such Renewal Term shall,
commencing  on the first day of such Renewal  Term,  be equal to the Fair Market
Sales Value of the Aircraft on such day, and shall decline  ratably on a monthly
basis to the salvage  value of the Aircraft as of the last day of its  remaining
useful life.

         (c) For purposes of calculating  Stipulated  Loss Value and Termination
Value  amounts  applicable  during any Renewal  Term,  the  "salvage  value" and
"useful life" shall be determined by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee,  or,
if they do not agree, by an appraisal in accordance with ss. 17.4.

         17.3              PURCHASE OPTIONS

                           17.3.1           PURCHASE NOTICE

     (a) Provided that at the time of such election no Special  Default or Event
of Default exists,  Lessee may,  subject to ss. 17.1 and this ss. 17.3, elect to
purchase the  Aircraft:  (1) on the EBO Date as shown on Schedule 5 at the price
indicated  thereon;  (2) on any Purchase  Date, at a purchase price equal to the
Fair Market Sales Value of the Aircraft computed as of the Purchase Date; or (3)
(aa) on any  Payment  Date  occurring  after  the  Tax  Attribute  Period,  if a
Burdensome  Indemnity  Payment not waived by Owner  Participant shall become due
and owing,  if Lessee did not cause such indemnity with the intent of permitting
such purchase and if such purchase  would  eliminate  such indemnity on a future
basis,  or (bb) on any Payment Date after the EBO Date,  if Lessee has committed
to (but not  commenced) a  Significant  Expenditure,  then (whether as to clause
(aa) or (bb)) at a purchase  price  equal to the  greater of (x) the Fair Market
Sales Value of the Aircraft  computed as of such Payment Date (not including any
portion of the Fair  Market  Sales  Value of the  Aircraft  attributable  to any
Significant Expenditure) and (y) the Termination Value for the Aircraft computed
as of such Payment Date.

     (b) Lessee may exercise such option to purchase the  Aircraft,  by delivery
of a  written  notice  (a  "PURCHASE  NOTICE")  to  Lessor  (with a copy of such
Purchase Notice to Owner Participant) not less than 60 days and no more than 365
days before the EBO Date (for a purchase under ss. 17.3.1(a)(1)),  not less than
30 days and no more than 365 days before the Purchase Date (for a purchase under
ss.  17.3.1(a)(2)),  and not less than 120 days and no more than 365 days before
the Payment Date specified in such Purchase Notice (for a voluntary  termination
purchase under ss. 17.3.1(a)(3)).

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Operative Agreement:

                  (1) Any  Purchase  Notice  delivered  or  deemed  to have been
         delivered pursuant to ss.  17.3.1(a)(1) or (2) shall be irrevocable and
         shall constitute an unconditional  obligation of Lessee to purchase the
         Aircraft  under  this  ss.  17.3;  and any  Purchase  Notice  delivered
         pursuant to ss. 17.3.1(a)(3), shall be revocable until 10 Business Days
         after the  determination  of the Fair Market Sales Value in  accordance
         with ss.  17.3.2,  and unless so revoked by written notice by Lessee to
         Lessor  (with a copy to  Owner  Participant)  shall  thereafter  become
         irrevocable and shall constitute an unconditional  obligation of Lessee
         to purchase the Aircraft under this ss. 17.3.

     (2) Lessee  shall not be entitled to give any Purchase  Notice  pursuant to
ss. 17.3.1(a)(2) if it has not delivered a Preliminary Notice.

     17.3.2 DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET SALES VALUE

         The Fair Market Sales Value of the  Aircraft  shall be  determined  not
more than 120 days and not less than 100 days  before  the  applicable  Purchase
Date or Payment Date by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee, or, if they shall
be unable to agree, by an appraisal in accordance with ss. 17.4.

                           17.3.3   PAYMENTS BY LESSEE

     (a) If Lessee elects to purchase the Aircraft pursuant to clause (1) of ss.
17.3.1(a),  then on the EBO Date  Lessee  shall  pay to  Lessor  in  immediately
available funds:

     (1) all unpaid Basic Rent due before the EBO Date; plus

     (2) the EBO Price; plus

     (3) all Supplemental  Rent then due, and any sales or transfer tax then due
in connection with such purchase.

     (b) If Lessee elects to purchase the Aircraft pursuant to clause (2) of ss.
17.3.1(a),  then on the  applicable  Purchase Date Lessee shall pay to Lessor in
immediately available funds:

     (1) all unpaid Basic Rent due on or before such Purchase Date; plus

     (3) all Supplemental  Rent then due, and any sales or transfer tax then due

                           17.3.4           TITLE

         Upon full and final  payment  by  Lessee of (a) the  applicable  amount
payable under ss. 17.3.3,  (b) on an after-tax basis, all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by Lessor
and Owner  Participant  in connection  with such purchase and invoiced to Lessee
prior  thereto,  and (c) all other  amounts then due and payable by Lessee under
the Operative  Agreements,  Lessor will transfer to Lessee title to the Aircraft
in accordance with ss. 4.5.

                           17.3.5           INSTALLMENT EBO PURCHASE

         Lessee and Lessor  acknowledge that at Lessee's  election the EBO Price
may be payable in  installments  as  provided  in  Schedule 5. Lessor and Lessee
agree  that  if  Lessee  elects  to  purchase  the  Aircraft   pursuant  to  ss.
17.3.1(a)(1) and elects to pay the EBO Price in  installments,  Lessee agrees to
provide security to Lessor to secure the unpaid balance of the EBO Price,  which
security  shall  be  required  to be in an  amount  and  otherwise  in form  and
substance  reasonably  satisfactory to Lessor and Owner Participant.  Subject to
the foregoing,  upon payment of the initial  installment of the EBO Price as set
forth in Schedule 5 together with all amounts  otherwise payable pursuant to ss.
17.3.3(a)  and ss.  17.3.4,  Lessor  will  transfer  title  to the  Aircraft  in
accordance with ss. 4.5.

         17.4              APPRAISALS

         Whenever  Fair Market  Rental  Value or Fair Market  Sales Value of the
Aircraft is required to be determined by an appraisal  under this ss. 17, Lessee
and Lessor  shall  appoint a  mutually-satisfactory  Appraiser  to conduct  such
appraisal.  If Lessee and Lessor  fail to agree upon a  satisfactory  Appraiser,
then each shall promptly appoint a separate Appraiser, and such Appraisers shall
jointly determine such amount. If either Lessee or Lessor does not so appoint an
Appraiser,  the determination of the single Appraiser  appointed shall be final.
If two Appraisers  are appointed and within seven days after the  appointment of
the latter of such two Appraisers,  they do not agree upon such amount, such two
Appraisers  shall,  within eight days after such latter  appointment,  appoint a
third Appraiser,  and such amount shall be determined by such three  Appraisers,
who shall  make their  separate  appraisals  within  seven  days  following  the
appointment  of the third  Appraiser,  and any  determination  so made  shall be
conclusive  and binding  upon Lessor and Lessee.  If no such third  Appraiser is
appointed within such eight-day period, either Lessor or Lessee may apply to the
American  Arbitration  Association  to make such  appointment,  and both parties
shall be bound by such appointment.  The foregoing  appraisal procedure shall in
any event be  completed no less than 125 days before the end of the Base Term or
any Renewal Term (unless such procedure is undertaken in connection  with ss. 15
or ss.  17.3.1(a),  in  which  case it shall be  completed  promptly).  If three
Appraisers are appointed and the difference  between the determination  which is
further from the middle  determination and the middle determination is more than
125%  of  the  difference  between  the  middle   determination  and  the  third
determination,  then such further determination shall be excluded, the remaining
two  determinations  shall be  averaged,  and such  average  shall be final  and
binding   upon  Lessor  and  Lessee.   Otherwise,   the  average  of  all  three
determinations  shall be final and binding upon Lessor and Lessee.  The fees and
expenses of all such  Appraisers  and such  appraisal  procedure  shall be borne
equally by Lessee and Lessor.

                                18. MISCELLANEOUS

         18.1              AMENDMENTS

         No  provision  of this  Lease  may be  amended,  supplemented,  waived,
modified,  discharged,  terminated,  or otherwise varied orally,  but only by an
instrument in writing that  specifically  identifies the provision of this Lease
that it purports to amend, supplement,  waive, modify, discharge,  terminate, or
otherwise  vary and is  signed  by  Lessor  and  Lessee.  Each  such  amendment,
supplement, waiver, modification,  discharge,  termination, or variance shall be
effective only in the specific  instance and for the specific  purpose for which
it is given.  No provision of this Lease shall be varied or contradicted by oral
communication,  course of dealing or performance,  or other manner not set forth
in an  agreement,  document,  or  instrument in writing and signed by Lessor and
Lessee.

         18.2              SEVERABILITY

         If  any   provision   hereof  shall  be  held  invalid,   illegal,   or
unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction,  then, to the extent permitted
by Law, (a) all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in
such  jurisdiction,  and (b) such invalidity,  illegality,  or  unenforceability
shall not affect the validity,  legality, or enforceability of such provision in
any other jurisdiction.  If, however,  any Law pursuant to which such provisions
are held invalid,  illegal,  or unenforceable  may be waived,  Lessor and Lessee
hereby waive such Law to the full extent  permitted,  to the end that this Lease
shall be deemed to be a valid and binding agreement in all respects, enforceable
in accordance with its terms.

         18.3              THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY

         This Lease is not  intended  to  provide,  and shall not  provide,  any
Person not a party hereto (other than Owner Participant and the Persons referred
to in ss. 4.6) with any rights of any nature  whatsoever  against  either of the
parties hereto,  and no Person not a party hereto (other than Owner  Participant
and the  Persons  referred  to in ss.  4.6)  shall  have any  right,  power,  or
privilege in respect of this Lease, or have any benefit or interest  arising out
of this Lease.

         18.4              REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

         This Lease (including all annexes,  schedules, and exhibits hereto) and
all  agreements,  instruments,  and  documents  relating  hereto,  including (a)
consents,  waivers,  and modifications  that may hereafter be executed,  and (b)
financial  statements,   certificates,   and  other  information  previously  or
hereafter  furnished to any party hereto, may be reproduced by such party by any
photographic,  photostatic,  microfilm,  micro-card,  miniature photographic, or
other  similar  process,  and such party may destroy any  original  documents so
reproduced.  Any  such  reproduction  shall be  admissible  in  evidence  as the
original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the
original is in existence and whether or not such  reproduction  was made by such
party in the regular course of business),  and any  enlargement,  facsimile,  or
further reproduction of such reproduction likewise is admissible in evidence.

         18.5              COUNTERPARTS

         This Lease and any amendments, waivers, consents, or supplements hereto
may be executed in any number of counterparts (or upon separate  signature pages
bound together into one or more counterparts),  each fully-executed set of which
when  so  executed  shall  be  deemed  to be  an  original,  and  all  of  which
counterparts,  taken together, shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
single fully-executed  original of this Lease marked "Original" on the signature
page  hereof  is  the  original  for  chattel  paper  purposes,  and  all  other
counterparts   are   duplicates  for  chattel  paper  purposes  and  are  marked
"duplicate" on the signature page hereof. No security interest in this Lease may
be perfected by the possession of any counterpart other than the "Original".

         18.6              NOTICES

         Unless otherwise  expressly permitted by the terms hereof, all notices,
requests,  demands,  authorizations,  directions,  consents,  waivers, and other
communications  required or permitted  to be made,  given,  furnished,  or filed
hereunder shall be made, given, furnished, or filed, and shall become effective,
in the manner prescribed in ss. 15.7 of the Participation Agreement.

         18.7              GOVERNING LAW

         THIS LEASE  SHALL IN ALL  RESPECTS  BE GOVERNED  BY, AND  CONSTRUED  IN
ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,  INCLUDING  ALL MATTERS OF
CONSTRUCTION,  VALIDITY,  AND PERFORMANCE.  THIS LEASE IS BEING DELIVERED IN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

         18.8              NO WAIVER

         No failure on the part of Lessor to exercise, and no delay by Lessor in
exercising,  any of its rights, powers, remedies, or privileges under this Lease
or  provided  at Law,  in  equity  or  otherwise  shall  impair,  prejudice,  or
constitute  a waiver  of any such  right,  power,  remedy,  or  privilege  or be
construed  as a waiver  of any  breach  hereof  or  default  hereunder  or as an
acquiescence  therein,  nor shall any  single or  partial  exercise  of any such
right,  power,  remedy,  or  privilege  preclude  any other or further  exercise
thereof  by Lessor  or the  exercise  of any  other  right,  power,  remedy,  or
privilege by Lessor. No notice to or demand on Lessee in any case shall,  unless
otherwise  required  under this  Lease,  entitle  Lessee to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the
rights of Lessor to any other or  further  action in any  circumstances  without
notice or demand.

         18.9              ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         This Lease, together with the other Operative Agreements,  on and as of
the date hereof  constitute  the entire  agreement  of the  parties  hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof,  and all prior  understandings
or agreements,  whether written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect
to such subject matter are hereby superseded in their entirety.

                                RETURN CONDITIONS

         This Annex B shall apply to the return of the  Aircraft by or on behalf
of Lessee  under the Lease,  whether at a Scheduled  Expiration  Date,  upon the
exercise  of  Lessee's  rights  under ss. 9 of the Lease,  upon the  exercise of
Lessor's remedies following the occurrence of an Event of Default, or otherwise.
However,  this  Annex B shall not apply (1) if an Event of Loss to the  Aircraft
occurs (unless the Aircraft is replaced  under ss. 10.1.3 of the Lease),  or (2)
if Lessee buys the Aircraft in accordance with ss. 17 of the Lease.

         The  terms  defined  in  Annex  A  to  Lease  Agreement  N___AT,   when
capitalized  as in Annex A, have the same  meanings  when  used in this  "Return
Conditions"   Annex.   Annex  A  also  contains  rules  of  usage  that  control

                                     ANNEX C

                                   MAINTENANCE

         The  terms  defined  in  Annex  A  to  Lease  Agreement  N___AT,   when
capitalized   as  in  Annex  A,  have  the  same  meanings  when  used  in  this
"Maintenance"  Annex.  Annex  A  also  contains  rules  of  usage  that  control
construction in this "Maintenance" Annex.

         A.       MAINTENANCE.
                  -----------

         Lessee shall maintain,  service,  repair, and overhaul the Aircraft (or
cause the Aircraft to be  maintained,  serviced,  repaired,  and  overhauled) in
accordance  with  (1)  maintenance   standards  required  by,  or  substantially
equivalent to those required by, the FAA or the central civil aviation authority
of Canada, Japan, and the JAA for the Aircraft (the "MAINTENANCE  PROGRAM"),  so
as (aa) to keep  the  Aircraft  in as good  operating  condition  as  originally
delivered  hereunder,  ordinary  wear  and tear  excepted,  and (bb) to keep the
Aircraft  in  such  operating  condition  as  may be  necessary  to  enable  the
applicable airworthiness certificate for the Aircraft to be maintained under the
regulations of the FAA or other Aviation Authority then having jurisdiction over
the  operation  of the  Aircraft,  other than  during (x)  temporary  periods of
storage  in  accordance  with  applicable   regulations,   (y)  maintenance  and
modification  permitted  hereunder,  and (z) periods  when the FAA or such other
Aviation  Authority has revoked or suspended the airworthiness  certificates for
Similar Aircraft;  and (2) except during periods when a Permitted Sublease is in
effect,  the same  standards as Lessee uses with respect to similar  aircraft of
similar  size in its fleet  operated  by Lessee in  similar  circumstances  and,
during any period in which a Permitted Sublease is in effect, the same standards
used by the Permitted Sublessee with respect to similar aircraft of similar size
in its fleet and operated by the Permitted  Sublessee in similar  circumstances.
Lessee  further  agrees that the Aircraft will be  maintained,  used,  serviced,
repaired,  overhauled,  or inspected in  compliance  with  applicable  Laws with
respect  to  the  maintenance  of  the  Aircraft  and in  compliance  with  each
applicable airworthiness certificate,  license, and registration relating to the
Aircraft  issued by the  Aviation  Authority,  other than minor or  nonrecurring
violations  with respect to which  corrective  measures are taken upon discovery
thereof and except to the extent Lessee or Permitted  Sublessee is contesting in
good faith the validity or application  of any such Law or requirement  relating
to any such certificate, license, or registration in any reasonable manner which
does not create a material  risk of sale,  loss,  or forfeiture of the Aircraft,
the Airframe,  or any Engine or the interest of Owner  Participant  therein or a
material risk of criminal  liability or material civil penalty against Lessor or
Owner Participant. Lessee shall cause the Aircraft Documents to be maintained in
English and  promptly  furnish  Lessor and Owner  Participant  with  information
necessary for filing with applicable governmental aviation authorities.

         B.       REPLACEMENT OF PARTS.
                  --------------------

         Except as otherwise  provided herein,  Lessee will promptly replace (or
cause to be  replaced)  all  Parts  that are from time to time  incorporated  or
installed  in or attached  to the  Aircraft,  and that  become  worn out,  lost,
stolen, destroyed,  seized,  confiscated,  damaged beyond repair, or permanently
rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, Lessee may remove
(or  permit to be  removed)  any Parts in the  ordinary  course of  maintenance,
service,  repair,  overhaul, or testing, whether or not such Parts are worn out,
lost,  stolen,  destroyed,  seized,  confiscated,   damaged  beyond  repair,  or
permanently rendered unfit for use; PROVIDED, that, except as otherwise provided
herein,  Lessee will replace or cause the  replacement of such Parts as promptly
as  practicable.  All  replacement  Parts  shall be free and clear of all Liens,
except for Permitted Liens and pooling  arrangements to the extent  permitted by
ss. C below and shall be in good operating  condition and (except in the case of
replacement  property  installed on the basis of operational  exigencies) have a
value and  utility  not less than the value and  utility  of the Parts  replaced
(assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition  required under this Lease).
Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  all Parts at any time  removed from the
Aircraft  shall remain the property of Lessor,  no matter where  located,  until
they are  replaced  by Parts  that have been  incorporated  or  installed  in or
attached to the Aircraft and that meet the  requirements  for replacement  Parts
specified  above. As soon as a replacement  Part is incorporated or installed in
or attached to the Aircraft as above provided, without further act, (1) title to
the  replaced  Part shall vest in Lessee (or if a Permitted  Sublease is then in
effect,  in the Permitted  Sublessee) free and clear of all Lessor Liens and all
rights  of  Lessor,  and the  replaced  Part  shall no  longer  be deemed a Part
hereunder, (2) title to such replacement Part shall vest in Lessor, subject only
to Permitted  Liens and pooling  arrangements  to the extent  permitted by ss. C
below and except in the case of replacement property temporarily installed on an
emergency  basis,  and (3) such  replacement  Part shall become  subject to this
Lease and be deemed part of the Aircraft for all purposes  hereof and thereof to
the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to such Aircraft.

         C.       POOLING OF PARTS.
                  ----------------

         Any Part  removed  from the  Aircraft  may be  subjected by Lessee or a
Permitted  Sublessee to a normal  pooling  arrangement  customary in the airline
industry and entered  into in the ordinary  course of business of Lessee or such
Permitted  Sublessee,  so long as a Part  replacing  such  removed Part shall be
incorporated  or installed in or attached to the Aircraft in accordance with ss.
B of this Annex C as promptly as  practicable  after the removal of such removed
Part. In addition,  any  replacement  Part when  incorporated or installed in or
attached  to the  Aircraft  may be owned by any third  party  subject  to such a
normal  pooling  arrangement,  so long as  Lessee  or  Permitted  Sublessee,  as
promptly  thereafter  as  reasonably  possible,  either (1) causes title to such
replacement  Part to vest in Lessor in  accordance  with ss. B of this  Annex C,
free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens), or (2) replaces (or causes
to be replaced)  such  replacement  Part by  incorporating  or  installing in or
attaching  to the  Aircraft  a  further  replacement  Part  owned by Lessee or a
Permitted  Sublessee free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens) and by
causing title to such further  replacement  Part to vest in Lessor in accordance
with ss. B of this Annex C.

         D.       ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS, AND ADDITIONS.
                  -----------------------------------------

         Lessee  shall  make  (or  cause  to  be  made)  such   alterations  and
modifications  in and  additions to the Aircraft as may be required from time to
time to meet the  applicable  standards of the FAA or other  Aviation  Authority
having  jurisdiction  over the  operation  of the  Aircraft,  to the extent made
mandatory in respect of the  Aircraft (a  "MANDATORY  MODIFICATION");  PROVIDED,
that Lessee or any  Permitted  Sublessee  may, in good faith and by  appropriate
procedure,  contest the validity or application of any law, rule, regulation, or
order in any  reasonable  manner which does not have more than a DE MINIMIS risk
of adversely  affecting  Lessor's  interest in the Aircraft and does not involve
more than a DE MINIMIS risk of sale, forfeiture,  or loss of the Aircraft or the
interest of Owner Participant  therein,  more than a DE MINIMIS risk of material
civil  penalty,  or any risk of criminal  liability  being  imposed on Lessor or
Owner  Participant.  In  addition,  Lessee  may make or  permit  to be made such
alterations  and  modifications  in and  additions  to  the  Aircraft  (each  an
"OPTIONAL MODIFICATION") as Lessee or any Permitted Sublessee deems desirable in
the proper  conduct of its  business,  including  removal of Parts which  Lessee
deems are obsolete or no longer  suitable or appropriate for use in the Aircraft
(PROVIDED, that Lessee's right to remove obsolete Parts will be limited to Parts
having an  aggregate  original  cost not  exceeding  1% of Lessor's  Cost of the
Aircraft  with Lessor having the right to request such parts be shipped to Owner
Participant upon removal at Lessee's  expense;  PROVIDED,  that no such Optional
Modification shall (1) diminish the fair market value, estimated residual value,
utility,  or economic  useful life of the  Aircraft or any Engine below its fair
market  value,  estimated  residual  value,  utility,  or  economic  useful life
immediately  before such  Optional  Modification  (assuming the Aircraft or such
Engine  was in the  condition  required  by the Lease  immediately  before  such
Optional  Modification),  (2) cause the Aircraft to cease to have the applicable
standard airworthiness certificate, or (3) cause the Aircraft to become "limited
use  property"  within the  meaning of Rev.  Proc.  79-48.  Except as  otherwise
provided  herein,  title to all Parts  (other than  Removable  Parts (as defined
below))  incorporated  or installed in or attached to the Aircraft as the result
of such Optional  Modification  shall,  without  further act, vest in Lessor and
become subject to this Lease.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this
ss. D, Lessee or a Permitted  Sublessee may, at any time during the Term, remove
any Part (such Part being referred to herein as a "REMOVABLE PART") if (aa) such
Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or substitution  for, any Part
originally  incorporated or installed in or attached to the Aircraft at the time
of delivery  thereof to Lessee or any Part in  replacement  of, or  substitution
for,  any such  Part,  (bb)  such Part is not  required  to be  incorporated  or
installed in or attached to the Aircraft  pursuant to the terms of ss. A of this
Annex C or the  first  sentence  of this ss. D or  pursuant  to the terms of any
insurance  policies  required to be carried hereunder or any applicable law, and
(cc)  such Part can be  removed  from the  Airframe  or  Engine  without  in any
material respect  diminishing the fair market value,  estimated  residual value,
utility,  or  remaining  economic  useful life that the Airframe or Engine would
have had at the time of removal had such  removal not  occurred,  assuming  that
such  Airframe  or  Engine  was in  the  condition  and  repair  required  to be
maintained by the terms hereof and such Removable Part had not been incorporated
or installed in or attached to the Aircraft.  Removable Parts may be leased from
or financed by third  parties  other than Lessor.  Title to any  Removable  Part
shall not vest in Lessor;  except that any Part not removed before the return to
Lessor  hereunder  of the  Airframe  or  Engine  on  which  it is  incorporated,
installed, or attached shall become the property of Lessor.

         E.       RECORDS.
                  -------

         Lessee  shall  maintain  (or  cause  to  be  maintained)  all  Aircraft
Documents. All Aircraft Documents that are specific to the Aircraft shall be the
property  of Lessor,  but shall  become the  property  of Lessee  upon  Lessee's
purchase  of the  Aircraft  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Lease  or upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss and Lessee's compliance with ss. 10.

                                     ANNEX D

                                    INSURANCE

         The  terms  defined  in  Annex  A  to  Lease  Agreement  N___AT,   when
capitalized as in Annex A, have the same meanings when used in this  "Insurance"
Annex.  Annex A also contains rules of usage that control  construction  in this
"Insurance" Annex.

A.       LIABILITY INSURANCE

         1. Except as provided in ss. A2 below, Lessee will carry or cause to be
carried  at  all  times,   at  no  expense  to  Lessor  or  Owner   Participant,
comprehensive  airline legal liability (including passenger liability,  property
damage, and contractual  liability insurance) with respect to the Aircraft which
is (a) in an amount not less than the greater of (x) the amount of comprehensive
airline legal liability insurance from time to time applicable to aircraft owned
or leased  and  operated  by Lessee of the same type and  operating  on  similar
routes as the  Aircraft,  and (y) the  Minimum  Liability  Insurance  Amount per
occurrence;  (b) of the type and  covering  the same  risks as from time to time
applicable to aircraft,  operated by Lessee and similarly-situated  carriers, of
the same type as the  Aircraft;  and (c)  maintained  in effect with insurers of
internationally recognized responsibility in the international aviation industry
(such insurers being referred to herein as "APPROVED INSURERS").

         2.  During any  period  that the  Aircraft  is on the ground and not in
operation,  Lessee may carry or cause to be  carried,  in lieu of the  insurance
required by ss. A1 above,  insurance otherwise conforming with the provisions of
ss. A1 except that (a) the  amounts of coverage  shall not be required to exceed
the amounts of public  liability and property damage insurance from time to time
applicable  to  aircraft  owned or  operated  by  Lessee of the same type as the
Aircraft which are on the ground and not in operation,  and (b) the scope of the
risks  covered and the type of insurance  shall be the same as from time to time
shall be  applicable  to  aircraft  owned or operated by Lessee of the same type
which are on the ground and not in operation.

B.       HULL INSURANCE

         1. Except as provided in ss. B2 below, Lessee will carry or cause to be
carried  at all  times,  at no  expense  to  Lessor or Owner  Participant,  with
Approved Insurers  "all-risk" ground and flight aircraft hull insurance covering
the Aircraft  (including  the Engines when they are installed on the Airframe or
any  other  airframe)  which is of the type as from time to time  applicable  to
aircraft  operated  by  Lessee of the same  type as the  Aircraft  for an amount
denominated in United States Dollars not less than the Stipulated  Loss Value of
the Aircraft

         Any  policies  of  insurance  carried  in  accordance  with this ss. B1
covering the Aircraft and any policies taken out in  substitution or replacement
for any such policies  shall  provide that (a) in the event of a loss  involving
proceeds in excess of the Threshold Amount, the proceeds in respect of such loss
up to an amount equal to the  Stipulated  Loss Value for the  Aircraft  shall be
payable  to  Lessor,  except  in the case of a loss  with  respect  to an Engine
installed on an airframe  other than the Airframe,  in which case Lessee (or any
Permitted  Sublessee)  shall  endeavor to arrange  for any payment of  insurance
proceeds in respect of such loss to be held for the  account of Lessor,  whether
such payment is made to Lessee (or any  Permitted  Sublessee) or any third party
[and, if or Lessor receives such a payment otherwise than in respect of an Event
of Loss, then, upon receipt of evidence  reasonably  satisfactory to Lessor that
the damage giving rise to such payment has been repaired or that such payment is
then required to pay for repairs then being made, Lessor shall pay the amount of
such  payment to Lessee or its  order],  and (b) the  entire  amount of any loss
involving proceeds of the Threshold Amount or less or the amount of any proceeds
of any loss in excess of the  Stipulated  Loss Value for the  Aircraft  shall be
paid to Lessee or its order  unless an Event of Default  exists and the insurers
have been notified  thereof by Lessor.  In the case of a loss with respect to an
engine (other than an Engine)  installed on the Airframe,  Lessor shall hold any
payment to it of any insurance  proceeds for that loss for the account of Lessee
or any other third party who is entitled to receive such proceeds.

         2.  During any  period  that the  Aircraft  is on the ground and not in
operation,  Lessee may carry or cause to be  carried,  in lieu of the  insurance
required by ss. B1 above,  insurance otherwise conforming with the provisions of
ss. B1,  except that the scope of the risks and the type of  insurance  shall be
the same as from time to time applicable to aircraft owned by Lessee of the same
type similarly on the ground and not in operation,  PROVIDED,  that Lessee shall
maintain  insurance  against risk of loss or damage to the Aircraft in an amount
equal to the Stipulated  Loss Value of the Aircraft  during such period that the
Aircraft is on the ground and not in operation.

C.       WAR-RISK, HIJACKING, AND ALLIED PERILS INSURANCE

         If Lessee (or any Permitted  Sublessee) operates or proposes to operate
the  Aircraft,  the  Airframe,  or any  Engine  (1) in any  area  of  recognized
hostilities,  or (2) on  international  routes  and  Lessee  (or such  Permitted
Sublessee) maintains war-risk,  hijacking,  or allied perils insurance for other
aircraft that it operates on such routes or in such areas, Lessee shall maintain
or cause to be maintained  war-risk,  hijacking,  and allied perils insurance of
substantially  the same type carried by similar  United  States  commercial  air
carriers  operating the same or comparable  models of aircraft on similar routes
or in such  areas,  and in no event in an amount less than the  Stipulated  Loss
Value.

D.       GENERAL PROVISIONS

         Any policies of insurance  carried in accordance  with ss.ss. A, B, and
C, including any policies  taken out in  substitution  or  replacement  for such
policies:

     (1) shall name Lessor and Owner  Participant  (and in respect of  liability
insurances,  to the extent they are available  without  unreimbursed  additional
cost to Lessee, each of their respective successors, assigns, directors, agents,
officers, and employees) as additional insureds (the "ADDITIONAL INSUREDS"),  as
their interests may appear;

     (2)  shall  apply  worldwide  and  have  no  territorial   restrictions  or
limitations  (except  only in the  case of war,  hijacking,  and  allied  perils
insurance  required  under  ss.  C,  which  shall  apply to the  fullest  extent
available in the international insurance market);

     (3) shall  provide  that,  in respect of the  interests  of the  Additional
Insureds in such policies, the insurance shall not be invalidated or impaired by
any act or omission  (including  misrepresentation  and nondisclosure) by Lessee
(or any  Permitted  Sublessee)  or any other Person  (including  use for illegal
purposes  of the  Aircraft  or any  Engine),  and shall  insure  the  Additional
Insureds regardless of any breach or violation of any representation,  warranty,
declaration,  term,  or condition  contained in such  policies by Lessee (or any
Permitted Sublessee);

     (4) shall  provide  that,  if the insurers  cancel such  insurance  for any
reason whatsoever, or if it is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, or if
any  material  change  is made in the  insurance  which  adversely  affects  the
interest of any of the Additional Insureds, such cancellation,  lapse, or change
shall not be effective as to the Additional  Insureds for 30 days (seven days in
the case of war risk,  hijacking,  and allied perils insurance) after receipt by
the Additional Insureds of written notice by such insurers of such cancellation,
lapse or change,  PROVIDED,  that if any notice  period  specified  above is not
reasonably obtainable, such policies shall provide for as long a period of prior
notice as shall then be reasonably obtainable;

     (5) shall waive any rights of recourse,  subrogation, setoff (including for
unpaid  premiums),  recoupment,  counterclaim,  or other  deduction,  whether by
attachment or otherwise, against each Additional Insured;

     (6) shall be primary without right of contribution from any other insurance
that may be available to any Additional Insured;

     (7) shall provide that all of the liability  insurance  provisions thereof,
except the limits of  liability,  shall operate in all respects as if a separate
policy had been issued covering each party insured thereunder;

     (8) shall provide that none of the Additional  Insureds shall be liable for
any insurance premium; and

     (9)  shall  contain  a 50/50  Clause  per  Lloyd's  Aviation  Underwriters'
Association Standard Policy Form AVS 103;

     PROVIDED,  that any such  endorsements may be subject to any limitations on
endorsements  generally  prevailing in the airline insurance  marketplace at the
time (E.G., AVN67B).

E.       REPORTS AND CERTIFICATES; OTHER INFORMATION

         On or before the  Delivery  Date and on or before each  renewal date of
the insurance  policies required  hereunder (and no less often than on an annual
basis),  Lessee  will  furnish  or cause to be  furnished  to  Lessor  and Owner
Participant insurance certificates describing in reasonable detail the insurance
maintained hereunder and a report, signed by Lessee's or a Permitted Sublessee's
regular  independent  insurance  broker (the  "INSURANCE  BROKER"),  stating the
opinion of such  Insurance  Broker that (1) all premiums for the insurance  then
due have been paid, and (2) such insurance complies with the terms of this Annex
D. To the extent that such agreement is reasonably obtainable,  Lessee will also
cause the Insurance  Broker to agree to notify Lessor and Owner  Participant  in
writing of any  default in the  payment of any  premium  and of any other act or
omission on the part of Lessee of which the  Insurance  Broker has knowledge and
which  might  invalidate  or  render  unenforceable,  in whole  or in part,  any
insurance on the Aircraft or Engines or cause the cancellation or termination of
such insurance,  and to notify Lessor and Owner  Participant in writing at least
30 days (seven days for war-risk  and allied  perils  coverage,  or such shorter
period therefor as may be available in the  international  insurance  market, as
applicable) before the cancellation,  lapse, or materially adverse change of any
insurance maintained pursuant to this Annex D.

F.       RIGHT TO PAY PREMIUMS

         Each  Additional  Insured shall have the rights but not the obligations
of an additional named insured.  No Additional Insured shall have any obligation
to pay any premium,  commission,  assessment,  or call due on any such insurance
(including  reinsurance).   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  of
cancellation of any required insurance due to the nonpayment of premium, each of
Lessor and Owner Participant  shall have the option, in its sole discretion,  to
pay any  such  premium  and to  maintain  such  coverage,  as  Lessor  or  Owner
Participant may require,  until the scheduled expiry date of such insurance and,
in such event, Lessee shall, upon demand,  reimburse Lessor or Owner Participant
for amounts that they so pay.

G.       DEDUCTIBLES; SELF-INSURANCE

         Lessee  may  self-insure  by way  of  deductible,  premium  adjustment,
franchise  provisions,  or  otherwise  (including,  with  respect  to  insurance
maintained  pursuant to ss. B, insuring for a maximum  amount which is less than
