change occurring after the Effective Date in GAAP or in the application thereof
on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower that the Required Lenders request an

                                       30

<PAGE>

amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any
such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application
thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in
effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective
until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in
accordance herewith.

                  (b) Any accounting or financial determination to be made in
respect of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties on a consolidated basis
shall be made excluding the accounts of the Excluded Subsidiaries that would
otherwise be consolidated therewith in accordance with GAAP.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   The Credits

                  SECTION 2.01. Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the
Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period in an
aggregate principal amount that will not result in such Lender's Revolving
Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment. Within the foregoing
limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower
may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

                  (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and
in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, each Lender having a Tranche D
Commitment made (or exchanged Tranche C Term Loans for) Tranche D Term Loans to
the Borrower on the Restatement Effective Date in a principal amount equal to
its Tranche D Commitment. Amounts repaid in respect of Term Loans may not be
reborrowed. All Tranche A Term Loans, Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Restatement Effective
Date shall remain outstanding hereunder on the terms set forth herein.

                  SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan shall be
made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the
applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made
by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

                  (b) Subject to Section 2.13, each Revolving Borrowing and Term
Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the
Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make
any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of
such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall
not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

                                       31

<PAGE>

                  (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time that
each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount that is an integral multiple of $250,000 and not less than $500,000;
provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is
equal to the entire unused balance of the total Revolving Commitments or that is
required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by
Section 2.04(e). Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding
at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total
of fifteen Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Revolving Maturity Date, Tranche A Maturity Date or Tranche D Maturity
Date, as applicable.

                  SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving
Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by
telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed
Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic
Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each
such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following
information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                           (i) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

                           (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
                  Business Day;

                           (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR
                  Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;

                           (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
                  initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall
                  be a period contemplated by the definition of the term
                  "Interest Period"; and

                           (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account
                  to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with
                  the requirements of Section 2.05.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed
to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each

                                       32

<PAGE>

Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made
as part of the requested Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.04. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Revolving Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions
of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to
any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                  (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date
of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended,
renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the
amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or
extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower
also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard
form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed
$25,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total
Revolving Commitments.

                  (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the
date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

                  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or
an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without
any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing
Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and

                                       33

<PAGE>

unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as
provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than $500,000, the Borrower may, subject to
the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section
2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to
make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such
Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of
such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its
Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same
manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving
Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that
Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their
interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the
funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a
Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

                                       34

<PAGE>

                  (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

                                       35

<PAGE>

                  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the
Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

                  (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
a majority of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. The Borrower also shall
deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required
by Section 2.10(b). Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent
as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's
risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if

                                       36

<PAGE>

any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving
Lenders with LC Exposure representing a majority of the total LC Exposure), be
applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been
cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b), such amount (to the extent not
applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the extent
that, after giving effect to such return, the Borrower would remain in
compliance with Section 2.10(b) and no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

                  SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall
make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to
the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in
New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

                  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing
and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period

                                       37

<PAGE>

as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in
the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as
provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect
to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                           (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election
                  Request applies and, if different options are being elected
                  with respect to different portions thereof, the portions
                  thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which
                  case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii)
                  and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
                  Borrowing);

                           (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant
                  to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business
                  Day;

                           (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
                  Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                           (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar
                  Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
                  giving effect to such election, which shall be a period
                  contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable

                                       38

<PAGE>

thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of
such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing
with an Interest Period of one month. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  SECTION 2.07. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)
Unless previously terminated, (i) the Tranche D Commitments shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Restatement Effective Date and (ii) the
Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any
concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10,
the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

                  (d) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of
this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments
shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Revolving Commitments.

                  (e) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Tranche A
Commitments and Tranche B Commitments have terminated.

                  SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date and (ii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.09.

                  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be, absent manifest error, prima
facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it
be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if

                                       40

<PAGE>

requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

                  SECTION 2.09. Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to
adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Borrower shall repay
Tranche A Term Borrowings on each date set forth below in the aggregate
principal amount equal to the product of (i) $112,500,000 multiplied by (ii) the
percentage set forth opposite such date:

                  (c) To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Tranche A Term
Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Maturity Date and (ii) all
Tranche D Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche D Maturity Date.

                  (d) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing of either Class shall
be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Borrowings
of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section ratably.

                  (e) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings of either
Class hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the
applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 12:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such
repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term Borrowings shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.

                  SECTION 2.10 Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have
the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or
in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

                  (b) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the
Revolving Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall
prepay Revolving Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit
cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
2.04(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

                                       42

<PAGE>

                  (c) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds
are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party in
respect of any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, immediately after such Net
Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings in accordance with paragraph (e)
below in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Proceeds; provided that, in the
case of any event described in clause (a) of the definition of the term
Prepayment Event, if the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a
certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that the Borrower and the
Subsidiary Loan Parties intend to apply the Net Proceeds from such event (or a
portion thereof specified in such certificate) (such Net Proceeds or portion
thereof, the "Reinvestment Amount"), within 360 days after receipt of such Net
Proceeds, to acquire real property, equipment or other tangible assets to be
used in the business of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties, and
certifying that no Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment
shall be required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in
respect of such event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such
certificate, if applicable) except to the extent of any such Net Proceeds
therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of such 360-day period, at
which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to such Net
Proceeds that have not been so applied.

                  (d) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower,
commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003, the Borrower shall
prepay Term Borrowings in accordance with paragraph (e) below in an aggregate
amount equal to 50% or, if the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 5.00 to 1.00 on
the last day of such fiscal year, 25% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year.
Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the date
on which financial statements are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with
respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and
in any event within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

                  (e) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of
Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to
be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section. In the event of any optional or
mandatory prepayment of Term Borrowings made at a time when Term Borrowings of
both Classes remain outstanding, the Borrower shall select Term Borrowings to be
prepaid so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated between the
Tranche A Term Borrowings and Tranche D Term Borrowings pro rata based on the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Borrowings of each such Class,
provided that any Tranche D Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative
Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) at least one Business Day prior to
the prepayment date, to decline all or any portion of any prepayment of its
Tranche D Term Loans pursuant to this Section (other than an optional prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, which may not be declined), in which
case the aggregate amount of the prepayment that would have been applied to
prepay Tranche D Term Loans but was so declined shall be applied to prepay
Tranche A Term Borrowings. The rights of the Tranche D Lenders under this
Section 2.10(e) shall not be changed without the written consent of the Tranche
D Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Tranche D Term Loans.

                                       43

<PAGE>

                  (f) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory
prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment;
provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a
conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated
by Section 2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of
termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly following
receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the
same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the
required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall
be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

                  SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee,
which shall accrue at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily unused amount
of each Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment
terminates. Commitment fees accrued through and including the last day of March,
June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business
Day following such last day, commencing on the third Business Day following June
30, 2002; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate. All commitment fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of
computing commitment fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving
Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the
outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender.

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving
Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on
which such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such
Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a
fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average
daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from

                                       44

<PAGE>

and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to
be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to
the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued
through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of
each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day,
commencing on the third Business Day following June 30, 2002; provided that all
such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after
demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon in writing between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
due and owing hereunder and paid shall not be refundable under any
circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR
Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of
this Section.

                  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving
Availability Period), accrued interest on the

                                       45

<PAGE>

principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.

                  (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.13 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans
included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.14 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
                  special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
                  deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
                  any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in
                  the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                           (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
                  London interbank market any other condition affecting this
                  Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any
                  Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in,

issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's
or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions
incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

                  SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under Section 2.10(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or

                                       47

<PAGE>

(d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate
each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the
case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be
deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount
of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such
Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

                  SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

                                       48

<PAGE>

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender
has received written notice from the Borrower advising it of the availability of
such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

                  (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its
sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay
over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the
request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount
paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed
by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed
to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

                  SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing
of Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14,
2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or
under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as
expressly provided

                                       49

<PAGE>

herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03
shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to
other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion
of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by
any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, Term
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld and (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or

                                       51

<PAGE>
the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts). A Lender shall not be required
to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a
waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                  SECTION 2.19. Incremental Facilities. The Borrower may at any
time and from time to time prior to April 30, 2006, by notice to the
Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver
a copy to each of the Lenders), request the addition of one or more new credit
facilities (the "Incremental Facilities") consisting of a new tranche of term
loans (an "Incremental Term Facility") or a new tranche of revolving loans (an
"Incremental Revolving Facility") or a combination thereof; provided that at the
time of any such request and upon the effectiveness of the Incremental Facility
Amendment referred to below, no Default shall exist and the Borrower shall be in
compliance with Sections 6.13, 6.14, 6.15 and 6.16, determined on a pro forma
basis as if such Incremental Facility had been outstanding on the last day of
the most recent fiscal quarter for testing compliance therewith. The Incremental
Facilities shall be in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding (in the
aggregate) $150,000,000, and each Incremental Facility shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not less than $50,000,000. Each Incremental Facility (a) shall
rank pari passu in right of payment and of security with the Revolving Loans and
the Term Loans, (b) shall not mature earlier than six months after the Tranche D
Maturity Date (but may, subject to clause (c) below, have amortization and
commitment reductions prior to such date), (c) shall have a weighted average
life that is longer than that of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Tranche A
Term Loans and the Tranche D Term Loans, taken as a whole, and (d) for purposes
of prepayments, shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no
more favorably than) the Term Loans, in the case of an Incremental Term
Facility, or the Revolving Loans, in the case of an Incremental Revolving
Facility; provided that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to any
Incremental Facility maturing after the Tranche D Maturity Date may provide for
material additional or different financial or other covenants applicable only
during periods after the Tranche D Maturity Date and (ii) the Incremental
Facilities may be priced differently than the Term Loans and the Revolving
Loans. Any such notice shall set forth the requested amount and terms of the
relevant Incremental Facility. The Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or
other financial institutions, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (any such bank or other financial
institution being called an "Additional Lender"), to extend commitments under
the Incremental Facility, and each existing Lender shall be afforded an
opportunity, but shall not be required, to provide a portion of any such
Incremental Facility. Commitments in respect of Incremental Facilities shall
become Commitments under this Agreement, and each Additional Lender shall become
a Lender under this Agreement, pursuant to an amendment (an "Incremental
Facility Amendment") to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan
Documents, executed by the Borrower, each existing Lender agreeing to provide
such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative
Agent. An Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any other
Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent,
to effect the provisions of this Section. The effectiveness of any Incremental

                                       52

<PAGE>

Facility Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of
each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (it being understood that all
references to "the date of such Borrowing" in such Section 4.02 shall be deemed
to refer to the effective date of such Incremental Facility Amendment). The
proceeds of the Incremental Facilities will be used for general corporate
purposes, including consideration for Permitted Acquisitions.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

                  The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

                  SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

                  SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions
to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate
powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if
required, stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which
any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party,
will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or such
Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

                  SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority (including the
FCC), except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and
effect and (ii) filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan
Documents, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter,
by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiary Loan Parties or any order of any Governmental Authority (including
the FCC), (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture,
agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or give rise to a right
thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiary Loan Parties, except Liens
created under the Loan Documents.

                                       53

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.
(a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated
balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows (i)
as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, reported on by KPMG,
independent public accountants and (ii) as of and for the portion of the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2003, certified by its chief financial officer. Such
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period in accordance with
GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the
case of statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

                  (b) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003, prepared giving
effect to the Restatement Transactions as if the Restatement Transactions had
occurred on such date. Such pro forma consolidated balance sheet (i) has been
prepared in good faith based on the same assumptions used to prepare the pro
forma financial statements included in the Information Memorandum (which
assumptions are believed by the Borrower to be reasonable), (ii) is based on the
best information available to the Borrower after due inquiry and (iii)
accurately reflects all adjustments necessary to give effect to the Restatement
Transactions.

                  (c) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred
to above or the notes thereto or in the Information Memorandum and except for
the Disclosed Matters, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries has, as of the Restatement Effective Date, any
material contingent liabilities, unusual long-term commitments or material
unrealized losses.

                  (d) Since December 31, 2002, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, assets, operations or condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  SECTION 3.05. Properties and Licenses. (a) Each of the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties has good title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all its real and personal property material to its business
(including its Mortgaged Properties), except for minor defects in title that do
not interfere with its ability to conduct, in all material respects, its
business as currently conducted or to utilize, in all material respects, such
properties for their intended purposes.

                  (b) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties owns,
or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties does not infringe upon the rights of
any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                                       54

<PAGE>

                  (c) Schedule 3.05(c) sets forth the address of each real
property that is owned or leased by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiary Loan
Parties as of the Restatement Effective Date after giving effect to the
Restatement Transactions.

                  (d) Schedule 3.05(d) sets forth all FCC Licenses existing as
of the Restatement Effective Date (and the respective holders of such FCC
Licenses) and all other licenses and permits in effect as of the Restatement
Effective Date that are material to the business of the Borrower and the
Subsidiary Loan Parties. Each of the FCC Licenses, and each other license or
permit that is material to the business of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan
Parties, is valid and in full force and effect, and the Borrower and the
Subsidiary Loan Parties are in compliance in all material respects with the
terms and conditions thereof. The Borrower has the right to utilize all FCC
Licenses held by the License Subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There
are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority (including the FCC) pending against or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other
than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or
the Transactions.

                  (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect
to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (or, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv)
below, no director, executive, financial, legal or other officer (including
Financial Officer) or general counsel of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries) (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain,
maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii)
has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or
(iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

                  (c) Since the Restatement Effective Date, there has been no
change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. (a) Each of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations
and orders of any Governmental Authority (including the FCC) applicable to it or
its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon
it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  (b) The Borrower is permitted under each of the 2008
Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Subordinated Exchange Debenture Indenture and
the Series A Preferred Certificate of Designation to incur the Indebtedness
incurred hereunder in respect of the Loans and Letters of Credit.

                  SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither
the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiary Loan Parties is (a) an "investment
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

                  SECTION 3.09. Tax Matters. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports
required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required
to have been paid by it, except (i) any Taxes that are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary,
as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii) to the
extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used
for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as
of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,
exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan by a material amount,
and the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded
Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of
the assets of all such underfunded Plans by a material amount.

                  SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the
Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it,
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the
other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished
by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented by other
information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that,
with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only
that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed
to be reasonable at the time.

                  SECTION 3.12. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name
of, and the ownership interest of the Borrower in, each Subsidiary of the
Borrower and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each
case as of the Restatement Effective Date.

                  SECTION 3.13. Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a
description of all insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the
Subsidiary Loan Parties as of the Restatement Effective Date. As of the
Restatement Effective Date, all premiums in respect of such insurance have been
paid. The Borrower believes that the insurance maintained by or on behalf of the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties is adequate.

                  SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Restatement Effective
Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any
Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The hours worked
by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have not
been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable
Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due
from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and
welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability
on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the
Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of
renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement
to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

                  SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of
the Restatement Transactions to occur on the Restatement Effective Date and
immediately following the making of each Loan made on the Restatement Effective
Date and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Loans,
(a) the fair value of the assets of the Loan Parties (taken as a whole), at a
fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities of the Loan Parties (taken
as a whole), subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair
saleable value of the property of the Loan Parties (taken as a whole) will be
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
the debts and other liabilities of the Loan Parties (taken as a whole),
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) the Loan Parties (taken as a whole) will be
able to pay the debts and liabilities of the Loan Parties (taken as a whole),
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured; and (d) the Loan Parties (taken as a whole) will not have
unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which the Loan
Parties are engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be
conducted following the Restatement Effective Date.

                  SECTION 3.16. Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations constitute
(a) "Designated Senior Debt" under and as defined in the 2008 Subordinated Notes
Indenture and (b) "Designated Exchange Debenture Senior Debt" under and as
defined in the Subordinated Exchange Debenture Indenture.

                  SECTION 3.17. Security Interests. The representations and
warranties in the Security Documents are true and correct in all material
respects.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   Conditions

                  SECTION 4.01. [Intentionally Omitted]

                  SECTION 4.02. Each Credit Event. The obligation of each Lender
to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, and of the Issuing Bank to
issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, is subject to receipt of the
request therefor in accordance herewith and to the satisfaction of the following
conditions:

                  (a) The representations and warranties of each Loan Party set
forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects
on and as of the date of such Borrowing or the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable.

                  (b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such
Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of
Credit, as applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate, dated as of the date of such Borrowing or the issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit and signed by the President, Vice
President or a Financial Officer of the Borrower, confirming that the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries are in compliance, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to such Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such
Letter of Credit, with the debt incurrence covenants contained in Section 4.9 of
the Subordinated Exchange Debenture Indenture and Section 9(a)(i) of the Series
A Preferred Certificate of Designation.

Each Borrowing (excluding any Borrowing consisting solely of a continuation or
conversion of an outstanding Borrowing) and each issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to constitute a representation
and warranty by the Borrower on the date thereof as to the matters specified in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section.

                                    ARTICLE V

                              Affirmative Covenants

                  Until the Commitments have expired or been terminated and the
principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have
been paid in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and
all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, the Borrower covenants and
agrees with the Lenders that:

                                       58

                  SECTION 5.01. Financial Statements and Other Information. The

operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows as of the end of and for such
year, setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the
previous fiscal year, all reported on by KPMG or other independent public
accountants of recognized national standing (without a "going concern" or like
qualification or exception and without any qualification or exception as to the
scope of such audit) to the effect that such consolidated financial statements
present fairly in all material respects the financial condition and results of
operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP consistently applied;

                  (b) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three
fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of the Borrower, its consolidated balance

as of the end of and for such fiscal quarter and the then elapsed portion of the

stating whether any change in GAAP or in the application thereof has occurred
since the date of the Borrower's audited financial statements referred to in
Section 3.04 and, if any such change has occurred, specifying the effect of such
change on the financial statements accompanying such certificate;

                  (d) within 45 days after the commencement of each fiscal year

promptly to notify the Administrative Agent if any material portion of the
Collateral is damaged or destroyed.

                  SECTION 5.05. Payment of Obligations. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay its Indebtedness and other
obligations, including Tax liabilities, before the same shall become delinquent
or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount thereof is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) the Borrower or such
Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in
accordance with GAAP, (c) such contest effectively suspends collection of the
contested obligation and the enforcement of any Lien securing such obligation
and (d) the failure to make payment pending such contest could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.06. Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will,
and will cause each of the Subsidiary Loan Parties to, keep and maintain all
property material to the conduct of its business in good working order and

risk retention) and against such risks as are customarily maintained by
companies of established repute engaged in the same or similar businesses
operating in the same or similar locations and (b) all insurance required to be
maintained pursuant to the Security Documents. The Borrower will furnish to the

casualty or other insured damage to any material portion of any Collateral or
the commencement of any action or proceeding for the taking of any material
portion of the Collateral or any part thereof or interest therein under power of
eminent domain or by condemnation or similar proceeding and (b) will ensure that
the Net Proceeds of any such event (whether in the form of insurance proceeds,

the applicable provisions of the Security Documents.

                  SECTION 5.09. Books and Records; Inspection Rights. The

reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested (it being hereby
understood and agreed that, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, any
such visit, inspection or examination shall be at the sole expense of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable).

                  SECTION 5.10. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations
and orders of any Governmental Authority (including the FCC) applicable to it or
its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 5.11. Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit. The
proceeds of the Loans (other than the Tranche C Term Loans and the Tranche D
Term Loans) will be used only for (a) the repayment of all amounts owing under

Permitted Acquisitions (other than the Acquisitions) and any fees or expenses
incurred by the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties in connection with such
Permitted Acquisitions and (e) to the extent of the excess, general corporate

excess, for general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Tranche D Term Loans
will be used only to prepay Tranche C Term Loans outstanding on the Restatement
Effective Date. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether
directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the
Regulations of the Board, including

                                       62

<PAGE>

Regulations T, U and X. Letters of Credit will be issued only to support
obligations of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties in the ordinary
course of business.

                  SECTION 5.12. Additional Subsidiaries. If any additional
Subsidiary is formed or acquired after the Restatement Effective Date, the
Borrower will, within 30 days after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired,
notify the Administrative Agent thereof and cause the Collateral and Guarantee
Requirement to be satisfied with respect to such Subsidiary (if it is a
Subsidiary Loan Party) and with respect to any Equity Interest in or
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary owned by or on behalf of any Loan Party.

                  SECTION 5.13. Further Assurances. (a) The Borrower will, and
will cause each Subsidiary Loan Party to, execute any and all further documents,
financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further
actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture
filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents), which may be required
under any applicable law, or which the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders may reasonably request, to cause the Collateral and Guarantee
Requirement to be and remain satisfied, all at the expense of the Loan Parties.
The Borrower also agrees to provide to the Administrative Agent, from time to
time upon request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
as to the perfection and priority of the Liens created or intended to be created
by the Security Documents.

                  (b) If any material assets (including any real property or
improvements thereto or any interest therein) are acquired by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary Loan Party after the Restatement Effective Date (other than
assets constituting Collateral under the Collateral Agreement that become
subject to the Lien of the Collateral Agreement upon acquisition thereof), the
Borrower will notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof, and, if
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, in
the case of any real property or improvements thereto or any interest therein,
if agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower), the Borrower will
cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the Obligations and will
take, and cause the Subsidiary Loan Parties to take, such actions as shall be
necessary or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to grant and
perfect such Liens, including actions described in paragraph (a) of this
Section, all at the expense of the Loan Parties.

incur, assume or permit to exist any Indebtedness, except:

                           (i) Indebtedness created under the Loan Documents
                  (including Indebtedness under any Incremental Facilities

                  purchased in the Debt Tender Offer) and extensions, renewals,
                  replacements or refinancings of any such Indebtedness that do
                  not increase the outstanding principal amount thereof or
                  result in an earlier maturity date or decreased weighted

                  or refinancing of any 2008 Subordinated Notes that remain
                  outstanding after April 30, 2003, shall be subordinate to the

                  Loan Party and of any Subsidiary Loan Party to the Borrower or

                  Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary; provided
                  that Guarantees by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party
                  of Indebtedness of any Excluded Subsidiary shall be subject to

                  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the
Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing
by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c)
except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent
or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire

                                       78

into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with
any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance
or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions
set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness
or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or
document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or
elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor to
the Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the
Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right,
in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor; provided that no such
consultation with the Borrower shall be required if a Default has occurred and
is continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint
a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New
York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan
Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent,

                                       79

its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as
Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

                  SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right
or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by
any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b) Except as provided in Section 2.19 with respect to an
Incremental Facility Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan
Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified
except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of
any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that
are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender
without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce
any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of
payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.09, or any
scheduled reduction in the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving
Commitments under Section 2.07, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC
Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a
manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,
without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of
this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders"
or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage
of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any
rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the
case may be),

                                       81

<PAGE>

(vi) release any Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Collateral
Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Collateral Agreement), or limit
its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each
Lender, (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens
of the Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii)
change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms
adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans
of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without
the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding
Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class (in addition to any consent
required under any other clause of this Section) or (ix) change the rights of
the Tranche B Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in Section
2.10, without the written consent of Tranche B Lenders holding a majority of the
outstanding Tranche B Term Loans; provided further that (A) no such agreement
shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank without the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and (B) any
waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects
the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders (but not the
Incremental Revolving Lenders, the Tranche A Lenders, the Tranche B Lenders and
the Incremental Term Lenders), the Incremental Revolving Lenders (but not the
Revolving Lenders, the Tranche A Lenders, the Tranche B Lenders and the
Incremental Term Lenders), the Tranche A Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders,
the Incremental Revolving Lenders, the Tranche B Lenders and the Incremental
Term Lenders), the Tranche B Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders, the
Incremental Revolving Lenders, the Tranche A Lenders and the Incremental Term
Lenders) or the Incremental Term Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders, the
Incremental Revolving Lenders, the Tranche A Lenders and the Tranche B Lenders)
may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders
that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such Class of
Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in
writing entered into by the Borrower, the Required Lenders and the
Administrative Agent (and, if its rights or obligations are affected thereby,
the Issuing Bank) if (i) by the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each
Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon
the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes
effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the
principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts
owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or
waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for
payment

                                       82

<PAGE>

thereunder and (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of
its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under
this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including all such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during
any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters
of Credit.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any
Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property currently or formerly
owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's pro
rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense
or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such. For purposes
hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of
the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused
Commitments at the time.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual

                                       83

<PAGE>

damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan
or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
(i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder (other than as expressly provided in clause (ii) of
Section 6.03(a)) without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assignees
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph
(b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                  (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower
         shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
         Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default
         under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is
         continuing, any other assignee;

                  (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the
         Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of (1) any
         Revolving Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Revolving
         Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment or (2)
         a Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;
         and

                  (C) in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a
         Revolving Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC
         Exposure, the Issuing Bank.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
         conditions:

                                       84

<PAGE>

                  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
         Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the
         entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans
         of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning
         Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
         Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered
         to the Administrative Agent), unless each of the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent otherwise consents, shall not be less than
         $5,000,000 (or $1,000,000 in the case of the Tranche D Term Loans);
         provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an
         Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has
         occurred and is continuing;

                  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
         a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause shall not
         be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all
         the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class
         of Commitments or Loans;

                  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
         a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (with only one such fee
         payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to or by two or
         more Approved Funds); and

                  (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

                  For purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved Fund"
has the following meaning:

                  "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person)
         that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank
         loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
         business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an
         Affiliate of that Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity
         that administers or manages a Lender.

            (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this Section 9.04.

                                       85

<PAGE>

            (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in this Section
9.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by this Section
9.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of or notice to
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations
to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan
Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first
proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph
(c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as
if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as
though it were a Lender.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to

                                       86

<PAGE>

such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A
Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a
Lender.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank
loans, such Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights (but not
obligations) under this Agreement, including the Loans and any notes or any
other instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any
holder of, trustee for, or any other representative of holders of, obligations
owed or securities issued by such fund, as security for such obligations or
securities; provided that any foreclosure or similar action by such trustee or
representative shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.04
concerning assignments.

                  SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit
is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall
survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration
or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written,

                                       87

<PAGE>

relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective as
provided in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account
of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service
of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of New York.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to
bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

                  (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the

                                       88

<PAGE>

fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood
that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority or rating
agency, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any
subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e)
in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of
the Borrower, (h) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in any
swap, hedge or similar agreement or such contractual counterparty's professional
advisor to such contractual counterparty, so long as such contractual
counterparty or such professional advisor agrees to be bound by the provisions
of this Section, or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach

                                       89

<PAGE>
of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than
the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all
information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by
the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the
Borrower after the Effective Date, such information is clearly identified at the
time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

                  SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as
interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the "Charges"), shall
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                  SECTION 9.14. Existing Credit Agreement; Effectiveness of
Amendment and Restatement. Until this Agreement becomes effective in accordance
with the terms of the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the Existing Credit
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected
hereby. After the Restatement Effective Date, all obligations of the Borrower
under the Existing Credit Agreement shall become obligations of the Borrower
hereunder, secured by the Security Documents, and the provisions of the Existing
Credit Agreement shall be superseded by the provisions hereof.

                        AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT AGREEMENT dated as of January
                  29, 2004, among CUMULUS MEDIA INC., a Delaware corporation
                  (the "Borrower"), the Lenders party hereto and JPMORGAN CHASE
                  BANK, as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement dated
                  as of March 28, 2002, as amended and restated as of April 28,
                  2003 (as amended, supplemented and modified and in effect on
                  the date hereof, the "Existing Credit Agreement"), among the
                  Borrower, the lenders referred to therein and the
                  Administrative Agent.

            WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested, and the Required Restatement
Lenders and the Administrative Agent have agreed, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, that (a) the Renewing Tranche C Lenders and the

provided herein;

            NOW, THEREFORE, the Borrower, the Required Restatement Lenders and
the Administrative Agent hereby agree as follows:

            SECTION 1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Restated Credit
Agreement referred to below, except that the term "Tranche C Lender" has the
meaning assigned to such term in the Existing Credit Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, "Required Restatement Lenders" means, at any time, (a) Lenders under
the Existing Credit Agreement having Revolving Exposures, Tranche A Term Loans,
Tranche C Term Loans and unused Revolving Commitments representing more than 50%
of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Tranche A Term Loans,
outstanding Tranche C Term Loans and unused Revolving Commitments at such time,
(b) Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement having Tranche A Term Loans
representing more than 50% of the sum of the outstanding Tranche A Term Loans at
such time (the lenders referred to in clauses (a) and (b), the "Consenting
Lenders"), (c) the Renewing Tranche C Lenders referred to below and (iv) the
Additional Tranche D Lenders referred to below.

            SECTION 2. Restatement Effective Date. (a) The transactions provided
for in Sections 3 through 5 hereof shall be consummated at a closing to be held
on the Restatement Effective Date at the offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP,

            SECTION 3. Tranche D Term Loans; Prepayment of Tranche C Term Loans.
(a) Each existing Tranche C Lender (in each case, an "Existing Tranche C
Lender") that executes and delivers this Agreement specifically in the capacity
of a renewing Lender (a "Renewing Tranche C Lender") will be deemed upon the
Restatement Effective Date to have agreed to the terms of this Agreement and to
have made a commitment to make Tranche D Term Loans in an aggregate principal
amount up to, but not in excess of, the aggregate principal amount of such
Renewing Tranche C Lender's Tranche C Term Loans outstanding immediately prior
to the Restatement Effective Date (collectively, such Lender's "Existing Tranche
C Term Loans"). Each Person (other than a Renewing Tranche C Lender in its
capacity as such) that agrees to make Tranche D Term Loans (an "Additional
Tranche D Lender" and, together with the Renewing Tranche C Lenders, the
"Tranche D Lenders") will, on the Restatement Effective Date, make such Tranche
D Term Loans to the Borrower in the manner contemplated by paragraph (c) of this
Section.

            (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each
Tranche D Lender agrees to make a Tranche D Term Loan to the Borrower on the
Restatement Effective Date in a principal amount equal to its Tranche D
Commitment. For purposes hereof, a Person shall become an Additional Tranche D
Lender and a party to the Restated Credit Agreement by executing and delivering
to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the Restatement Effective Date, a
signature page to this Agreement. The "Tranche D Commitment" (x) of any Renewing
Tranche C Lender will be such amount (not in excess of the amount of its
Existing Tranche C Term Loans) as is determined by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
and set forth on Schedule 1 hereto and (y) of any Additional Tranche D Lender
will be the amount of such commitment set forth on Schedule 1 hereto. The
commitments of the Renewing Tranche C Lenders and the Additional Tranche D
Lenders are several and no such Lender will be responsible for any other
Lender's failure to make Tranche D Term Loans.

            (c) Each Renewing Tranche C Lender and each Additional Tranche D
Lender will make Tranche D Term Loans on the Restatement Effective Date by (i)
exchanging its Existing Tranche C Term Loans, if any, for Tranche D Term Loans
in an equal principal amount (to the extent the amounts of such Existing Tranche
C Term Loans, if any, do not exceed the Tranche D Commitment of such Lender) and
(ii) transferring to the Administrative Agent, in the manner contemplated by
Section 2.05 of the Restated Credit Agreement, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of its Tranche D Commitment over the principal amount of its Existing
Tranche C Term Loans exchanged pursuant to clause (i) above.

            (d) The Tranche D Term Loans shall be made on the Restatement
Effective Date as Eurodollar Borrowings. The provisions of Sections 2.02 and
2.05 of the Restated Credit Agreement shall apply for all purposes of making the
Tranche D Term Loans, except as otherwise provided herein.

            (e) The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the
Administrative Agent to apply the proceeds of the Tranche D Term Loans received
by the Administrative Agent on the Restatement Effective Date to repay, pursuant
to

                                        2

<PAGE>

Section 2.10(a) of the Existing Credit Agreement, all Tranche C Term Loans
outstanding as of such date (other than those exchanged for Tranche D Term Loans
as provided above). On the Restatement Effective Date the Borrower shall pay
accrued and unpaid interest on the Tranche C Term Loans (including those
exchanged for Tranche D Term Loans as provided above), or any other amounts
(including amounts under Section 2.15 of the Existing Credit Agreement) owing in
respect of the, Tranche C Term Loans. The exchange of all or any portion of a
Tranche C Term Loan for a Tranche D Term Loan shall be treated as a repayment
thereof for purposes of Section 2.15 of the Existing Credit Agreement.

            (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Tranche D Lender prior to the Restatement Effective Date that such Tranche D
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Tranche D
Lender's share of such Tranche D Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Tranche D Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with this Section. If any Tranche D Lender shall default in the
payment of any amount due from it under this Section, then the applicable
Tranche D Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such defaulted amount (to the extent so advanced by
the Administrative Agent on behalf of such defaulting Tranche D Lender) to the
Administrative Agent, together with interest on such amount at the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans that are Tranche D Borrowings from the Restatement
Effective Date to the date of payment. Upon any such payment by the Borrower,
the Borrower shall have the right, at the defaulting Tranche D Lender's expense,
upon notice to the defaulting Tranche D Lender and to the Administrative Agent,
to require such defaulting Tranche D Lender to transfer and assign without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04 of the Restated Credit Agreement) all its interests, rights and
obligations as a Tranche D Lender under the Restated Credit Agreement to another
financial institution which shall assume such interests, rights and obligations,
provided that (i) no such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or
regulation or order of any Governmental Authority and (ii) the assignee shall
pay, in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment, to the
Borrower, the amount of the defaulted amount of the Tranche D Term Loans that
the Borrower paid to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

            SECTION 4. Amendment and Restatement of the Existing Credit
Agreement; Loans and Letters of Credit. (a) Effective immediately after the
prepayment of the Tranche C Term Loans under Section 3 above, the Existing
Credit Agreement (excluding the annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto that are
not attached as part of Exhibit A hereto, which shall remain as in effect prior
to the Restatement Effective Date) is hereby amended and restated to read in its
entirety as set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the "Restated Credit Agreement"), and
the Administrative Agent is hereby directed by the Required Restatement Lenders
to enter into such Loan Documents and to take such other actions as may be
required to give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6, execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be deemed execution and delivery of the
Restated Credit Agreement in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto. From and
after the effectiveness of such amendment and restatement, the terms
"Agreement", "this

                                        3

<PAGE>

Agreement", "herein", "hereinafter", "hereto", "hereof" and words of similar
import, as used in the Restated Credit Agreement, shall, unless the context
otherwise requires, refer to the Existing Credit Agreement as amended and
restated in the form of the Restated Credit Agreement, and the term "Credit
Agreement", as used in the other Loan Documents, shall mean the Restated Credit
Agreement.

            (b) All Tranche A Term Loans, Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Restatement Effective
Date shall continue to be outstanding under the Restated Credit Agreement and
the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement will govern the rights of the Lenders
and the Issuing Bank with respect thereto.

            SECTION 5. Waiver. The Tranche A Lenders party hereto, on behalf of
all Tranche A Lenders, hereby waive the provisions under the Existing Credit
Agreement with respect to the pro rata allocation of voluntary prepayments of
Term Borrowings thereunder and consent to the application of the proceeds of the
Tranche D Term Loans and exchange of Tranche C Term Loans for Tranche D Term
Loans as provided in Section 3. The Required Restatement Lenders hereby consent
to the waiver contained in this Section 5.

            SECTION 6. Conditions. The consummation of the transactions set
forth in Sections 3 through 5 of this Agreement shall be subject to the

      which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the Borrower,
      the Administrative Agent and the Required Restatement Lenders.

            (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received a favorable written

      Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 and (ii) Kolesar &
      Leatham, Chtd., Nevada local counsel for the Borrower, substantially in
      the form of Exhibit B-2 and, in the case of each such opinion required by

      certificates as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may reasonably

      to the extent invoiced, reimbursement or payment of all reasonable
      out-of-pocket expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of
      counsel) required to be reimbursed or paid by any Loan Party hereunder or
      under any other Loan Document.
