I confirm that I am accepting the Award(s) subject to the terms and conditions contained in the SIP, the Award Agreement(s), and this signature card (the &#147;Signature Card&#148;), including, but not limited to, the requirement that certain
disputes be decided through arbitration in New York City and be governed by New York law. For the avoidance of doubt, references to a &#147;share&#148; or &#147;Share&#148; herein mean a share of the common stock of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(&#147;GS Inc.&#148;) and, where applicable, deliveries of cash or other property in lieu thereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the avoidance of doubt, I understand and agree that
to be eligible to receive any award under the SIP or any predecessor plan, I must not have engaged in any conduct constituting &#147;Cause&#148; (as defined in the SIP) prior to the grant of the award, and by accepting this Award, I represent and
warrant that I have not engaged in any conduct constituting Cause. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a condition of this grant, I understand that the Award(s) (as well as any other
award that the Firm may grant to me under the SIP) is/are subject to governing law provisions as outlined in this Signature Card or in the applicable Award Agreement(s), and, as a condition to receiving such awards, I agree to be bound thereby. As a

and I understand that failure to supply a required form may result in the imposition of backup withholding on certain payments I receive pursuant to this grant. </P>

authorize GS Inc., or its designee, to sell, assign or transfer such shares to GS Inc. or such other persons as it may determine in the event of a forfeiture of such shares pursuant to any agreement with GS Inc. </P>

award under the SIP, as determined by the Firm, when requested and as directed by the Firm, I will agree to a Joint Election under s431 ITEPA 2003 of the laws of the United Kingdom for full or partial disapplication of Chapter 2 Income Tax (Earnings
and Pension) Act 2003 under the laws of the United Kingdom and will sign and return such election in respect of all future deliveries of Shares underlying the Award(s) and any previous grants made to me under the SIP and understand that the Firm
intends to meet its delivery obligations in Shares with respect to my Award(s), except as may be prohibited by law or described in the accompanying Award Agreement(s) or supplementary materials. </P>

the Firm, and (ii)&nbsp;I hereby agree to be bound by any rulings agreed by the Firm in respect of any Award(s), which is expected to result in taxation at the time of delivery of Shares, and (iii)&nbsp;I undertake to declare and make a full and
accurate income tax declaration in respect of my Award(s) in accordance with the above ruling or as directed by the Firm. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. I have read and understand
the Firm&#146;s &#147;Notice Periods for Recipients of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Year-End</FONT> Equity-Based Awards&#148; policy (the &#147;Notice Policy&#148;) available through the HR
Workways<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> link on GSWeb or as otherwise provided to me, pursuant to which I am required to provide certain specified advance notice of my intent to leave employment with the Firm. I understand

conditions of my employment. I agree to this change in consideration of my continued employment with the Firm and the Firm&#146;s offer of the Award(s). I understand that the Notice Policy requires me, among other things, to provide my employing

the Notice Policy, I will have failed to meet an obligation I have under an agreement with the Firm, as a result of which the Firm may have certain legal and equitable rights and remedies, including, without limitation, forfeiture of the Award(s)
and any other awards granted to me under the SIP. The Firm may forfeit such Award(s) for violation of the Notice Policy irrespective of whether this agreement constitutes a legally recognized permanent change to my terms and conditions of
employment, and irrespective of whether applicable law permits me to make a payment in lieu of notice. In addition, the Firm may seek an order or injunction from a court or arbitration panel to stop a breach and may also seek other permissible
remedies. The Firm may hold me personally liable for any damages it suffers as a result of the breach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This agreement concerning my notice period is being

account (an &#147;Account&#148;), as required or approved by the Firm in its sole discretion. I agree to access, review, execute and be bound by any agreements that govern any such Account, including any provisions that provide for the applicable
restrictions on transfers, pledges and withdrawals of Shares, permitting the Firm to monitor any such Account, and the limitations on the liability of the party (which may not be affiliated with the Firm) providing the Account and the Firm. I
understand and agree that the Firm may direct the transfer of securities, cash or other assets in my Account to the Firm in connection with any indebtedness or any other obligation that I have to the Firm, as determined by the Firm in its sole
discretion, however such obligation may have arisen. I also agree to open an Account with any other custodian, broker, trustee, transfer agent or similar party selected by the Firm, if the Firm, in its sole discretion, requires me to open an account
with such custodian, broker, trustee, transfer agent or similar party as a condition to delivery of Shares underlying the Award(s). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. If the Firm
advanced or loaned me funds to pay certain taxes (including income taxes and Social Security, or similar contributions) in connection with the Award(s) (or does so in the future), and if I have not signed a separate loan agreement governing
repayment, I authorize the Firm to withhold from my compensation any amounts required to reimburse it for any such advance or loan to the extent permitted by applicable law. </P>

taxpayers under certain circumstances), any outstanding amounts that I then owe the Firm against its delivery obligations under the Award(s), against any obligations to remove restrictions and/or other terms and conditions in respect of any
Restricted Shares or Shares at Risk (each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement) or against any other amounts the Firm then owes me, including payments of dividends or dividend equivalent payments. I understand that the delivery of Shares
pursuant to the Award(s) is conditioned on my satisfaction of any applicable taxes or Social Security contributions (collectively referred to as &#147;tax&#148; or &#147;taxes&#148; for purposes of the SIP and all related documents) in accordance
with the SIP. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Firm, in its sole discretion, may require me to provide amounts equal to all or a portion of any Federal, State, local, foreign or other tax obligations imposed on me or the
