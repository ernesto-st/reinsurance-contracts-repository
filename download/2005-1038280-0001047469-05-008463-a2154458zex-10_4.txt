the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrowers that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof
for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE CREDITS

          SECTION 2.01. COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender agrees (a) to make a Term Loan to the Borrowers on the
Effective Date in a principal amount not exceeding its Term Loan Commitment and
(b) to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the
Revolving Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not
result in such Lender's Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving
Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.
Amounts repaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

          SECTION 2.02. LOANS AND BORROWINGS. (a) Each Loan (other than a
Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the
same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to
make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder; PROVIDED that the Commitments of the Lenders are
several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to
make Loans as required.

          (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing and Term Loan
Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the
Borrowers may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan shall be an
ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any
domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
PROVIDED that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $4,000,000. At the time that each ABR
Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that
is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000. Each Swingline
Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $250,000 and not less
than $250,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at
the same time; PROVIDED that there shall not at any time be more than a total of
10 Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Loan may be in an aggregate
amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Revolving
Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e).

  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrowers shall
not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if
the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving
Maturity Date or Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable.

          SECTION 2.03. REQUESTS FOR BORROWINGS. To request a Revolving
Borrowing or Term Loan Borrowing, the Borrowers shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the
date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of the
proposed Borrowing; PROVIDED that any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing
to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section
2.05(e) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date
of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be
irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the
Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrowers. Each such telephonic and
written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance
with Section 2.02:

          (i) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Revolving Borrowing
     or Term Loan Borrowing;

          (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

          (iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iv) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
     Borrowing;

          (v) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest
     Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by
     the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

          (vi) the location and number of the Borrowers' account to which funds
     are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of
     Section 2.06.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then the Borrowers
shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.04. SWINGLINE LOANS. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the
Borrowers from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding
$5,000,000 or (ii) the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the total Revolving
Commitments; PROVIDED that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding

                                                                              27

Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow
Swingline Loans.

          (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrowers shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not
later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline
Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date
(which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The
Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such
notice received from the Borrowers. The Swingline Lender shall make each
Swingline Loan available to the Borrowers by means of a credit to the general
deposit account of the Borrowers maintained with the Swingline Lender (or, in
the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank)
by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

          (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any
Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such
Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice
shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders
will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent
will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice
such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans.
Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt
of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline
Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this
paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each
Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall
apply, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the
amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrowers of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired
pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline
Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender.
Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrowers (or other party
on behalf of the Borrowers) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the
Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The
purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan

                                                                              28

pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrowers of any default in the
payment thereof.

          SECTION 2.05. LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may request the issuance of Letters
of Credit for the account of any one of them, in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Revolving Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions
of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Borrowers to, or entered into by the Borrowers with, the Issuing Bank relating
to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
control.

          (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, EXTENSION; CERTAIN
CONDITIONS. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrowers shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date
of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended,
renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the
amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or
extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers
also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard
form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $2,000,000
and (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving
Commitments.

          (c) EXPIRATION DATE. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

          (d) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and

<Page>

                                                                              29

unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the date due as
provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment
required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason. Each Revolving Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever.

          (e) REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such
LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrowers shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrowers prior to such time on such date,
then not later than (i) 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day that
the Borrowers receive such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) 12:00 noon,
New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the
Borrowers receive such notice, if such notice is not received prior to 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt; PROVIDED that, if such LC
Disbursement is not less than $250,000, the Borrowers may, subject to the
conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrowers' obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the
Borrowers fail to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then
due from the Borrowers in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable
Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the
payment then due from the Borrowers, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall
apply, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrowers pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the
Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving
Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC
Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan
as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the
Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                                                                              30

          (f) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrowers' obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers' obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are
hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law)
suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to
exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented
under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto
expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on
the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each
such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the
generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept
and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or
refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not
in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation
to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such
LC Disbursement.

                                                                              31

          (h) INTERIM INTEREST. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers reimburse such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
PROVIDED that, if the Borrowers fail to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the
Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

          (i) REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING BANK. The Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent,
the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At
the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay
all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

          (j) CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrowers receive notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrowers shall deposit in an account with the
Collateral Agent, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon; PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit
such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrowers
described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Each such deposit shall be held
by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall
have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment
of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers' risk and expense,
such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied

                                                                              32

by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements
for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be
held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for
the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure
representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy
other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If the Borrowers are
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

          SECTION 2.06. FUNDING OF BORROWINGS. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders; PROVIDED that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided
in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrowers by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of one or more of the Borrowers maintained with the Administrative Agent
in New York City and designated by the Borrowers in the applicable Borrowing
Request; PROVIDED that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07. INTEREST ELECTIONS. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and
Term Loan Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03 and, in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing
Request or designated by Section 2.03. Thereafter, the Borrowers may elect to
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in
the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as
provided in this Section. The Borrowers may

<Page>

                                                                              33

elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the
Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising
each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall
not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrowers shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrowers were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrowers.

          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
     and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
     portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
     Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
     clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
     Borrowing);

          (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
     Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
     Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
     election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e) If the Borrowers fail to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so

<Page>

                                                                              34

notifies the Borrowers, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i)
no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar
Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted
to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.08. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. (a) Unless
previously terminated, (i) the Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the Effective Date and (ii) the Revolving
Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.

          (b) The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Revolving Commitments; PROVIDED that (i) each reduction of the
Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers shall not
terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any
concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11,
the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

          (c) The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of
this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrowers pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; PROVIDED that a notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrowers may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments
shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Revolving Commitments.

          SECTION 2.09. REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) The Borrowers
hereby unconditionally promise to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term
Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline
Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of
the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made
that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business
Days after such Swingline Loan is made; PROVIDED that on each date that a
Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrowers shall repay all Swingline Loans that
were outstanding on the date such Borrowing was requested.

          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such
Lender

<Page>

                                                                              35

resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; PROVIDED that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.10. AMORTIZATION OF TERM LOANS. (a) Subject to adjustment
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, the Borrowers shall repay Term Loan
Borrowings on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount set
forth opposite such date:

          (b) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans shall be due and
payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

          (c) Any prepayment of a Term Loan shall be applied (i) in the case of
a prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(a), to reduce the subsequent
scheduled payments of the Term Loans to be made pursuant to this Section, at the
option of the applicable Borrower, ratably or in the inverse order of maturity
and (ii) in the case of a prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or
2.11(d), to reduce the subsequent scheduled payments of the Term Loans to be
made pursuant to this Section in the inverse order of maturity.

          SECTION 2.11. PREPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) The Borrowers shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

          (b) In the event and on such occasion that the Revolving Exposures
exceed the total Revolving Commitments, the Borrowers shall prepay Revolving
Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding,
deposit cash collateral in an account with the Collateral Agent pursuant to
Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

          (c) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are
received by or on behalf of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of
any Prepayment Event, the Borrowers shall, within five Business Days after such
Net Proceeds are received, prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an aggregate amount
equal to (i) in the case of a Prepayment Event described in clause (c) of the
definition of the term "Prepayment Event", 50% of such Net Proceeds, (ii) in the
case of a Prepayment Event described in clause (d) of the term "Prepayment
Event", 100% of such Net Proceeds in excess of $2,000,000 and (iii) in the case
of all other Prepayment Events, 100% of such Net Proceeds; PROVIDED that, in the
case of any event described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition of the term
"Prepayment Event", if the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a
certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that the Parent Borrower and
the Subsidiaries intend to apply the Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion
thereof specified in such certificate), within 180 days after receipt of such
Net Proceeds, to acquire real property, equipment or other tangible assets to be
used in the business of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and certifying
that no Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be
required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in respect of
such event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such certificate,
if applicable) except to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have
not been so applied by the end of such 180-day period,

<Page>

                                                                              37

at which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to such Net
Proceeds that have not been so applied.

          (d) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Parent Borrower,
commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005, the Borrowers shall
prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to (i) for any fiscal
year for which the Funded Debt Ratio at the end of such fiscal year is greater
than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year and
(ii) for any fiscal year for which the Funded Debt Ratio at the end of such
fiscal year is less than 1.50 to 1.00, 0% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal
year. Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the
date on which financial statements are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with
respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and
in any event within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

          (e) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings
hereunder, the Borrowers shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (f) of this Section.

          (f) The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; PROVIDED that, if a
notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08,
then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is
revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be
permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided
in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a
mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to
the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

          SECTION 2.12. FEES. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which
shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the
Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate. Accrued

<Page>

                                                                              38

commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a
Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the
outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline
Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).

          (b) The Borrowers agree to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's
Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have
any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on
which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard
fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter
of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting
fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
PROVIDED that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within
10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed
on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (c) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.

          (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.13. INTEREST. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
(including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate.

          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable Rate.

          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrowers hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding
paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% plus
the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section.

          (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Revolving Commitments; PROVIDED that (i) interest accrued
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of
an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on
the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

          (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
     exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
     the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and
     fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their
     Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

<Page>

                                                                              40

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.15. INCREASED COSTS. (a) Except with respect to Taxes which
shall be governed solely and exclusively by Section 2.17, if any Change in Law
shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

          (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank
     market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans
     made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
subject to Section 2.19, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank reasonably determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will,
subject to Section 2.19, pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the
Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such
reduction suffered.

          (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section and

<Page>

                                                                              41

setting forth the basis for such amounts and a calculation thereof in reasonable
detail shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business
Days after receipt thereof.

          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED
that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing
Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.16. BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under Section 2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d)
the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of
a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.17. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes or

<Page>

                                                                              42

Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative
Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Borrowers shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

          (b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation and basis for
such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or the Issuing
Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender
or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, the Borrowers shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrowers are located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

          (f) Each Lender, the Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent that is a
United States Person, as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (other than
Persons that are corporations or otherwise exempt from United States backup
withholding Tax), shall deliver at the time(s) and in the manner(s) prescribed
by applicable law, to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (as
applicable), a properly completed and duly executed United States Internal
Revenue Form W-9 or any successor form, certifying that

<Page>

                                                                              43

such Person is exempt from United States backup withholding Tax on payments made
hereunder.

          (g) If the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or a Lender
determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with
respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrowers (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrowers
under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid
by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); PROVIDED,
that the Borrowers, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or such Lender, agree to repay the amount paid over to the Borrowers (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender in the
event the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender is required to
repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be
construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available
its tax returns (or any information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrowers or any other person.

          SECTION 2.18. PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF
SET-OFFS. (a) The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or
under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to
the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any
such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under
any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case
of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in
dollars.

          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties

<Page>

                                                                              44

entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to
such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then
due to such parties.

          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; PROVIDED that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Parent
Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
this paragraph shall apply). The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agree,
to the extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against the Borrowers' rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers
in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event,
if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

                                                                              45

          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(a) or (b), 2.18(d) or
9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

          SECTION 2.19. MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers
hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); PROVIDED that (i) the Borrowers
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline
Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender
shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to
apply.

                                                                              46

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          The Borrowers represent and warrant to the Lenders that:

          SECTION 3.01. ORGANIZATION; POWERS. Each of the Parent Borrower and
the Subsidiaries are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, have all requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to

a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and are in good
standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required for the
conduct of its business.

          SECTION 3.02. AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other action and, if required, stockholder action. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Borrowers and constitutes,
and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when
executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Borrowers or such Loan Party (as the case may be),
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

          SECTION 3.03. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS. The Transactions
(a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or
any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect and except filings necessary
to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents, (b) will not violate any
Requirement of Law applicable to the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, (c) will
not violate or result in a default under any material indenture, material
agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Parent Borrower or any
Subsidiary or their assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary or give rise to a
right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any
obligation thereunder, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any asset of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, except Liens
created under the Loan Documents.

          SECTION 3.04. FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. (a) The
Parent Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows

June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 (and for the comparable periods for the
prior fiscal year), certified by its chief financial officer. Such financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and
results of operations and cash flows of the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries
as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in
the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above. The Parent Borrower
has heretofore furnished to the Lenders unaudited statements of income for the
Acquired Business for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004 and the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. Such financial statements (i) except as
specifically noted therein, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
consistently with the Company's past practices and (ii) are complete and correct
in all material respects, except as specifically noted therein, and present
fairly in all material respects the results of operations of the Acquired
Business as of such dates and for such periods covered thereby.

          (b) The Parent Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2004, prepared giving
effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on such date.
Such pro forma consolidated balance sheet (i) has been prepared in good faith
based on the same assumptions used to prepare the pro forma financial statements
included in the Information Memorandum (which assumptions are believed by the
Parent Borrower to be reasonable), (ii) is based on the best information
available to the Parent Borrower after due inquiry, (iii) accurately reflects
all material adjustments necessary to give effect to the Transactions and (iv)
presents fairly, in all material respects, the pro forma financial position of
the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004, as if the
Transactions had occurred on such date.

          (c) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above
or the notes thereto or in the Information Memorandum and except for the
Disclosed Matters, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Parent
Borrower or the Subsidiaries has, as of the Effective Date, any material direct
or contingent liabilities, unusual long-term commitments or unrealized losses.

          (d) No event, change or condition has occurred that has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the business,
operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise), liabilities
or prospects of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries (after giving effect to
the Acquisition), taken as a whole, whether or not covered by insurance, since
December 31, 2003.

          SECTION 3.05. PROPERTIES. (a) Each of the Parent Borrower and the
Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real
and personal property material to its business (including the Mortgaged
Properties), except for (i) minor defects in title that do not interfere with
its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or as proposed to be
conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes and (ii)
leaseholds subject to all superior title matters and all matters which encumber
the landlord's or ground lessor's interest.

                                                                              48

          (b) Each of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any
other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (c) Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property that is
owned or leased by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than addresses
of the locations to which the Laundry Facility Agreements relate) as of the
Effective Date after giving effect to the Transactions.

          SECTION 3.06. LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Parent Borrower,
threatened against the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to
which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

          (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Parent Borrower nor
any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain,
maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii)
has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or
(iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

          (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the
status of the Schedule 3.06 of Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.07. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND AGREEMENTS. Each of the Parent
Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other
instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.08. INVESTMENT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS. Neither the
Parent Borrower nor any Subsidiary is (a) an "investment company" as defined in,
or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

          SECTION 3.09. TAXES. Each of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries
has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to
have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have
been paid by it, except (a) any Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Parent Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $250,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present
value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements
reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $250,000 the fair market value of
the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

          SECTION 3.11. DISCLOSURE. The Borrowers have disclosed to the Lenders
all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which the
Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject, and all other matters known to any
of them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any
of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information
furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented by
other information so furnished) contains, when taken as a whole, any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; PROVIDED that, with respect to projected financial
information, the Parent Borrower represents only that such information was
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the
time delivered and, if such projected financial information was delivered prior
to the Effective Date, as of the Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.12. SUBSIDIARIES. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of, and
the ownership interest of the Parent Borrower in, each Subsidiary of the Parent
Borrower and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each
case as of the Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.13. INSURANCE. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a description of all
insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, all premiums in respect of
such insurance have been paid. The Borrowers believe that the insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries is
adequate.

                                                                              50

          SECTION 3.14. LABOR MATTERS. As of the Effective Date, there are no
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary
pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent Borrower, threatened. The hours
worked by and payments made to employees of the Parent Borrower and the
Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters.
All payments of a material amount due from the Parent Borrower or any
Subsidiary, or for which any reasonably foreseeable claim may be made against
the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health
and welfare insurance and other benefits (other than routine claims for
benefits), have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Parent
Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give
rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any
union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Parent Borrower or
any Subsidiary is bound.

          SECTION 3.15. SOLVENCY. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Effective Date, (a) the fair value of the assets of
the Loan Parties, taken as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their debts
and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, (b) the present fair
saleable value of the property of the Loan Parties, taken as a whole, will be
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
their debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) the Loan
Parties will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured and (d) the Loan Parties will not have unreasonably small capital with
which to conduct the business in which they are engaged as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Effective Date.

          (b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such
Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of
Credit, as applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

Each Borrowing and each issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the
Borrowers on the date thereof as to the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section.

                                    ARTICLE V

PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger, consolidation,
liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.03.

          SECTION 5.05. PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. The Parent Borrower will, and
will cause each Subsidiary to, pay its Material Indebtedness and other material
obligations, including Tax liabilities, before the same shall become delinquent
or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount thereof is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) the Parent Borrower or

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

          Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. For purposes of this
Article VIII, all references to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be
references to both the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.

          The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business

<Page>

                                                                              72

with the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it
were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that
is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrowers or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in
connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan
Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such

<Page>

                                                                              73

sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such
subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time upon notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the
Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right,
in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor. If no successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of
any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

          (d) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number)
     set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

          SECTION 9.02. WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the

                                                                              75

Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.

          (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; PROVIDED
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of payment of the
principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.10, or the required date of
reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any
interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section
2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of
the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of
"Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive,
amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any
consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender
of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release any Subsidiary Loan Party from
its Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except as expressly provided in
the Collateral Agreement), or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee,
without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) release all or substantially
all the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents, without the written
consent of each Lender or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a
manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due
to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of
any other Class, without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in
interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class;
PROVIDED FURTHER that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) any
waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects
the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders (but not the
Term Loan Lenders) or the Term Loan Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders) may
be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Borrowers and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders
that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such Class of
Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time.

          SECTION 9.03. EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER. (a) The Borrowers
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or
waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for
payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents,
including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans or Letters of Credit.

          (b) The Borrowers (and, in the case of the Collateral Agreement, the
Grantors and Guarantors) shall jointly and severally indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, each Lender and
each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being
called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the
fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by
or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Parent Borrower
or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of
(i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby (other than, in the case of the Lenders, costs
associated with the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents), the
performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property currently or formerly
owned or operated by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any Environmental
Liability related in any way to the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, or (iv)
any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing or to the Collateral, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the
Parent Borrower or any other Loan Party and regardless of whether any Indemnitee
is a party thereto; PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence,
wilful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnitee.

                                                                              77

          (c) To the extent that the Borrowers (and, in the case of the
Collateral Agreement, the Grantors and Guarantors) fail to pay any amount
required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the
Collateral Agent or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be,
such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the
Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro
rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total
Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at the time.

          (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers (and, in
the case of the Collateral Agreement, the Grantors and Guarantors) shall not
assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

          (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than
three Business Days after written demand therefor.

          SECTION 9.04. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i)
the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrowers without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of (A) the Borrowers;
PROVIDED that no consent of the Borrowers shall be required for an assignment to
a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved

<Page>

                                                                              78

Fund (as defined below) or, if a Default has occurred and is continuing, any
other assignee, (B) the Administrative Agent; PROVIDED that no consent of the
Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of all or any portion
of a Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund and (C)
the Issuing Bank, PROVIDED that no consent of the Issuing Bank shall be required
for an assignment of all or any portion of a Term Loan.

          (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of
a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans
of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered
to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 or, in the case
of a Term Loan, $1,000,000, unless each of Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent otherwise consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), PROVIDED that no such consent of the Borrowers shall be required if a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (B) each partial assignment shall be
made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, PROVIDED that this clause (B) shall
not be construed to prohibit assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments
or Loans; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500 and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender,
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

          For purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" and
"CLO" have the following meanings:

          "APPROVED FUND" means (a) a CLO and (b) with respect to any Lender
that is a fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any
other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is
managed by the same investment advisor as such Lender or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor.

          "CLO" means an entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing
in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and is administered or managed by a Lender or an Affiliate of such
Lender.

          (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(v) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this

<Page>

                                                                              79

Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does
not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (c)(i) of this Section.

          (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment
and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

          (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
PROVIDED that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the
Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17

<Page>

                                                                              80

to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

          (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Sections 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation
sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrowers, to comply with Sections 2.17(e) or (f) as though it were a Lender.

          (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

          SECTION 9.05. SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of
Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

          SECTION 9.06. COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other
Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable
to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof

<Page>

                                                                              81

and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section
4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by
the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.07. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.08. RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrowers against any of and all the obligations of the Borrowers now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 9.09. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF
PROCESS. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

          (a) Each of the Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to
bring any

                                                                              82

action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against the Borrowers or their properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

          (b) Each of the Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

          (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

          SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

          SECTION 9.11. HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.12. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including

Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or

(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other the Borrowers.
For the purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means all information received
from the Borrowers relating to the Borrowers or their business, other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided
in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do
so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

          SECTION 9.13. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

          SECTION 9.14. USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Lender hereby notifies the
Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "ACT"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the
Act.

          SECTION 9.15. OBLIGATIONS JOINT AND SEVERAL. Each Borrower agrees that
it shall, jointly with each other Borrower and severally, be liable for all the
Obligations. Each Borrower further agrees that the Obligations of any other
Borrower may be extended and renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or
further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its agreement
hereunder notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation of any
other Borrower. Upon payment by a Borrower of any sums as provided above, all
rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or
otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in
cash of the Obligations.
