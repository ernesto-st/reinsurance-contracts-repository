                  2.01     Indebtedness Subject to this Agreement. All Senior
Indebtedness shall be entitled to the benefits of and subject to the obligations
set forth in this Agreement and shall be entitled to the liens, charges,
collateral assignments and security interests granted by or pursuant to the
Security Documents.

                  2.02     Senior Indebtedness Pari Passu. All Senior
Indebtedness shall rank pari passu without any preference among Senior
Indebtedness by reason of date of incurrence or otherwise.

                  2.03     Pro Rata Payment of Obligations. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, (a) each prepayment to a Senior Lender in respect of
the Senior Indebtedness, and (b) on and after the occurrence of an Event of
Default and the delivery of a Remedies Instruction as described in the
Intercreditor Agreement, each payment to a Senior Lender in respect of the
Senior Indebtedness, shall be on a Pro Rata Payment basis in accordance with the
respective interest, fees, commissions, indemnities, principal and other amounts
due to all of the Senior Lenders on the date of such payment or prepayment.

                  2.04     Additional Senior Indebtedness. From time to time the
Company may, subject to the terms hereof, designate additional indebtedness of
and commitments to lend to the Company made by financial institutions or vendors
of telecommunications equipment as Senior Indebtedness, and upon satisfaction of
each of the following conditions precedent such designated indebtedness and
commitments, for all purposes of this Agreement, shall be Senior Indebtedness
secured by the collateral subject to the Security Documents and entitled to the
benefits of this Agreement ("Additional Senior Indebtedness"):

                  (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section
2.04, the lenders of such Additional Senior Indebtedness (or an agent or
fiduciary representing such lenders) (the "Additional Senior Indebtedness
Lender") shall have executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent an agreement
in which each such lender agrees to be bound as a Senior Lender by all of


                                       3

                     Amended and Restated Common Agreement
<PAGE>
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Collateral Agency Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement as if it were a party hereto and thereto.

                  (b)      The Company shall have furnished to the Collateral
Agent and to each of the Alcatel Administrative Agent and the Qualcomm
Administrative Agent a term sheet describing the terms and conditions of the
proposed Additional Senior Indebtedness, a summary describing any and all
representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, events
of default and other non-financial terms which are to be imposed in connection
with the making of such Additional Senior Indebtedness and which are potentially
more restrictive on the Borrower Group than the provisions of this Agreement
(the "Further Provisions"), and as soon as practicable, drafts of the proposed
Credit Agreement and each of the other documents related thereto. Within 10
Business Days after the receipt of such term sheet and drafts of the Further
Provisions, the Alcatel Administrative Agent and the Qualcomm Administrative
Agent shall notify the Company, the Additional Senior Indebtedness Lender, the
Collateral Agent and each other such Administrative Agent whether they (acting
on behalf of, and at the instructions of, the Senior Lenders under their
respective Credit Agreements) agree to amend or supplement the provisions of
this Agreement to allow such Further Provisions to be incorporated herein; and,
if either of them (on behalf of the Senior Lenders under their respective Credit
Agreements) so agree, pursuant to the sole and absolute discretion of such
Senior Lenders, this Agreement shall be amended to include such Further
Provisions and each party hereto shall execute and deliver an amendment
implementing such Further Provisions, which amendment shall be in form
reasonably satisfactory to each such party; provided, that in no event shall any
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent be obligated to waive or modify any
provision of the Financing Agreements relating to the Collateral. If neither of
such Administrative Agents agrees to include such Further Provisions in this
Agreement, such Further Provisions may be included in the Credit Agreement under
which such Additional Senior Indebtedness is to be incurred and an "event of
default" thereunder shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder as set forth
in Section 7.15. Any and all Further Provisions related to any particular
Additional Senior Indebtedness, which Further Provisions were included in this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.04(b), shall terminate, and this Agreement
shall be amended to delete such Further Provisions, upon the full repayment or
refinancing of all of the obligations under such Additional Senior Indebtedness;
provided, however, that such Further Provisions shall remain in this Agreement
for the term hereof for the benefit of all Senior Lenders if, during the period
that such Further Provisions were in effect, (i) all or a portion of the Senior
Indebtedness under either of the Alcatel Credit Agreement or the Qualcomm Credit
Agreement was syndicated or participated without credit support from Alcatel or
its Affiliates or Qualcomm or its Affiliates, as applicable (the "Non-Recourse
Sold Amount") or (ii) credit support from Alcatel or its Affiliates or Qualcomm
or its Affiliates shall have been withdrawn with respect to all or a portion of
the commitments or obligations previously sold under the respective Credit
Agreement (the "Non-Recourse Withdrawal Amount"), such that the aggregate amount
of the Non-Recourse Sold Amount and the Non-Recourse Withdrawal Amount under
either Credit Agreement shall equal twenty five percent (25%) or more of the
initial Commitments under the applicable Credit Agreement; provided further,
that no Further Provisions shall terminate as described above to the extent such
Further Provisions are included within the instruments or agreements pursuant to
which such related Additional Senior Indebtedness is refinanced. Each of
Qualcomm and Alcatel shall be permitted to exercise their rights under this
Section 2.04(b) any number of times so long as Qualcomm or Alcatel, as the case
may be, shall be a Senior Lender providing

financing hereunder or a guarantor providing credit support therefor, in either
case, involving an aggregate amount equal to at least twenty five percent (25%)
percent of the Commitments or Loans under its respective Credit Agreement. It is
understood and agreed that for purposes hereof, the Commitment of Alcatel shall
include the commitment under the Alcatel Commitment Letter.

                  (c)      Any and all liens, collateral assignments, security
interests and charges which are to be given by the Borrower Group or their
shareholders in connection with such Additional Senior Indebtedness ("Additional
Collateral") shall be granted to the Collateral Agent (and the Security
Documents shall be amended or supplemented accordingly, or further security
documents shall be executed and delivered by the Borrower Group to grant such
Additional Collateral to the Collateral Agent), so that, following the issuance
of such Additional Senior Indebtedness, all of the Senior Indebtedness will be
secured on a pari passu basis.

                  (d)      Each member of the Borrower Group shall execute and
deliver a Guaranty Agreement in favor of the Additional Senior Indebtedness
Lender in such a manner that the Additional Senior Indebtedness is guaranteed
thereunder to the same extent as the other Senior Indebtedness at the time
outstanding is guaranteed; provided, however, that, the Company may arrange for
a guaranty or guarantees of such Additional Senior Indebtedness from a third
party or parties, other than other members of the Borrower Group (a "Third Party
Guarantor") without providing for a similar guaranty or guarantees of other
Senior Indebtedness, so long as (i) any representations, warranties, covenants
or defaults included in any reimbursement or similar agreement between any
member of the Borrower Group and the Third Party Guarantor shall constitute
Further Provisions for purposes of clause (b) of this Section 2.04, and (ii) no
collateral or other security may be given to such Third Party Guarantor by any
member of the Borrower Group other than in respect of subrogation rights, if
any, which such Third Party Guarantor may have in the Collateral and the
Security Documents, if and to the extent that it makes payments under such
guaranty.

                  (e)      At least five days prior to the issuance of the
Additional Senior Indebtedness, the Borrower Group shall have delivered to each
Administrative Agent a certificate (i) describing such Additional Senior
Indebtedness, (ii) stating that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is then continuing hereunder after giving full effect to the incurrence of such
Additional Senior Indebtedness, and (iii) stating that, following such issuance,
the Borrower Group will be in compliance with the provisions of this Section
2.04 and with the provisions of Section 6.04(d).

                  (f)      All of the conditions precedent to the Initial
Disbursement under the applicable Credit Agreement for such proposed Additional
Senior Indebtedness shall have been satisfied or waived pursuant to the terms of
such Credit Agreement.

                  2.05     Prepayments.

                  (a)      Prepayments of Senior Indebtedness shall be permitted
to the extent expressly provided in the applicable Credit Agreement and subject
to the limitations provided below.

                  (b)      Any prepayment of the principal amounts of any Senior
Indebtedness (other than (i) a prepayment of Non-Vendor Financing, (ii) a
prepayment of vendor financing from financing provided or supported by an export
credit agency, or (iii) a prepayment made under a revolving credit or similar
facility, including a voluntary prepayment of a Loan the proceeds of which were
used for the payment of VAT, provided that the lender's commitment thereunder is
not permanently reduced at the time of such prepayment) shall be accompanied by
a prepayment, on a Pro Rata Payment basis, of the principal amounts of all other
Senior Indebtedness then outstanding, (which prepayments shall be made
simultaneously unless any such Senior Indebtedness does not permit such
prepayment at such time or would otherwise require a prepayment or break-funding
penalty, in which case such prepayment amounts, at the option of the Company,
may be deposited with the applicable Administrative Agent, invested in Permitted
Investments, and applied to the prepayment of such Senior Indebtedness on the
first date permitted or as to which no prepayment or break-funding penalty would
be imposed) which prepayment (unless the option described in the foregoing
parenthetical shall be exercised) shall be accompanied by the full payment of
any prepayment premium, break-funding amounts or other amounts due and payable
under the applicable Credit Agreement in connection with such prepayment;
provided, that (x) no such prepayment of any other Senior Indebtedness shall be
required if the Senior Lenders holding such Senior Indebtedness agree to waive
such prepayment or if the Credit Agreement governing such Senior Indebtedness
does not permit such prepayment and (y) the amount of the Senior Indebtedness
which would be so prepaid (but for the foregoing clause (x)) shall not be
applied to the other Senior Indebtedness then outstanding.

                  (c)      Any prepayment of principal on any Senior
Indebtedness as described in Section 2.05(b) shall be accompanied in each case
with the full payment of all accrued and unpaid interest on such Senior
Indebtedness to the extent required under the applicable Credit Agreement.

                  (d)      Subject to Section 2.05(b), any prepayment of any
Senior Indebtedness which is made from the proceeds of other Indebtedness
("Refinancing Indebtedness") may be made on a non-Pro Rata Payment basis between
or among Senior Indebtedness; provided, however, that the documentation under
which such Refinancing Indebtedness (other than Refinancing Indebtedness
provided or supported by an export credit agency) is issued shall provide that
Senior Indebtedness may be prepaid by the Company on a non-Pro-Rata Payment
basis to the same extent as is set forth in this Section 2.05.

                  (e)      Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any mandatory prepayment of Senior
Indebtedness made pursuant to Section 3.2(f) of the Qualcomm Credit Agreement
shall: (i) be deemed a permitted prepayment for purposes of this Section 2.05;
(ii) not be subject to any of the qualifications or restrictions set forth in
this Section 2.05 or Section 2.01 of the Intercreditor Agreement, including,
without limitation, the qualification that requires a prepayment, on a Pro Rata
Payment basis, of the principal amounts of all other Senior Indebtedness
outstanding; (iii) be deemed an amount not subject to sharing pursuant to
Section 2.03 of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (iv) not be subject to the
provisions of Section 2.03.

                  2.06     Payments.

                  (a)      On each Payment Date, the Company shall make the
scheduled principal repayments of Senior Indebtedness due on such Payment Date
except to the extent that such repayments have been prepaid. Principal of the
Senior Indebtedness shall be payable in accordance with the applicable Credit
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth therein. If two or more Credit
Agreements set forth the same Payment Date at any one time, and the Company
shall not have sufficient funds on such date to make full payment of the Senior
Indebtedness amounts due on such date under the applicable Credit Agreements,
then the Company shall make payments to the Senior Lenders under such Credit
Agreements on a Pro Rata Payment basis (determined without regard to clause (z)
of the proviso of the definition of "Pro Rata Payment") in respect of the
amounts due on such date.

                  (b)      On each Payment Date, the Company shall pay accrued
and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Senior Indebtedness
outstanding under each Credit Agreement in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Credit Agreement.

                  (c)      All payments due under any Credit Agreement shall be
made by the Company pursuant to the terms of the applicable Credit Agreement, in
Dollars, as required under the applicable Credit Agreement, and in immediately
available funds. Subject to the provisions of the Collateral Agency Agreement
and Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant Administrative Agent shall apply each
payment with respect thereto received by it in accordance with such Credit
Agreement.

                  (d)      If at any time at which any Obligations are payable
to a Senior Lender such Senior Lender receives insufficient funds pursuant to
the applicable Credit Agreement to pay in full all Obligations payable to such
Senior Lender at such time, the funds so received by such Senior Lender at such
time shall be deemed to be applied as follows:

                           (i)      FIRST, to interest (including post-default
         interest) on the Senior Indebtedness held by such Senior Lender;

                           (ii)     SECOND, to principal of the Senior
         Indebtedness held by such Senior Lender; and

                           (iii)    THIRD, to fees, commissions, indemnities,
         expenses and all amounts (other than principal of and interest on the
         Senior Indebtedness) payable to such Senior Lender.

                  2.07     Swap Agreements as Senior Indebtedness. Subject to
any other restrictions otherwise contained in this Agreement, the Company may
enter into interest rate and Peso-Dollar currency swap agreements (including
collars, caps and similar derivative arrangements) through the execution of an
agreement, (a "Swap Agreement") with an Eligible Swap Counterparty; provided,
however, that all interest rate swap agreements shall be bona fide hedges of
floating rate exposure for a fixed rate obligation, shall have at any time a
notional amount not greater than the Company's floating rate Indebtedness
outstanding at such time, and cover a period not exceeding four years from any
date of determination; provided, further, that all currency swap agreements
shall be bona fide hedges for a term not exceeding four years and


                                       7

                     Amended and Restated Common Agreement
<PAGE>
for the purchase of Dollars or Pesos with notional amounts in the aggregate not
exceeding an amount equal to 33.0% of the outstanding Senior Indebtedness. The
Company may incur obligations under the Swap Agreement without regard to any
limitations imposed under Section 2.04 or Section 6.04. The obligations of the
Company under any such Swap Agreement may, upon notice by the Company to the
Collateral Agent, be secured by the Collateral on a pro-rata basis to the same
extent as would be the case if such obligations of the Company under such Swap
Agreement were deemed to be Additional Senior Indebtedness hereunder, in which
event the Security Documents shall be amended to the extent necessary to provide
for such pro-rata treatment of the swap counterparty in respect of such
Collateral; provided, however, that in such event (i) no member of the Borrower
Group shall, if the swap counterparty is secured as aforesaid, grant to such
swap counterparty any other Lien upon the property or assets of the Borrower
Group, (ii) the amount secured by the Collateral, as described in the preceding
sentence, shall be the amount owed from time to time by the Company under the
Swap Agreement, and (iii) the swap counterparty, in its capacity as such, shall
not otherwise be, or be deemed to be, a Senior Lender hereunder and shall have
no voting rights with respect to any matter described herein or in the other
Financing Agreements. Upon delivery of the notice to the Collateral Agent as
aforesaid, accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Finance Officer of the
Company stating that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then
continuing, the Collateral Agent shall amend or supplement the Security
Documents to implement the provisions of this Section 2.07.

         than the Credit Agreement by and among such Person, such Agent and such
         Senior Lender), shall be true, complete and correct in all material
         respects with the same force and effect as though such representations
         and warranties had been made on and as of the date of such

waiver by any Senior Lender or any Agent in connection with any condition of
Disbursement under this Agreement or any Credit Agreement shall impair any
right, power or remedy of any such Senior Lender or Agent with respect to any
other condition of Disbursement, or be construed to be a waiver of any such
other condition; nor shall the action of any Senior Lender or any Agent in
respect of any Disbursement affect or impair any right, power or remedy of any
Senior Lender or the Collateral Agent in respect of any other Disbursement.

                  (b)      Subject to Section 3.05, unless otherwise notified to

conditions precedent (i) to the Initial Disbursement or any subsequent

understood that any remedial action taken under the Security Documents, to the
extent that it results or would result, directly or indirectly, in a transfer of

Mexican Telecommunications Law. Solely for purposes of this Section 4.04, the

made, is validly issued, is in full force and effect, and is held in the name of
the Person identified in such Permit and is free from any condition or

respect to any member of the Borrower Group of any nature whatsoever (whether

the Closing Date, no member of the Borrower Group knows of any reasonable basis
for the assertion against any such member of any liability or obligation of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether or not due) for such relevant period that is not (x) fully reflected in
the financial statements referred to in Section 3.01(m), (y) set forth in

respect to any order of any court, arbitrator, administrative agency or other
Governmental Authority, other than any order that is the subject of a Good Faith

which, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. There is no injunction,
writ, or preliminary restraining order of any nature issued by an arbitrator,
court or other Governmental Authority directing that any of the transactions
provided for in any of the Financing Agreements not be consummated as herein or
therein provided. There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding
(including any appeal by any Person of a Permit) by or before any court,
arbitrator, administrative agency or other Governmental Authority pending or, to
the best knowledge of each member of the Borrower Group, threatened against or
affecting any member of the Borrower Group (or any of such party's properties,
revenues or assets) which constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      There are no strikes, slowdowns or work stoppages by
the employees of any member of the Borrower Group, on-going, or, to the best
knowledge of each such member, currently threatened, which constitute a Material

                  (b)      Except for those items set forth in Schedule 4.08, no

                  4.09     Capitalization. Schedule 4.09 sets forth the
capitalization of Holdings and each other member of the Borrower Group as of the
SPA Closing Date, including (i) authorized capital, (ii) the number of shares
issued and outstanding and (iii) the shareholders and number of shares and
advances held by each such shareholder. All of the issued and outstanding shares
of Holdings (other than treasury stock held by Holdings) and each other member
of the Borrower Group are duly and validly issued and non-assessable and fully
paid. As of the SPA Closing Date, neither Holdings nor any other member of the
Borrower Group has outstanding (a) any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for its share capital or (b) any rights to subscribe for or to
purchase, or any option for the purchase of, or any agreement, arrangement or
understanding providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any
call, commitment or claims of any character relating to, or any rights or claims
that restrict the transfer of, its share capital.

                  4.10     Subsidiaries, Mortgage and Minimum Assets.

                  (a)      Holdings is the legal and beneficial owner of 100% of
the Capital Stock of each of (i) the Company, (ii) Pegaso PCS, (iii) Personnel
Co., (iv) Finanzas and (v) Finco (the "Applicable Shares"). As of the SPA
Closing Date, Holdings does not own any Capital Stock in any Person other than
as set forth in the preceding sentence. There are no Liens of any kind on any of
the Applicable Shares other than Permitted Liens, nor are there any restrictions
on transfers of such Applicable Shares, nor are there any agreements of any kind
relating to the voting of, or disposition of, such Applicable Shares (except as
described in the proviso to Section 4.04(iv)). As of the SPA Closing Date, each
of the Company, Pegaso PCS, Personnel Co., Finanzas and Finco has no
Subsidiaries and does not otherwise control any voting stock or any ownership
interest in any other Person. All of the Capital Stock of each Subsidiary of
Holdings or of any other member of the Borrower Group acquired after the date of
this Agreement has been pledged by the relevant party to the Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Secured Parties as required by Section 5.14.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 4.10(a), it is recognized
that a single share of each of Pegaso PCS, Personnel Co., the Company, Finanzas
and Finco is not owned by Holdings, but is owned by another member of the
Borrower Group.

                  (b)      As of the SPA Closing Date, the Sponsors,

there any agreements of any kind relating to the voting of, or disposition of,
such Holdings Shares, other than as set forth in the Shareholders Agreement.

                  (c)      The Company is the legal and beneficial owner of all
of the properties, assets and contract rights which are specifically described
in the Mortgage as being the subject of the Lien created by the Mortgage. The
Mortgage has the effect of creating, in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Senior Lenders, a perfected and first priority Lien on all
property, assets and contract rights owned from time to time by the Company
(including property acquired by the Company after the date of execution,
delivery and recording of the Mortgage). Such properties, assets and contract
rights, at the time this representation is made or deemed made, constitute
Minimum Assets.

                  (d)      As of the SPA Closing Date, Schedule 4.10(d) lists

                  4.11     Compliance with Applicable Law. Each member of the
Borrower Group is in compliance in all respects with all Applicable Law
(including Environmental Law), except to the extent that such failure to be in
compliance would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

owns, has a license to use or otherwise has the right to use, free and clear of

rights (real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible) including all
patents, patent applications, trademarks, permits, service marks, names, trade
secrets, proprietary information and knowledge, technology, computer programs,
databases, copyrights, licenses, franchises and formulas, or rights with respect
thereto, and has obtained assignments of all leases and other rights of whatever
nature, in each case, that are material to the care, custody, control,
construction, development, operation and maintenance of the System or the
conduct of the Business by the Borrower Group as contemplated by the Business
Plan, without any conflict with the rights of others as of the date such
property rights are necessary to operate and maintain the System and the
Business.

                  4.13     Single-Purpose. The Borrower Group (taken as a whole)
has not engaged in any business other than the care, custody, control,
development, construction, operation, maintenance and financing of the System
and the conduct of the Business; provided, that it is recognized that Personnel
Co. is authorized to provide human resource and similar services, and may
provide such services, to unrelated third parties to the extent consistent with
the Original Business Plan.

executed and delivered as of the date this representation is made or deemed made
are each in proper legal form under (i) the Applicable Law of Mexico and (ii)
the respective governing laws selected in such Transaction Documents, for the
enforcement thereof in such jurisdiction.

                  4.15     Foreign Exchange Approvals. All requisite foreign
exchange control approvals and other similar authorizations, if any, required

effect. Other than those restrictions or requirements for which appropriate

exchange, for the purpose of (a) the performance by the Borrower Group of their
obligations under this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement or (b)
repatriating the proceeds of enforcement of the Obligations or the Collateral to
the Collateral Agent.

                  4.16     Liens. Except for Permitted Liens, there are no Liens
securing any Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person covering any
present or future revenues, properties or assets or share capital of any member
of the Borrower Group other than on the capital stock of Holdings. No Liens
securing any Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person cover the capital
stock of Holdings held by any Sponsor except as permitted under the Sponsor
Negative Pledge Agreement. No member of the Borrower Group has outstanding any
Lien or obligation to create any Lien on or with respect to any of its
properties, revenues or assets, other than Permitted Liens.

Mortgage, any and all property, assets and revenues specifically identified
therein), in all cases free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

                  (b)      The provisions of the Security Documents are
effective to create in favor of the Secured Parties a legal, valid and
enforceable first priority Lien on all of the property, assets and revenues
described therein (including, with respect to the Mortgage, any and all
property, assets and revenues specifically identified therein) to the extent a
security interest may be created therein under Applicable Law and all necessary

other Liens except for Permitted Liens, and consents to the creation,
effectiveness, priority and enforcement of such Liens have been obtained from
each of the parties to the Transaction Documents and the relevant Governmental
Authorities, other than as described in the proviso to Section 4.04(iv).

                  4.18     Transaction Documents. The Collateral Agent and each
Administrative Agent have received a true, complete and correct copy of each of
the Transaction Documents in effect as of the date this representation is made

writing to the Collateral Agent and each Administrative Agent and in accordance
with the terms hereof.

                  4.19     Certain Ancillary Services. Except where the failure
to obtain the services referred to below would not constitute a Material Adverse
Effect, all utility services, facilities and other services that can reasonably
be expected to be necessary for the care, custody, control, construction,
operation and maintenance of the System, are, or will be when needed, available
to the Borrower Group to the extent necessary or desirable, and arrangements in

within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

                  4.22     True and Complete Disclosure. (a) All factual
information (taken as a whole), including the Business Plan, furnished by or on
behalf of any member of the Borrower Group in writing to or for the benefit of
any particular Senior Lender (referred to herein as a "Relevant Lender," which
term includes the Collateral Agent or the applicable Administrative Agent under
the Credit Agreement to which such Relevant Lender is a party) was true and
accurate in all material respects (i) in the case of the Original Business Plan,
as of December 15, 1998, and (ii) with respect to all other factual information
(including updates of the Business Plan), on the dates as of which such
information was furnished, and was not incomplete by omitting to state any
material fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not
misleading in any material respect at such time in light of the circumstances
under which such information was furnished; provided, however, that, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the sole representation of each

expressions of view as to future circumstances shall be that such projections,
estimates or other expressions of view as to future circumstances (i) were
prepared in good faith, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the

were believed by the Borrower Group in good faith to be reasonable in light of
conditions existing at the time of preparation thereof, but that actual results
may vary from the projected results contained therein), (iii) were based on
reasonable assumptions as to all factual and legal matters material to the
estimates therein (including interest rates and costs) as of their respective
date(s) of delivery (or, in the case of the Original Business Plan, as of
December 15, 1998), and (iv) were in all material respects consistent with the
provisions of the Transaction Documents as of their respective date(s) of
delivery (or, in the case of the Original Business Plan, as of December 15,
1998). There are no statements, assumptions or conclusions in the Business Plan,
as of the date of delivery thereof, which are based upon or include information
known as such delivery date to any member of the Borrower Group to be misleading
or which fail to take into account material information regarding the matters
reported therein. As of the SPA Closing Date there are in existence no
documents, agreements or other information which have not been disclosed to the
Relevant Lender in writing which are material in the context of the Transaction
Documents or which have the effect of varying any of the Transaction Documents.

any Senior Indebtedness will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and
whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for any purpose which entails a
violation of, or which is inconsistent with Regulations T, U or X promulgated by
the Board of Governors of the

other contracts or instruments executed by Guarantors or the Company in
connection therewith and herewith (i) are not subordinated in right of payment

other than those set forth in the Licenses. The Licenses are sufficient
(together with other authorizations, consents and permits which have been
received, or are reasonably anticipated to be received on a timely basis, by one
or more members of the Borrower Group) to grant to the Company the legal power
and authority to operate and maintain the System and conduct the Business in
accordance with the Business Plan. Other than as may be set forth in Schedule
4.28, as of the SPA Closing Date, there has been no notice given by any
Governmental Authority that brings into question the validity or effectiveness
of the Licenses, nor is there any litigation (or to the best knowledge of each
member of the Borrower Group, threatened litigation) relating in any way to the
Licenses which, in either case, if decided adversely, would have the effect of
causing an Event of Default under Section 7.13.

         been timely made, except when the failure to maintain, operate, or
         administer, or to notify, file or disclose, would not have a Material
         Adverse Effect. No proceeding with respect to the administration or the

         routine claims for benefits) that would have a Material Adverse Effect
         or create Liens (other than Permitted Liens) is pending or threatened.

         respective employees have been timely paid and properly reported in the
         financial statements required to be delivered under Section 5.01(a) in

         would not have a Material Adverse Effect or create any Lien (other than
         Permitted Liens).

                           (iii)    As of the SPA Closing Date, the Borrower
         Group has no liability for retiree benefits.

in all respects with all Applicable Laws, rules and regulations with respect to
employment practices including, but not limited to, applicable health and safety
regulations and there is no charge or complaint alleging any material violation
of such laws, rules or regulations against any member of the Borrower Group
pending or threatened, or before any federal or local labor board, tribunal or
Comision Nacional del Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (National Savings and
Retirement System Commission), except where the failure to comply with such laws
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      Labor Matters. There is no labor strike, request for
representation, slowdown or stoppage actually pending or, to the knowledge of
any member of the Borrower Group, threatened against or affecting it which would

payer agreements, beneficiary materials and other documents (including, without
limitation, those related to employee benefit plans) required to be filed by it

insurance and health regulatory authorities except where the failure to file
would have a Material Adverse Effect or create a Lien.

                  4.31     [Intentionally Omitted].

                  4.32     Indebtedness. As of the SPA Closing Date, Schedule
4.32 is a complete and correct list of all Indebtedness, credit agreements,
indentures, purchase agreements, guaranties, capital leases and other
investments, agreements and arrangements presently in effect providing for or

notifies the Company and each Administrative Agent that it does not desire any
such prepayment from such amounts, then any prepayment referred to in this

         member of the Borrower Group in connection with any Transaction
         Document or any obligation owed to any Person, and (x) which do not in
         the aggregate materially detract from the value of such property or
         assets or materially impair the use thereof in the operation of the
         Business of the Borrower Group or (y) which are the subject of a Good
         Faith Contest by appropriate proceedings, which proceedings have the
         effect of preventing the forfeiture or sale of the property or asset
         subject to such Lien;

                           (iii)    Liens for taxes, assessments and other

acquisitions permitted under clause (g) below, in each case, during the period
from the date of receipt of such net proceeds by the Company through and
including the date that is 180 days thereafter, such excess shall be applied to
the prepayment of outstanding Senior Indebtedness on a Pro Rata Payment basis as
soon as may be practicable following the end of such 180-day period; provided,
however, that any sale, assignment, transfer, partition or other disposition of

in connection with acquisitions permitted under clause (g) below, in each case,
during the period from the date of receipt of such net proceeds by the Company

                  In connection with the sale or disposition of any License (or
portion thereof) or any other asset or property of a member of the Borrower
Group which is permitted under this Section 6.02 and which is then subject to a
Lien created by the Security Documents, the Collateral Agent shall execute such
documents of release as shall be reasonably requested by the Borrower Group in
order to release such Licenses (or portions thereof) or such other asset or
property from the Lien created by the Security Documents. If and to the extent
that any Senior Indebtedness then outstanding does not permit the prepayment
thereof at such time or under such circumstances as are described in clause (e)
or clause (f) of this Section 6.02, or any Senior Lender notifies the Company
and each Administrative Agent that it does not desire any such prepayment from
such sources, then any prepayment referred to in such clauses shall be applied
on a Pro Rata Payment basis as if such Senior Indebtedness was not then
outstanding. Any prepayment of Senior Indebtedness made in accordance with this
Section 6.02 shall be made simultaneously with the prepayment of other Senior
Indebtedness (other than as set forth in the preceding sentence), provided that
if such prepayment of any such Senior Indebtedness would

the option of the Company, be deposited with the applicable Administrative
Agent, invested in Permitted Investments, and applied to the prepayment of such
Senior Indebtedness on the first date as to which no prepayment or break-funding
penalty would be imposed.

                  6.03     Restricted Payments. No member of the Borrower Group
will declare or pay any dividends (other than dividends payable solely in
Capital Stock of such Person) or return any capital to, its stockholders or
authorize or make any other distribution, payment or delivery of property or
cash to its stockholders as such, or redeem, retire, purchase, or otherwise
acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration, any shares of any class of
its own Capital Stock now or hereafter outstanding (or any warrants for or

Subsidiaries to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
any class of the Capital Stock of any other member of the Borrower Group or any

respect to its capital stock) (all of the foregoing "Dividends"), except that
(A) any Subsidiary of the Company, Pegaso PCS, Personnel Co., Finanzas or Finco
may pay Dividends to the Company, Pegaso PCS, Personnel Co., Finanzas or Finco,
as applicable, (B) each of the Company, Pegaso PCS, Personnel Co., Finanzas or
Finco may pay cash Dividends to Holdings to the extent, but only to the extent,
that Holdings needs all of such Dividends within five Business Days following
the payment of such Dividend to pay (i) normal, reasonable and customary
administrative costs incurred in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) Taxes
paid in cash related to the Business on behalf of the Borrower Group, (iii) to

is paid and the Company reasonably believes that it has, or will have on each of
the next following Payment Dates applicable to each tranche of Senior
Indebtedness, cash or Permitted Investments equal to the debt service coming due
on such Payment Dates, interest on, and (subject to Section 6.04(h)(B))
regularly scheduled principal coming due on, High Yield Debt (issued by
Holdings) within such five Business Day-period (and any Dividends not so
utilized within such five Business Day-period shall be returned to the
appropriate Subsidiary of Holdings) and (iv) to the extent no Default or Event
of Default exists at the time of such payment, dividends by Holdings which are
permitted to be paid pursuant to clause (C) below, and (C) at any time during
any fiscal year, Holdings may pay Dividends to its shareholders provided that,
(1) the Cash Flow Test shall be satisfied as of the date of such Dividend
payment, (2) the EBITDA Test shall be less than or equal to 4.0 to 1 as of the
date of such Dividend payment; provided, that for purposes of this Section 6.03
the components of the EBITDA Test shall be calculated as follows: (x)
Consolidated Debt, cash and Permitted Investments shall be measured as of the
date of such Dividend payment and (y) EBITDA shall be measured based on the two
preceding fiscal quarters most recently ended, and (3) simultaneously with any
such Dividend payment, there shall be paid to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, as a prepayment of the principal amount of such Senior
Indebtedness then outstanding and on a Pro Rata Payment basis, an amount equal
to such Dividend multiplied by the ratio (expressed as a percentage of not less
than 100%) which (i) the total principal amount of Senior Indebtedness
outstanding on the date of such prepayment bears to (ii) the total Consolidated
Paid-In Equity as of such date, both calculated in a manner consistent with the
provisions of Section 6.10. If and to the extent that any Senior Indebtedness
then outstanding does not permit the prepayment thereof at such time or under
such circumstances as are described in this Section 6.03, or any Senior Lender
notifies the Company and each

Section 6.03 shall be made simultaneously with the prepayment of other Senior
Indebtedness (other than as set forth in the preceding sentence), provided that

Permitted Investments, and applied to the prepayment of such Senior Indebtedness
on the first date as to which no prepayment or break-funding penalty would be
imposed.

and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Secured Parties may,

Section 6.03 (a) (iv) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

                  (b)      Each member of the Borrower Group shall, whether or
not the transactions herein contemplated are consummated, jointly or severally,
indemnify each of the Secured Parties and their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives, attorneys and agents (each an "Indemnified Party"
and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and hold each of them
harmless against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements
incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related
to, or by reason of, any investigation, litigation or other proceeding or
inquiry (whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto) related to
the entering into and/or performance of any Transaction Document or the
disbursement of, or use of the proceeds of, any Senior Indebtedness or the
consummation of any transactions contemplated herein or in any Transaction
Document, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel selected by
such Indemnified Party incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding or in connection with enforcing the provisions of
this Section 8.01(b) (but excluding any such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and
disbursements to the extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified or its officers, directors,
employees, representatives, attorneys or agents, as the case may be, as
determined pursuant to a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction).

                  (c)      Without limitation to the provisions of Section
8.01(b) above, each member of the Borrower Group agrees to defend, protect,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and hold each of them
harmless against any and all liabilities (including removal and remedial

suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable attorneys' and

Environmental Claim relating to any member of the Borrower Group or the System
or any real property owned or leased by any member of the Borrower Group, or
(iii) the exercise of any Indemnified Party's rights under any of the provisions
of this Section

8.01, but excluding any matter based solely on the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any such Indemnified Party, as the case may be, as determined
pursuant to a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

                  (d)      To the extent that the undertaking in the preceding
paragraphs of this Section 8.01 may be unenforceable because it is violative of
any law or public policy, the Borrower Group will contribute the maximum portion
that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under Applicable Law to the payment and
satisfaction of such undertakings.

                  (e)      All sums paid and costs incurred by any Indemnified
Party with respect to any matter indemnified hereunder shall bear interest at
the default rate applicable to their respective Credit Facility from the date
any member of the Borrower Group receives notice thereof from such Indemnified
Party, until reimbursed by the Borrower Group, and all such sums and costs shall
be added to the debt and be secured by the Security Documents and shall be
immediately due and payable on demand. Each such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Company in a timely manner of any such amounts payable by
the Borrower Group hereunder, provided that any failure to provide such notice
shall not affect the Borrower Group's obligations under this Section 8.01.

                  (f)      Each Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.01(b)
and (c) above, within 10 days after the receipt by it of notice of the
commencement of any action for which indemnity may be sought by it, or by any
Person controlling it, from the Borrower Group on account of the agreements
contained in this Section 8.01, shall notify the Company in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the failure of such Indemnified Party to so notify the
Company of any such action shall not release the Borrower Group from any
liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party.

                  8.02     Right of Setoff. Subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, each Senior Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Senior Lender to
or for the credit or the account of any member of the Borrower Group against any
and all of the obligations of the Borrower Group now or hereafter existing under
the applicable Credit Agreement and, if applicable, the corresponding Note held
by such Senior Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Senior Lender shall
have made any demand under the applicable Credit Agreement or Note, and without
presentment, protest or other notice of any kind to any member of the Borrower
Group, all of which are hereby expressly waived and although such obligations
may be unmatured.

                  8.03     Notices.

                  (a)      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in
any Financing Agreement, all notices and other communications provided for
hereunder or thereunder shall be (i) in writing (including telex or telecopier)
and (ii) telexed, telecopied or sent by overnight courier (if for inland
delivery) or international courier (if for overseas delivery) to a party hereto
(with a copy to the Relevant Party) or to a Relevant Party at its address and
contact number

specified in Schedule 8.03, or at such other address and contact number as is
designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto.

                  (b)      All such notices and communications shall be
effective (i) if sent by telex, when sent (with the correct answer back), (ii)
if sent by telecopier, when sent (on receipt of confirmation) and (iii) if sent
by courier, (x) one Business Day after deposit with an overnight courier if for
inland delivery and (y) three days after deposit with an international courier
if for overseas delivery.

                  8.04     Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, no member of the Borrower
Group may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of each of the Senior Lenders. Any Senior Lender may
transfer, assign or grant its rights hereunder in connection with an assignment
or transfer of all or any part of its interest in its Senior Indebtedness in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Credit Agreement, provided that
any such assignee has agreed to be bound by the terms of the Financing
Agreements, including the Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any Financing Agreement (including this Agreement),
the Senior Lenders under each respective Credit Agreement shall be entitled to
appoint a successor administrative agent in accordance with the terms of such
Credit Agreement upon the resignation or removal of their Administrative Agent
without any consent of or notice to any other Secured Party, and upon such
appointment becoming effective in accordance with such terms, such successor
shall be deemed to be the "Administrative Agent" of such Senior Lenders for all
purposes of this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements. Each of the
Relevant Parties shall be deemed a third party beneficiary to this Agreement to
the extent that it is to receive any document, instrument, notification or other
paper as provided herein.

                  8.05     No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay
on the part of the Collateral Agent, any other Agent, or any Senior Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Financing
Agreement and no course of dealing between any member of the Borrower Group, or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent, any other
Agent and the Senior Lenders, on the other hand, shall impair any such right,
power or privilege or operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Financing Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The
rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Financing Agreement expressly
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies
which any party thereto would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on a member
of the Borrower Group in any case shall entitle such member (or any other
member) to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Collateral Agent, any
other Agent, or any Senior Lender to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

                  8.06     Severability. Any provision of any Financing
Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of prohibition or
unenforceability, but that shall not invalidate the remaining provisions of such
Financing Agreement or affect such provision in any other jurisdiction.

<PAGE>
                  8.07     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate
counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be effective for
purposes of binding the parties hereto, but all of which shall together
constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all
the parties hereto shall be lodged with each of the parties hereto.

                  8.08     Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective
as of September 10, 2002, concurrently with the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6
to the Qualcomm Credit Agreement, Amendment No. 4 to the Alcatel Credit
Agreement and Amendment No. 2 to the Facility 2 Credit Agreement. Any Credit
Agreement shall become effective pursuant to its terms (except for this
Agreement having become effective, if that is a condition of effectiveness of
any of such agreement).

                  8.09     Survival. All indemnities set forth herein, including
in Section 8.01, shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the making and repayment of the Senior Indebtedness.

                  8.10     Currency of Payment. The obligation of the Company
and the Borrower Group to pay in Dollars those amounts of the sums specified to
be due in Dollars, under this Agreement or the respective Financing Agreements
(the "Financing Agreement Currency") shall not be deemed to have been novated,
discharged or satisfied by any tender of (or recovery under judgment expressed
in) any currency other than the Financing Agreement Currency, except to the
extent to which such tender (or recovery) shall result in the effective payment
of such aggregate amount in the applicable Financing Agreement Currency at the
place where such payment is to be made and, accordingly, the amount (if any) by
which any such tender (or recovery) shall fall short of such amount shall be and
remain due to the Senior Lenders as a separate Obligation, unaffected by
judgment having been obtained (if such is the case) for any other amounts due in
respect of this Agreement or the Financing Agreements.

                  8.11     Judgment Currency.

                  (a)      The obligations of the Borrower Group hereunder and
under the other Financing Agreements to make payments in Dollars (the
"Obligation Currency"), shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or
recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency
other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or
recovery results in the effective receipt by the respective Secured Party of the
full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to such Secured
Party under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. If for the
purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Company in any court or
in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency
other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter
referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due in the Obligation
Currency, the conversion shall be made at the Peso Equivalent, in the case of
Pesos, and in the case of other currencies, the rate of exchange (as quoted by
the Intercreditor Agent or if the Intercreditor Agent fails to quote a rate of
exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such currency designated by the
Intercreditor Agent) determined, in each case, as of the day on which the
judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the
"Judgment Currency Conversion Date").

                     Amended and Restated Common Agreement
<PAGE>
                  (b)      If there is a change in the rate of exchange
prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual
payment of the amount due, the Borrower Group covenants to pay, or cause to be
paid, such additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as
may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.

                  (c)      For purposes of determining the Peso Equivalent or
rate of exchange under this Section 8.11, such amounts shall include any premium
and costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

                  8.12     Evidence of Debt.

                  (a)      Each Senior Lender shall maintain, or cause to be
maintained, in accordance with its usual practice, internal records evidencing
the amounts from time to time lent by and owing to it under its respective
Financing Agreement and each of the payments from time to time made in respect
thereof.

                  (b)      Except as otherwise provided in any Financing
Agreement, in any legal action or proceeding arising out of or in connection
with any Financing Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the entries made
in the internal records maintained by each of the Senior Lenders pursuant to
clause (a) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of
obligations of the Borrower Group as therein recorded.

                  8.13     English Language. This Agreement is made in the
English language. One Spanish language translation of this Agreement prepared at
the Company's expense by an official public interpreter and approved by Mexican
counsel to the Company and Mexican counsel to the Senior Lenders under the
Alcatel Credit Agreement and the Qualcomm Credit Agreement shall be the agreed
Spanish language translation hereof for all purposes. Such translation and no
other may be filed in one or more public registries in Mexico or used in any
proceeding in Mexico. For all purposes, the English language version hereof
shall be the original instrument and in all cases of conflict between the
English and the Spanish versions, the English version shall control.

                  8.14     Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
exhibits, schedules and appendices attached hereto), including the documents
referred to herein, embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings of the
parties hereto relating to the subject matter herein contained.

                  8.15     Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. Each member of the
