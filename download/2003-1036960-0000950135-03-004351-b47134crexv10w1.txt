repaid with the proceeds of, and simultaneously with the incurrence of, the
respective incurrence of Revolving Loans) then outstanding, equals the Revolving
Loan Commitment of such Lender at such time.

      (c) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Swingline Lender agrees to make, at any time and from time to time on or after
the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the Swingline Expiry Date, a revolving
loan or revolving loans (each a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the
"Swingline Loans") to the Borrower, which Swingline Loans (i) shall be incurred
and maintained as Base Rate Loans, (ii) shall be denominated in Dollars, (iii)
may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof, (iv)
shall not exceed in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding, when
combined with the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans (exclusive
of Revolving Loans which are repaid with the proceeds of, and simultaneously
with the incurrence of, the respective incurrence of Swingline Loans) then
outstanding and the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings
(exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid with the proceeds of, and
simultaneously with the incurrence of, the respective incurrence of Swingline
Loans) at such time, an amount equal to the Total Revolving Loan Commitment at
such time, and (v) shall not exceed in aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding the Maximum Swingline Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 1.01(c), (i) the Swingline Lender shall not
be obligated to make any Swingline Loans at a time when a Lender Default exists
with respect to an RL Lender unless the Swingline Lender has entered into
arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swingline
Lender's risk with respect to the Defaulting RL Lender's or Defaulting RL
Lenders' participation in such Swingline Loans,

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's or Defaulting RL
Lenders' RL Percentage of the outstanding Swingline Loans, and (ii) the
Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline Loan after it has received written
notice from the Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders stating
that a Default or an Event of Default exists and is continuing until such time
as the Swingline Lender shall have received written notice (A) of rescission of
all such notices from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or
notices or (B) of the waiver of such Default or Event of Default by the Required
Lenders.

      (d) On any Business Day, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole discretion,
give notice to the RL Lenders that the Swingline Lender's outstanding Swingline
Loans shall be funded with one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans (provided
that such notice shall be deemed to have been automatically given upon the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 or upon the
exercise of any of the remedies provided in the last paragraph of Section 10),
in which case one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans constituting Base Rate
Loans (each such Borrowing, a "Mandatory Borrowing") shall be made on the
immediately succeeding Business Day by all RL Lenders pro rata based on each
such RL Lender's RL Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to the last paragraph of
Section 10) and the proceeds thereof shall be applied directly by the Swingline
Lender to repay the Swingline Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each
RL Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make Revolving Loans upon one Business
Day's notice pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the
manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing
by the Swingline Lender notwithstanding (i) the amount of the Mandatory
Borrowing may not comply with the Minimum Borrowing Amount otherwise required
hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 6 are then
satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) the
date of such Mandatory Borrowing, and (v) the amount of the Total Revolving Loan
Commitment at such time. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for
any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without
limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to the Borrower), then each RL Lender hereby agrees that it
shall forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise
have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from the Borrower on or
after such date and prior to such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such
participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause
the RL Lenders to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon their
respective RL Percentages (determined before giving effect to any termination of
the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 10),
provided that (x) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the
account of the Swingline Lender until the date as of which the respective
participation is required to be purchased and, to the extent attributable to the
purchased participation, shall be payable to the participant from and after such
date and (y) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this
sentence is actually made, the purchasing RL Lender shall be required to pay the
Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of participation purchased for
each day from and including the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing would
otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such
participation, at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and
at the interest rate otherwise applicable to Revolving Loans maintained as Base
Rate Loans hereunder for each day thereafter.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
      1.02 Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing. The aggregate principal amount of
each Borrowing of Loans under a respective Tranche shall not be less than the
Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable to such Tranche. More than one Borrowing may
occur on the same date, but at no time shall there be outstanding more than ten
Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans in the aggregate for all Tranches of Loans.

      1.03 Notice of Borrowing. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur (x)
Eurodollar Loans hereunder, it shall give the Administrative Agent at the Notice
Office at least three Business Days' prior notice of each Eurodollar Loan to be
incurred hereunder and (y) Base Rate Loans hereunder (excluding Swingline Loans
and Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing), it shall give the
Administrative Agent at the Notice Office at least one Business Day's prior
notice of each Base Rate Loan to be incurred hereunder, provided that (in each
case) any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only
if given before 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on such day. Each such notice (each a
"Notice of Borrowing"), except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 1.10,
shall be irrevocable and shall be in writing, or by telephone promptly confirmed
in writing, in the form of Exhibit A-1, appropriately completed to specify: (i)
the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be incurred pursuant to such
Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day),
(iii) whether the Loans being incurred pursuant to such Borrowing shall
constitute Term Loans or Revolving Loans and (iv) whether the Loans being
incurred pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially maintained as Base Rate
Loans or, to the extent permitted hereunder, Eurodollar Loans and, if Eurodollar
Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly give each Lender which is required to make Loans of the
Tranche specified in the respective Notice of Borrowing, notice of such proposed
Borrowing, of such Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other matters
required by the immediately preceding sentence to be specified in the Notice of
Borrowing.

      (b) (i) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Swingline Loans hereunder,
the Borrower shall give the Swingline Lender no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York
time) on the date that a Swingline Loan is to be incurred, written notice or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing of each Swingline Loan to be
incurred hereunder. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and specify in each
case (A) the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), and (B) the
aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans to be incurred pursuant to
such Borrowing.

      (ii) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in
Section 1.01(d), with the Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by its incurrence of
any Swingline Loan, to the making of the Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in
Section 1.01(d).

      (c) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm
in writing any telephonic notice of any Borrowing or prepayment of Loans, the
Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, may act
without liability upon the basis of telephonic notice of such Borrowing or
prepayment, as the case may be, believed by the Administrative Agent or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be, in good faith to be from the president,
the chief executive officer or a Financial Officer, of the Borrower, or from any
other authorized officer of the Borrower designated in writing by the Borrower
to the Administrative Agent as being authorized to give such notices, prior to
receipt of written confirmation. In each

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative
Agent's or Swingline Lender's record of the terms of such telephonic notice of
such Borrowing or prepayment of Loans, as the case may be, absent manifest
error.

      1.04 Disbursement of Funds. No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the
date specified in each Notice of Borrowing (or (x) in the case of Swingline
Loans, no later than 4:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date specified pursuant to
Section 1.03(b)(i) or (y) in the case of Mandatory Borrowings, no later than
1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date specified in Section 1.01(d)), each Lender
with a Commitment of the respective Tranche will make available its pro rata
portion (determined in accordance with Section 1.07) of each such Borrowing
requested to be made on such date (or in the case of Swingline Loans, the
Swingline Lender will make available the full amount thereof). All such amounts
will be made available in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the
Payment Office, and the Administrative Agent will, except in the case of
Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing, make available to the
Borrower at the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available by
the Lenders. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any
Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to
be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing
and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If
such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay
such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand
therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover on demand from
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made
available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per
annum equal to (i) if recovered from such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds
Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate otherwise applicable to
such Loans for each day thereafter, and (ii) if recovered from the Borrower, the
rate of interest applicable to the respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant
to Section 1.08. Nothing in this Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to make Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights
which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any failure by
such Lender to make Loans hereunder.

      1.05 Notes. (a) The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and
interest on, the Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced in the Register
maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.15 and shall, if
requested by such Lender, also be evidenced (i) in the case of Term Loans, by a
promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the
form of Exhibit B-1, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith
(each a "Term Note" and, collectively, the "Term Notes"), (ii) in the case of
Revolving Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2, with blanks appropriately
completed in conformity herewith (each a "Revolving Note" and, collectively, the
"Revolving Notes"), and (iii) in the

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
case of Swingline Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B-3, with blanks appropriately
completed in conformity herewith (the "Swingline Note").

      (b) The Term Note issued to each Lender that has a Term Loan Commitment or
outstanding Term Loans shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to
such Lender or its registered assigns and be dated the Initial Borrowing Date
(or, if issued after the Initial Borrowing Date, be dated the date of issuance
thereof), (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Term Loans made by
such Lender on the Initial Borrowing Date (or, if issued after the Initial
Borrowing Date, be in a stated principal amount equal to the outstanding Term
Loans of such Lender at such time) and be payable in the outstanding principal
amount of Term Loans evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the Term Loan Maturity
Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 1.08 in
respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans, as the case may be,
evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in
Section 4.01, and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02, and (vii) be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

      (c) The Revolving Note issued to each Lender that has a Revolving Loan
Commitment or outstanding Revolving Loans shall (i) be executed by the Borrower,
(ii) be payable to such Lender or its registered assigns and be dated the
Initial Borrowing Date (or, if issued after the Initial Borrowing Date, be dated
the date of the issuance thereof), (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal
to the Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender (or, if issued after the
termination thereof, be in a stated principal amount equal to the outstanding
Revolving Loans of such Lender at such time) and be payable in the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate
clause of Section 1.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans,
as the case may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment
as provided in Section 4.01, and mandatory repayment as provided in Section
4.02, and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents.

      (d) The Swingline Note issued to the Swingline Lender shall (i) be
executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to the Swingline Lender or its
registered assigns and be dated the Initial Borrowing Date, (iii) be in a stated
principal amount equal to the Maximum Swingline Amount and be payable in the
outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loans evidenced thereby from time
to time, (iv) mature on the Swingline Expiry Date, (v) bear interest as provided
in the appropriate clause of Section 1.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans
evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in
Section 4.01, and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02, and (vii) be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

      (e) Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of each Loan
made by it and each payment in respect thereof and prior to any transfer of any
of its Notes will endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal
amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation or any
error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of
such Loans.

                                      -6-

<PAGE>
            (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this
Section 1.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to
Lenders which at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No
failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans to the
Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the Borrower to
pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) incurred by the Borrower which would
otherwise be evidenced thereby in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement, and shall not in any way affect the security or guaranties therefor
provided pursuant to the various Credit Documents. Any Lender which does not
have a Note evidencing its outstanding Loans shall in no event be required to
make the notations otherwise described in preceding clause (e). At any time when
any Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence any of its Loans, the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender, at the
Borrower's expense, the requested Note in the appropriate amount or amounts to
evidence such Loans.

            1.06 Conversions. The Borrower shall have the option to convert, on
any Business Day, all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum Borrowing
Amount of the outstanding principal amount of Loans (other than Swingline Loans
which may not be converted pursuant to this Section 1.06) made pursuant to one
or more Borrowings (so long as of the same Tranche) of one or more Types of
Loans into a Borrowing (of the same Tranche) of another Type of Loan, provided
that (i) no partial conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding
principal amount of such Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to
less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, (ii) unless the
Required Lenders otherwise agree, Base Rate Loans may only be converted into
Eurodollar Loans if no Specified Default or Event of Default is in existence on
the date of the conversion, (iii) unless the Agents otherwise agree in their
sole discretion or have determined that the Syndication Date has occurred (at
which time this clause (iii) shall no longer be applicable), prior to the 90th
day following the Initial Borrowing Date, conversions of Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the provisions of clause (B) of the proviso
in each of Sections 1.01(a)(iii) and 1.01(b)(ii), and (iv) no conversion
pursuant to this Section 1.06 shall result in a greater number of Borrowings of
Eurodollar Loans than is permitted under Section 1.02. Each such conversion
shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the
Notice Office prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) at least three Business Days'
prior notice (each a "Notice of Conversion/Continuation") in the form of Exhibit
A-2, appropriately completed to specify the Loans to be so converted, the
Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were incurred and, if to be
converted into Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of any
such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans. Upon any such conversion
the proceeds thereof will be deemed to be applied directly on the day of such
conversion to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans being
converted.

            1.07 Pro Rata Borrowings. All Borrowings of Term Loans and Revolving
Loans under this Agreement shall be incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the
basis of their Term Loan Commitments or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case
may be, provided that all Mandatory Borrowings shall be incurred from the RL
Lenders pro rata on the basis of their RL Percentages. It is understood that no
Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender of its
obligation to


                                      -7-
<PAGE>
make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans
provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other
Lender to make its Loans hereunder.

            1.08 Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of
the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date of Borrowing
thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar
Loan pursuant to Section 1.06 or 1.09, as applicable, at a rate per annum which
shall be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate each as in
effect from time to time.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan from the date of Borrowing thereof
until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan
pursuant to Section 1.06, 1.09 or 1.10, as applicable, at a rate per annum which
shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of
the Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such Interest Period
plus the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

            (c) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of each Loan shall, in each case, bear interest at a rate
per annum equal to the greater of (x) the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate
then borne by such Loans and (y) the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate
otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans of the respective Tranche from time to
time, and all other overdue amounts payable hereunder and under any other Credit
Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2%
in excess of the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained at Base
Rate Loans from time to time. Interest that accrues under this Section 1.08(c)
shall be payable on demand.

            (d) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i)
in respect of each Base Rate Loan, (x) quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date, (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment in full of all
outstanding Base Rate Loans of any Tranche, and (z) at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand, and (ii) in
respect of each Eurodollar Loan, (x) on the last day of each Interest Period
applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three
months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after the first day of
such Interest Period, and (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment (on the
amount repaid or prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise)
and, after such maturity, on demand.

            (e) Upon each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative Agent
shall determine the Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period applicable to the
respective Eurodollar Loans and shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final
and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

            1.09 Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of the making of, or
conversion into, any Eurodollar Loan (in the case of the initial Interest Period
applicable thereto) or prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the third Business
Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar
Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the Borrower


                                      -8-
<PAGE>
shall have the right to elect the interest period (each an "Interest Period")
applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option
of the Borrower (but otherwise subject to the provisions of clause (B) of the
proviso in each of Sections 1.01(a)(iii) and 1.01(b)(ii)), be a one, two, three
or six month period, provided that (in each case):

            (i) all Eurodollar Loans comprising a Borrowing shall at all times
      have the same Interest Period;

            (ii) the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan shall
      commence on the date of Borrowing of such Eurodollar Loan (including the
      date of any conversion thereto from a Base Rate Loan) and each Interest
      Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Eurodollar Loan shall
      commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable
      thereto expires;

            (iii) if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan begins on a day
      for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month
      at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the
      last Business Day of such calendar month;

            (iv) if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise
      expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall
      expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if any
      Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise expire on a day
      which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no
      further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall
      expire on the next preceding Business Day;

            (v) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no Interest Period
      may be selected at any time when a Specified Default or an Event of
      Default is then in existence; and

            (vi) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of any Tranche
      of Loans shall be selected which extends beyond the respective Maturity
      Date for such Tranche of Loans.

If by 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the third Business Day prior to the
expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans,
the Borrower has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new Interest
Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans as provided above, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate
Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.

            1.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that any
Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error,
be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to
clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

            (i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any
      changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the interbank
      Eurodollar market, adequate and


                                      -9-
<PAGE>
      fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on
      the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or

            (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
      reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
      any Eurodollar Loan because of (x) any change since the Effective Date in
      any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or
      request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation
      or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or
      governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, but
      not limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payment to any
      Lender of the principal of or interest on the Loans or the Notes or any
      other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on,
      or determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such
      Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized
      or in which its principal office or applicable lending office is located
      or any subdivision thereof or therein) or (B) a change in official reserve
      requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under
      Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurodollar
      Rate and/or (y) other circumstances arising since the Effective Date
      affecting such Lender, the interbank Eurodollar market or the position of
      such Lender in such market; or

            (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar
      Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule,
      regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in good
      faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law)
      or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the
      Effective Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank
      Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i)
above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).
Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer
be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the
Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation given by the Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans
which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be
deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the
Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon such Lender's written request
therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender
for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable
hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender,
showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to
the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause
(iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section
1.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period
required by law.


                                      -10-

            (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii), the Borrower may, and in the
case of a Eurodollar Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section
1.10(a)(iii), the Borrower shall, either (x) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is
then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel such Borrowing by
giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the
same date that the Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the
affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days'
written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to
convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided that, if more than
one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated
the same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).

            (c) If any Lender determines that after the Effective Date the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule,
regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or
administration thereof by the NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank
or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's Commitments
hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such
Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be
required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased
cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of
return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of
capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably
and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are
reasonable, provided that such Lender's determination of compensation owing
under this Section 1.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive
and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in
reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.

            1.11 Compensation. The Borrower agrees to compensate each Lender,
upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for requesting such compensation), for all losses, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but excluding loss of
anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other
than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of, or
conversion from or into, Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation (whether
or not withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section
1.10(a)); (ii) if any prepayment or repayment (including any prepayment or
repayment made pursuant to Section 4.01, Section 4.02 or as a result of an
acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 10) or conversion of any of its
Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest
Period with respect thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar
Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the
Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to
repay Eurodollar


                                      -11-
<PAGE>
Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note held by such
Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b).

            1.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that on the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or
(iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with respect to such
Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject
to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending
office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, provided that
such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office
suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of
avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such
Section. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or postpone any of the
obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections
1.10, 2.06 and 4.04.

            1.13 Replacement of Lenders. (x) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender or otherwise defaults in its obligations to make Loans, (y) upon the
occurrence of an event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or
(iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with respect to any Lender
which results in such Lender charging to the Borrower increased costs in excess
of those being generally charged by the other Lenders or (z) in the case of a
refusal by a Lender to consent to certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges
or terminations with respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the
Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the
Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default then exists
(or, in the case of preceding clause (z), will exist immediately after giving
effect to such replacement), to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with
one or more other Eligible Transferees, none of whom shall constitute a
Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the
"Replacement Lender") and each of whom shall be required to be reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent, provided that (i) at the time of any
replacement pursuant to this Section 1.13, the Replacement Lender shall enter
into one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section
13.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 13.04(b) to be paid
by the Replacement Lender and/or the Replaced Lender (as may be agreed to at
such time by and among the Borrower, the Replacement Lender and the Replaced
Lender)) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the
Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and in each case participations in Letters
of Credit by, the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to (x)
the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of (I) an
amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding
Loans of the Replaced Lender, (II) an amount equal to all Unpaid Drawings that
have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with
all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time, and (III) an amount
equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Lender
pursuant to Section 3.01, (y) each Issuing Lender an amount equal to such
Replaced Lender's RL Percentage of any Unpaid Drawing (which at such time
remains an Unpaid Drawing) to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded
by such Replaced Lender to such Issuing Lender and (z) the Swingline Lender an
amount equal to such Replaced Lender's RL Percentage of any Mandatory Borrowing
to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such Replaced Lender to
the Swingline Lender and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower due and owing to
the Replaced Lender at such time (other than those specifically described in
clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or
is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective


                                      -12-
<PAGE>
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the payment of amounts referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender,
delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with
respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01), which shall
survive as to such Replaced Lender.

            SECTION 2. Letters of Credit.

            2.01 Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request that an Issuing Lender
issue, at any time and from time to time on and after the Initial Borrowing Date
and prior to the 30th day prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, for the
account of the Borrower and for the benefit of (x) any holder (or any trustee,
agent or other similar representative for any such holders) of L/C Supportable
Obligations, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such Issuing Lender or in such other form as is reasonably acceptable to such
Issuing Lender, and (y) sellers of goods to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, an irrevocable trade letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such Issuing Lender or in such other form as has been approved by such
Issuing Lender (each such letter of credit, a "Letter of Credit" and,
collectively, the "Letters of Credit"). All Letters of Credit shall be
denominated in Dollars and shall be issued on a sight basis only. It is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that each of the letters of credit described in Schedule
II (the "Existing Letters of Credit"), which were issued by CSFB under the
Existing Credit Agreement and remain outstanding on the Initial Borrowing Date,
shall constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement and
shall be deemed issued under this Agreement on the Initial Borrowing Date.

            (b) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Issuing Lender agrees that it will, at any time and from time to time on
and after the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the 30th day prior to the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date, following its receipt of the respective Letter of
Credit Request, issue for account of the Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit
as are permitted to remain outstanding hereunder without giving rise to a
Default or an Event of Default, provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under
any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit of the types described above if at
the time of such issuance:

            (i) any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or
      arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing
      Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement of law
      applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or
      not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with
      jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such
      Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
      or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing
      Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or
      capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise
      compensated hereunder) not in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender
      on the date hereof, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was
      not applicable or in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender as of the
      date hereof and which such Issuing Lender reasonably and in good faith
      deems material to it; or


                                      -13-
<PAGE>
            (ii) such Issuing Lender shall have received from the Borrower, any
      other Credit Party or the Required Lenders prior to the issuance of such
      Letter of Credit notice of the type described in the second sentence of
      Section 2.03(b).

            2.02 Maximum Letter of Credit Outstandings; Final Maturities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no
Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the
Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid on
the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Letter of Credit) at
such time would exceed either (x) $50,000,000 or (y) when added to the sum of
(I) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans then outstanding and
(II) the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans then outstanding, an
amount equal to the Total Revolving Loan Commitment at such time, and (ii) each
Letter of Credit shall by its terms terminate (x) in the case of standby Letters
of Credit, on or before the earlier of (A) the date which occurs 12 months after
the date of the issuance thereof (although any such standby Letter of Credit
shall be extendible for successive periods of up to 12 months, but, in each
case, not beyond the fifth Business Day prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity
Date, on terms acceptable to the respective Issuing Lender) and (B) five
Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, and (y) in the case of
trade Letters of Credit, on or before the earlier of (A) the date which occurs
180 days after the date of issuance thereof and (B) 15 days prior to the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date.

            2.03 Letter of Credit Requests; Minimum Stated Amount. (a) Whenever
the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, the
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lender
at least five Business Days' (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such
Issuing Lender) written notice thereof (including by way of facsimile). Each
notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C, appropriately completed (each a
"Letter of Credit Request").

            (b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to
be a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Lenders that such Letter
of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the
requirements of, Section 2.02. Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received
notice from the Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders before
it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in
Section 5 or 6 are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of
Credit would violate Section 2.02, then such Issuing Lender shall, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit
for the account of the Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual
and customary practices. Upon the issuance of or modification or amendment to
any standby Letter of Credit, each Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such issuance, modification
or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of
Credit or the respective modification or amendment thereto, as the case may be.
Promptly after receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Participants, in writing, of such issuance, modification or amendment. On the
first Business Day of each week, each Issuing Lender shall furnish the
Administrative Agent with a written (including via facsimile) report of the
daily aggregate outstandings of trade Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender for the immediately preceding week. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that a Lender Default exists
with respect to an RL Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to


                                      -14-
<PAGE>
issue any Letter of Credit unless such Issuing Lender has entered into
arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Issuing
Lender's risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit by the
Defaulting Lender or Lenders, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting
Lender's or Lenders' RL Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings.

            (c) The initial Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall not be
less than $50,000 or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the respective
Issuing Lender.

            2.04 Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon the
issuance by an Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall
be deemed to have sold and transferred to each RL Lender, and each such RL
Lender (in its capacity under this Section 2.04, a "Participant") shall be
deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such
Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
participation, to the extent of such Participant's RL Percentage, in such Letter
of Credit, each drawing or payment made thereunder and the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or
guaranty pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Revolving Loan Commitments
or RL Percentages of the RL Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04(b), it is
hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid
Drawings relating thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the
participations pursuant to this Section 2.04 to reflect the new RL Percentages
of the assignor and assignee RL Lender, as the case may be.

            (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, no
Issuing Lender shall have any obligation relative to the other Lenders other
than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of
Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially
comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action
taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with
any Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such Issuing Lender any
resulting liability to the Borrower, any other Credit Party, any Lender or any
other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision).

            (c) In the event that an Issuing Lender makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such
amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(a), such Issuing
Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly
notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and
unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant's RL
Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds. If the
Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on any
Business Day, any Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of
Credit, such Participant shall make available to the respective Issuing Lender
in Dollars such Participant's RL Percentage of the amount of such payment on
such Business Day in same day funds. If and to the extent such Participant shall
not have so made its RL Percentage of the amount of such payment available to
the respective Issuing Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to such Issuing
Lender, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for
each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing
Lender at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three


                                      -15-
<PAGE>
days and at the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained
as Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter. The failure of any Participant to
make available to an Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall not relieve any other
Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to such Issuing Lender
its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date
required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Participant to make available to such Issuing Lender such
other Participant's RL Percentage of any such payment.

            (d) Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a reimbursement
obligation as to which it has received any payments from the Participants
pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Lender shall pay to each such
Participant which has paid its RL Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in same day
funds, an amount equal to such Participant's share (based upon the proportionate
aggregate amount originally funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount
funded by all Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement
obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective
participations.

            (e) Upon the request of any Participant, each Issuing Lender shall
furnish to such Participant copies of any standby Letter of Credit issued by it
and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.

            (f) The obligations of the Participants to make payments to each
Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not
subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

            (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
      of the other Credit Documents;

            (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
      which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against a
      beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of
      Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the
      Administrative Agent, any Participant, or any other Person, whether in
      connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
      contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any
      underlying transaction between Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings and
      the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

            (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under
      any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
      insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
      inaccurate in any respect;

            (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance
      or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

            (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.


                                      -16-
<PAGE>
            2.05 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The Borrower
agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender, by making payment to the Administrative
Agent in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, for any payment or
disbursement made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it
(each such amount, so paid until reimbursed, an "Unpaid Drawing"), not later
than one Business Day following receipt by the Borrower of notice of such
payment or disbursement (provided that no such notice shall be required to be
given if a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 shall have
occurred and be continuing, in which case the Unpaid Drawing shall be due and
payable immediately without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind
(all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower)), with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender, to the extent not reimbursed prior
to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement, from
and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such Issuing
Lender was reimbursed by the Borrower therefor at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin as in effect
from time to time for Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans;
provided, however, to the extent such amounts are not reimbursed prior to 12:00
Noon (New York time) on the third Business Day following the receipt by the
Borrower of notice of such payment or disbursement or following the occurrence
of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05, interest shall
thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender
(and until reimbursed by the Borrower) at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans
that are maintained as Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time plus 2%,
with such interest to be payable on demand. Each Issuing Lender shall give the
Borrower prompt written notice of each Drawing under any Letter of Credit issued
by it, provided that the failure to give any such notice shall in no way affect,
impair or diminish the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

            (b) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.05 to
reimburse each Issuing Lender with respect to drafts, demands and other
presentations for payment under Letters of Credit issued by it (each a
"Drawing") (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment (other than payment of such Obligation in
cash in accordance with the terms hereof) which Holdings or any Subsidiary of
Holdings may have or have had against any Lender (including in its capacity as
an Issuing Lender or as a Participant), including, without limitation, any
defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to
conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any nonapplication or
misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse any Issuing
Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of
Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

            2.06 Increased Costs. If at any time after the Effective Date, the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule, regulation, order,
guideline or request or in the interpretation or administration thereof by the
NAIC or any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or any Participant
with any request or directive by the NAIC or by any such governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), shall either (i) impose, modify or
make applicable any


                                      -17-
<PAGE>
reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against letters of
credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participated in by any Participant, or
(ii) impose on any Issuing Lender or any Participant any other conditions
relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement or any Letter of Credit; and
the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Issuing Lender
or any Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of
Credit, or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Issuing
Lender or any Participant hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital
with respect to Letters of Credit (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or
determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such Issuing Lender
or such Participant pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized or in which its principal office or applicable lending office is
located or any subdivision thereof or therein), then, upon the delivery of the
certificate referred to below to the Borrower by any Issuing Lender or any
Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or
such Participant to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to
such Issuing Lender or such Participant such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant for such increased cost
or reduction in the amount receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its
capital. Any Issuing Lender or any Participant, upon determining that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.06, will give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall include a
certificate submitted to the Borrower by such Issuing Lender or such Participant
(a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Issuing Lender or such
Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for the calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant. The certificate required to
be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

            SECTION 3. Commitment Commission; Fees; Reductions of Commitment.

            3.01 Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for distribution to each Non-Defaulting RL Lender a commitment commission
(the "Commitment Commission") for the period from and including the Effective
Date to and including the Revolving Loan Maturity Date (or such earlier date on
which the Total Revolving Loan Commitment has been terminated) computed at a
rate per annum equal to -1/2 of 1% of the Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment
of such Non-Defaulting RL Lender as in effect from time to time. Accrued
Commitment Commission shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date and on the date upon which the Total Revolving Loan
Commitment is terminated.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to each RL Lender (based on each such RL Lender's respective RL
Percentage) a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the "Letter of Credit
Fee") for the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of such Letter of
Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin as in effect
from time to time during such period with respect to Revolving Loans that are
maintained as Eurodollar Loans on the daily Stated Amount of each such Letter of
Credit. Accrued Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the first day on or after the

            (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own
account, a facing fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it (the
"Facing Fee") for the period from and including the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of such
Letter of Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to 1/4 of 1% on the daily
Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, provided that in any event the minimum
amount of Facing Fees payable in any twelve-month period for each Letter of
Credit shall be not less than $500; it being agreed that, on the day of issuance
of any Letter of Credit and on each anniversary thereof prior to the termination
or expiration of such Letter of Credit, if $500 will exceed the amount of Facing
Fees that will accrue with respect to such Letter of Credit for the immediately
succeeding twelve-month period, the full $500 shall be payable on the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit and on each such anniversary thereof. Except
as otherwise provided in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
accrued Facing Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date and upon the first day on or after the termination of the
Total Revolving Loan Commitment upon which no Letters of Credit remain
outstanding.

            (d) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own
account, upon each payment under, issuance of, or amendment to, any Letter of
Credit issued by it, such amount as shall at the time of such event be the
administrative charge and the reasonable expenses which such Issuing Lender is
generally imposing in connection with such occurrence with respect to letters of
credit.

            (e) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such fees
as may be agreed to in writing from time to time by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries and the Administrative Agent.

            3.02 Voluntary Termination of Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitments.
(a) Upon at least three Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent
shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the
right, at any time or from time to time, without premium or penalty to terminate
the Total Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment in whole, or reduce it in part,
pursuant to this Section 3.02(a), in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in the
case of partial reductions to the Total Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment,
provided that each such reduction shall apply proportionately to permanently
reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each RL Lender.

            (b) In the event of a refusal by a Lender to consent to certain
proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this
Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, subject to its
compliance with the requirements of Section 13.12(b), upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders)
terminate all of the Commitments of such Lender, so long as all Loans, together
with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and all other amounts, owing to such
Lender are repaid concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination
pursuant to Section 4.01(b) (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified
to reflect such changed amounts) and such Lender's RL Percentage of all
outstanding Letters of Credit is cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to
the Administrative


                                      -19-
<PAGE>
Agent and the respective Issuing Lenders, and at such time, such Lender shall no
longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement, except with respect
to indemnifications under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01), which shall survive as to
such repaid Lender.

            3.03 Mandatory Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Total Commitment
(and the Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its entirety on July 31,
2003, unless the Initial Borrowing Date has occurred on or prior to such date.

            (b) In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total Term Loan Commitment (and the Term Loan
Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its entirety on the Initial
Borrowing Date (after giving effect to the incurrence of Term Loans on such
date).

            (c) In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total Revolving Loan Commitment (and the
Revolving Loan Commitment of each RL Lender) shall terminate in its entirety
upon the earlier of (i) the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and (ii) unless the
Required Lenders otherwise agree in writing, the date on which a Change of
Control occurs.

            SECTION 4. Prepayments; Payments; Taxes.

            4.01 Voluntary Prepayments. (a) The Borrower shall have the right to
prepay the Loans, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time on the following terms and conditions: (i) the Borrower
shall give the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at the
Notice Office (x) at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay Base
Rate Loans (or same day notice in the case of a prepayment of Swingline Loans)
and (y) at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay Eurodollar Loans, which
notice (in each case) shall specify whether Term Loans, Revolving Loans or
Swingline Loans shall be prepaid, the amount of such prepayment and the Types of
Loans to be prepaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the specific Borrowing
or Borrowings pursuant to which such Eurodollar Loans were made, and which
notice the Administrative Agent shall, except in the case of a prepayment of
Swingline Loans, promptly transmit to each of the Lenders; (ii) (x) each partial
prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is
acceptable to the Administrative Agent), (y) each partial prepayment of
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable
to the Administrative Agent) and (z) each partial prepayment of Swingline Loans
pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at
least $250,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the Administrative
Agent); (iii) each prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) in respect of any
Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among such Loans,
provided that at the Borrower's election in connection with any prepayment of
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01(a), such prepayment shall not, so
long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, be applied to any Revolving
Loan of a Defaulting Lender; and (iv) each voluntary prepayment of Term Loans
pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) shall be applied to reduce the then


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
remaining Scheduled Repayments on a pro rata basis (based upon the then
remaining unpaid principal amounts of such Scheduled Repayments after giving
effect to all prior reductions thereto).

            (b) In the event of a refusal by a Lender to consent to certain
proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this
Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders)
repay all Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees, and other
amounts owing to such Lender in accordance with, and subject to the requirements
of, said Section 13.12(b) so long as (I) all Commitments of such Lender are
terminated concurrently with such repayment pursuant to Section 3.02(b) (at
which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the changed
Commitments), (II) such Lender's RL Percentage of all outstanding Letters of
Credit is cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and the respective Issuing Lenders and (III) the consents, if any,
required under Section 13.12(b) in connection with the repayment pursuant to
this clause (b) have been obtained. Each prepayment of any Term Loans pursuant
to this Section 4.01(b) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining Scheduled
Repayments of the Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining
unpaid principal amounts of such Scheduled Repayments after giving effect to all
prior reductions thereto).

            4.02 Mandatory Repayments. (a) On any day on which the sum of (I)
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans (after giving
effect to all other repayments thereof on such date), (II) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans (after giving effect to all
other repayments thereof on such date) and (III) the aggregate amount of all
Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Total Revolving Loan Commitment at
such time, the Borrower shall prepay on such day the principal of Swingline
Loans and, after all Swingline Loans have been repaid in full or if no Swingline
Loans are outstanding, Revolving Loans in an amount equal to such excess. If,
after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Swingline Loans and
Revolving Loans, the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Outstandings
exceeds the Total Revolving Loan Commitment at such time, the Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office on such day an amount of cash
and/or Cash Equivalents equal to the amount of such excess (up to a maximum
amount equal to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time), such cash
and/or Cash Equivalents to be held as security for all obligations of the
Borrower to the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral
account to be established by the Administrative Agent.

            (b) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 4.02, on each date set forth below (each, a "Scheduled Repayment Date"),
the Borrower shall be required to repay that principal amount of Term Loans, to
the extent then outstanding, as is set forth opposite each such date below (each
such repayment, as the same may be reduced as provided in Section 4.01(a),
4.01(b) or 4.02(g), a "Scheduled Repayment"):

            (c) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 4.02, on each date on or after the Initial Borrowing Date upon which
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries receives any cash proceeds from any capital
contribution or any sale or issuance of its common or preferred equity
(including from the sale or issuance of options, warrants or rights to purchase
any such equity) (other than proceeds received from (i) equity issued by
Holdings to the extent that such proceeds are used, within 90 days after receipt
thereof, to finance a Permitted Acquisition and to pay the related fees and
expenses (although if all or any portion of such proceeds are not so used within
such 90-day period, such remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of
such period as provided below in this Section 4.02(c)), (ii) the sale or
issuance by Holdings of shares of its common or preferred equity (including as a
result of the exercise of any options, warrants or rights with respect thereto),
or options, warrants or rights to purchase such common or preferred equity, in
either case to any officers, directors or employees of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) any capital contributions made by Holdings to the Borrower
either (x) in connection with an equity issuance or sale described in preceding
clauses (i) and (ii) or (y) with proceeds received by Holdings from a source
other than from the sale or issuance of Holdings' equity or a capital
contribution received by Holdings, and (iv) any capital contribu-

tions made to any Subsidiary of the Borrower to the extent made by the Borrower
or another Subsidiary of the Borrower), an amount equal to 50% of the Net Equity
Proceeds of such capital contribution or sale or issuance of equity shall be
applied on such date as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term
Loans in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(g) and (h); provided,
however, if at the time of such equity issuance or capital contribution no
Default or Event of Default then exists or would result therefrom and the Senior
Leverage Ratio at such time (determined before giving effect to any such
issuance or capital contribution) is less than 1.00:1:00, then no mandatory
repayment shall be required pursuant to this Section 4.02(c).

            (d) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 4.02, on each date on or after the Initial Borrowing Date upon which
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries receives any cash proceeds from any issuance
or incurrence by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries of Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to Section 9.04 as in effect on
the Effective Date), an amount equal to 100% of the Net Debt Proceeds of the
respective issuance or incurrence of Indebtedness shall be applied on such date
as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term Loans in accordance
with the requirements of Sections 4.02(g) and (h); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Net Debt Proceeds of Additional Permitted
Subordinated Debt that are not used within the 60- or 90- day period specified
(and for the purposes described) in Section 9.04(vii)(B) or 9.04(viii), as
applicable, shall be applied on the last day of such period as a mandatory
repayment of principal of outstanding Term Loans in accordance with the
requirements of Sections 4.02(g) and (h).

            (e) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 4.02, on each date on or after the Initial Borrowing Date upon which
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries receives any cash proceeds from any Asset
Sale, an amount equal to 100% of the Net Sale Proceeds therefrom shall be
applied on such date as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term
Loans in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(g) and (h); provided,
however, that with respect to no more than $25,000,000 in the aggregate of cash
proceeds from Asset Sales in any fiscal year of Holdings, the Net Sale Proceeds
therefrom shall not be required to be so applied on such date so long as no
Default or Event of Default then exists or would result from such Asset Sale and
such Net Sale Proceeds shall be used to purchase assets (other than working
capital) used or to be used in the businesses permitted pursuant to Section 9.12
within 360 days following the date of such Asset Sale, and provided further,
that if all or any portion of such Net Sale Proceeds not required to be so
applied as provided above in this Section 4.02(e) are not so reinvested within
such 360-day period (or such earlier date, if any, as Holdings or the relevant
Subsidiary determines not to reinvest the Net Sale Proceeds from such Asset Sale
as set forth above), such remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of
such period (or such earlier date, as the case may be) as provided above in this
Section 4.02(e) without regard to the preceding proviso.

            (f) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 4.02, within 30 days following each date on or after the Initial
Borrowing Date upon which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries receives any cash
proceeds from any Recovery Event (other than Recovery Events where the Net
Insurance Proceeds therefrom do not exceed $500,000), an amount equal to 100% of
the Net Insurance Proceeds from such Recovery Event shall be applied within such
30 day period as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term Loans in


                                      -23-
<PAGE>
accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(g) and (h); provided, however,
that (x) so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and such Net
Insurance Proceeds do not exceed $30,000,000, such Net Insurance Proceeds shall
not be required to be so applied within such 30 day period to the extent that
Holdings has delivered a certificate to the Administrative Agent within such 30
day period stating that such Net Insurance Proceeds shall be used to replace or
restore properties or assets in respect of which such Net Insurance Proceeds
were paid within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net Insurance
Proceeds (which certificate shall set forth the estimates of the Net Insurance
Proceeds to be so expended), and (y) so long as no Default or Event of Default
then exists and if (i) the amount of such Net Insurance Proceeds exceeds
$30,000,000, (ii) the amount of such Net Insurance Proceeds, together with other
cash available to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, equals at least 100% of the
cost of replacement or restoration of the properties or assets in respect of
which such Net Insurance Proceeds were paid as determined by the Borrower and as
supported by such estimates or bids from contractors or subcontractors or such
other supporting information as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request,
and (iii) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have sufficient business
interruption insurance and will receive payments thereunder, as well as will
have sufficient cash flow from operations, in such amounts and at such times as
are necessary to satisfy all obligations and expenses of the Borrower
(including, without limitation, all debt service requirements, including
pursuant to this Agreement), without any delay or extension thereof, for the
period from the date of the respective casualty, condemnation or other event
giving rise to the Recovery Event and continuing through the completion of the
replacement or restoration of respective properties or assets, then the entire
amount of the proceeds of such Recovery Event and not just the portion in excess
of $30,000,000 shall be deposited with the Administrative Agent pursuant to a
cash collateral arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
whereby such proceeds shall be disbursed to the Borrower from time to time as
needed to pay actual costs incurred by it or its applicable Subsidiary in
connection with the replacement or restoration of the respective properties or
assets (pursuant to such certification requirements as may be established by the
Administrative Agent), provided further, that at any time while an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Lenders may direct the
Administrative Agent (in which case the Administrative Agent shall, and is
hereby authorized by the Borrower to, follow said directions) to apply any or
all proceeds then on deposit in such collateral account to the repayment of
Obligations hereunder, and provided further, that if all or any portion of such
proceeds not required to be applied as a mandatory repayment pursuant to the
second preceding proviso (whether pursuant to clause (x) or (y) thereof) are not
so used within 360 days after the date of the receipt of the respective Net
Insurance Proceeds, then such remaining portion not used shall be applied on the
361st day following the receipt of the respective Net Insurance Proceeds (or
such earlier date, if any, as Holdings or the relevant Subsidiary determines not
to reinvest the Net Insurance Proceeds relating to such Recovery Event as set
forth above) as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Terms Loans in
accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(g) and (h).

            (g) The amount of each principal repayment of Term Loans made as
required by Sections 4.02(c), (d), (e) and (f) shall be applied to reduce the
then remaining Scheduled Repayments on a pro rata basis (based upon the then
remaining unpaid principal amounts of such Scheduled Repayments after giving
effect to all prior reductions thereto).


                                      -24-
<PAGE>
            (h) With respect to each repayment of Loans required by this Section
4.02, the Borrower may designate the Types of Loans of the respective Tranche
which are to be repaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the specific
Borrowing or Borrowings of the respective Tranche pursuant to which such
Eurodollar Loans were made, provided that: (i) repayments of Eurodollar Loans
pursuant to this Section 4.02 may only be made on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto unless all Eurodollar Loans of the respective Tranche
with Interest Periods ending on such date of required repayment and all Base
Rate Loans of the respective Tranche have been paid in full; and (ii) each
repayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata
among such Loans. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described
in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above,
make such designation in its sole discretion.

            (i) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 4.02, (i) all then outstanding Term Loans shall be repaid in full on the
Term Loan Maturity Date, (ii) all then outstanding Revolving Loans shall be
repaid in full on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, (iii) all then outstanding
Swingline Loans shall be repaid in full on the Swingline Expiry Date and (iv)
unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree in writing, all then outstanding
Loans shall be repaid in full on the date on which a Change of Control occurs.

            4.03 Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all payments under this Agreement and under any Note shall be
made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender or Lenders
entitled thereto not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date when due
and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Payment
Office. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under any Note shall be
stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to
payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable rate during
such extension.

            4.04 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by any Credit Party under
any Credit Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense
(other than payment of such Obligation in cash in accordance with the terms
hereof). Except as provided in Section 4.04(b), all such payments will be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of
whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments
(but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax
imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in
which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is
located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or
similar liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, fees, assessments or other charges (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to
collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower
and any other Credit Party agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such
additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due
under this Agreement or under any other Credit Document, after withholding or
deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount
provided for herein or in such other Credit Document. If any amounts are payable
in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Borrower and any
other


                                      -25-
<PAGE>
Credit Party jointly and severally agree to reimburse each Lender, upon the
written request of such Lender, for taxes imposed on or measured by the net
income or net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in
which such Lender is organized or in which the principal office or applicable
lending office of such Lender is located or under the laws of any political
subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is
organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such
Lender is located and for any withholding of taxes as such Lender shall
determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender, in respect of such
amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding
sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender
pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent
within 45 days after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to
applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the
Borrower or the respective Credit Party. The Borrower and any other Credit Party
jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and
reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so
levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

            (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the Effective Date or, in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee
of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04(b) (unless
the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such
assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such
Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under
an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States
withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and
under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under
an income tax treaty) (or any successor forms) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x)
a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D (any such certificate, a
"Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with respect to the
portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States
withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this
Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to
time after the Effective Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances
renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material
respect, such Lender will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax
treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a
Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may
be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with
respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or such Lender shall
immediately notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to
deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be
required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section
4.04(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.04(a),
but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the immediately


                                      -26-

succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is
required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed
by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof
or therein) from interest, Fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the
account of any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or
withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section
4.04(a) to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income or
similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided
to the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) or (II) in the case of a payment,
other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent
that such forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such
taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding
sentence or elsewhere in this Section 4.04 and except as set forth in Section
13.04(b), the Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify
each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 4.04(a) (without regard to the
identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect
of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately
preceding sentence as a result of any changes after the Effective Date in any
applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in
the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of income
or similar taxes.

of each such Credit Event (except as hereinafter indicated), to the satisfaction
of the following conditions:

         6.01 No Default; Representations and Warranties. At the time of each
such Credit Event and also after giving effect thereto (i) there shall exist no
Default or Event of Default and (ii) all representations and warranties

effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on the date
of such Credit Event (it being understood and agreed that any representation or
warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified date shall be required to
be true and correct in all material respects only as of such specified date).

         6.02 Notice of Borrowing; Letter of Credit Request. (a) Prior to the
making of each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan or a Revolving Loan made
pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing), the Administrative Agent shall have received

Holdings, the Borrower and/or any other Subsidiary of Holdings on the respective
date of incurrence of the respective Credit Event for a permitted purpose other
than an investment in Cash Equivalents)) in excess of $350,000,000.

         The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event shall constitute a
representation and warranty by Holdings and the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent and each of the Lenders that all the conditions specified in Section 5
(with respect to Credit Events on the Initial Borrowing Date) and in this
Section 6 (with respect to Credit Events on or after the Initial Borrowing Date)
and applicable to such Credit Event are satisfied as of that time. All of the

         SECTION 7. Representations, Warranties and Agreements. In order to
induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, and issue
(or participate in) the Letters of Credit as provided herein, each of Holdings
and the Borrower makes the following representations, warranties and agreements,
in each case after giving effect to the Transaction, all of which shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making of the
Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, with the occurrence of each
Credit Event on or after the Initial Borrowing Date being deemed to constitute a
representation and warranty that the matters specified in this Section 7 are
true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Initial Borrowing
Date and on the date of each such other Credit Event (it being


                                      -31-
<PAGE>
understood and agreed that any representation or warranty which by its terms is
made as of a specified date shall be required to be true and correct in all
material respects only as of such specified date).

         7.01 Organizational Status. Each of Holdings and each of its
Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization except, in the case of a
Foreign Subsidiary of the Borrower, for failures to be in good standing which,
either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) has the corporate, partnership or limited
liability company power and authority, as the case may be, to own its property
and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and presently
proposes to engage and (iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualifications except for failures to be so qualified which, either individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         7.02 Power and Authority. Each Credit Party has the corporate,
partnership or limited liability company power and authority, as the case may
be, to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each of the
Credit Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary corporate,
partnership or limited liability company action, as the case may be, to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such Credit
Documents. Each Credit Party has duly executed and delivered each of the Credit
Documents to which it is party, and each of such Credit Documents constitutes
its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).

         7.03 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by
any Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, nor compliance
by it with the terms and provisions thereof, (i) will contravene any provision
of any law, statute, rule or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree
of any court or governmental instrumentality, (ii) will conflict with or result
in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the
obligation to create or impose) any Lien (except pursuant to the Security
Documents) upon any of the property or assets of any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
credit agreement or loan agreement, or any other material agreement, contract or
instrument, in each case to which any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or by which it or any its property or assets is bound or to which it may
be subject, or (iii) will violate any provision of the certificate or articles
of incorporation, certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement
or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents), as applicable, of any
Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

         7.04 Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization or
validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by
(except for (x) those that have otherwise been obtained or made on or prior to
the Initial Borrowing Date and which


                                      -32-
<PAGE>
remain in full force and effect on the Initial Borrowing Date and (y) such
filings (if any) as may be required to perfect the Liens created pursuant to the
applicable Security Documents (which filings have been made to the extent that
this representation and warranty is made (or deemed made) on or after the 10th
day after the execution and delivery of such Security Documents)), any
governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is
required to be obtained or made by, or on behalf of, any Credit Party to
authorize, or is required to be obtained or made by, or on behalf of, any Credit
Party in connection with, (i) the execution, delivery and performance of any
Credit Document or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability
of any such Credit Document.

         7.05 Financial Statements; Financial Condition; Undisclosed
Liabilities; Projections. (a) (i) The consolidated balance sheets of Holdings
for its fiscal year and three-month period ended December 29, 2002 and March 30,
2003, respectively, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash
flows and retained earnings of Holdings for its fiscal year and three-month
period, as the case may be, ended on such dates, copies of which have been
furnished to the Lenders prior to the Initial Borrowing Date, present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Holdings at the
dates of such balance sheets and the consolidated results of the operations of
Holdings for the periods covered thereby. All of the foregoing historical
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied (except, in the case of the
aforementioned three-month interim financial statements, for normal year-end
audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes).

         (ii) The pro forma consolidated balance sheet of Holdings as of March
30, 2003, a copy of which has been furnished to the Lenders prior to the Initial
Borrowing Date, presents fairly in all material respects the pro forma
consolidated financial position of Holdings as of March 30, 2003 after giving
effect to the Transaction as if same had occurred on such date.

         (b) On and as of the Initial Borrowing Date and after giving effect to
the Transaction and to all Indebtedness (including, without duplication, the
Loans) being incurred or assumed and Liens created by the Credit Parties in
connection therewith, (i) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of the
Borrower on a stand-alone basis and of Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole will exceed their respective debts, (ii) each of the Borrower on a
stand-alone basis and Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole have not
incurred and do not intend to incur, and do not believe that they will incur,
debts beyond their respective ability to pay such debts as such debts mature,
and (iii) the Borrower on a stand-alone basis and Holdings and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole will have sufficient capital with which to conduct their
respective businesses. For purposes of this Section 7.05(b), "debt" means any
liability on a claim, and "claim" means (a) right to payment, whether or not
such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured,
or unsecured or (b) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if
such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured or unsecured. The amount of contingent liabilities at any
time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an actual or matured liability.



                                      -33-
<PAGE>
         (c) Except as disclosed in the financial statements delivered pursuant
to Section 7.05(a) and except for the Obligations, there were as of the Initial
Borrowing Date no liabilities or obligations with respect to Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As of the Initial Borrowing Date, neither
Holdings nor the Borrower knows of any basis for the assertion against it or any
of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever that
is not disclosed in the financial statements delivered pursuant to Section
7.05(a) or referred to in the immediately preceding sentence which, either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to
Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as whole.

         (d) The Projections delivered to the Agents and the Lenders prior to
the Initial Borrowing Date have been prepared in good faith and are based on
assumptions believed by Holdings and the Borrower to be reasonable at the time
made (which assumptions remain reasonable on the Initial Borrowing Date), it
being recognized by the Lenders, however, that projections as to future events
are not to be viewed as facts and that the actual results during the period or
periods covered by the Projections may differ from the projected results and
such differences may be material.

         (e) Since December 29, 2002, there has been no change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), business, operations, property, assets, liabilities or
prospects of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

         7.06 Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or,
to the knowledge of Holdings and the Borrower, threatened (i) with respect to
any Credit Document or (ii) that could reasonably be expected, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.07 True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information (taken as a
whole) furnished by or on behalf of Holdings or the Borrower in writing to any
Agent or any Lender (including, without limitation, all information contained in
the Credit Documents) for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, the
other Credit Documents or any transaction contemplated herein or therein is, and
all other such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or
on behalf of Holdings or the Borrower in writing to any Agent or any Lender will
be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and not incomplete by omitting to state any
fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not misleading in any
material respect at such time in light of the circumstances under which such
information was provided.

         7.08 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. (a) All proceeds of the Term
Loans will be used by the Borrower to finance, in part, the Refinancing and to
pay the fees and expenses relating to the Transaction.

         (b) All proceeds of the Revolving Loans and the Swingline Loans will be
used for the working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries;


                                      -34-
<PAGE>
provided that no Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans may be used to effect the
Refinancing or to pay any fees and expenses related to the Transaction.

         (c) No part of any Credit Event (or the proceeds thereof) will be used
to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. Neither the making of any Loan nor the
use of the proceeds thereof nor the occurrence of any other Credit Event will
violate or be inconsistent with the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

         7.09 Tax Returns and Payments. Each of Holdings and each of its
Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the appropriate
taxing authority all federal, state and other material returns, statements,
forms and reports for taxes (the "Returns") required to be filed by, or with
respect to the income, properties or operations of, Holdings and/or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Returns accurately reflect in all material respects all
liability for taxes of Holdings and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby. Each of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries has paid all taxes and
assessments payable by it which have become due, other than those that are
immaterial and those being contested in good faith and adequately disclosed and
fully provided for on the financial statements of Holdings and its Subsidiaries
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There is no action,
suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now pending or, to the best
knowledge of Holdings and the Borrower, threatened by any authority regarding
any taxes relating to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that, either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the Initial Borrowing Date, neither Holdings nor
any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement or waiver or been
requested to enter into an agreement or waiver extending any statute of
limitations relating to the payment or collection of taxes of Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries, or is aware of any circumstances that would cause the taxable
years or other taxable periods of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries not to be
subject to the normally applicable statute of limitations. Neither Holdings nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, nor will any of them incur, any material
tax liability in connection with the Transaction or any other transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood that the representation contained in
this sentence does not cover any future tax liabilities of Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries arising as a result of the operation of their businesses in the
ordinary course of business).

         7.10 Compliance with ERISA. (a) Schedule V sets forth, as of the
Initial Borrowing Date, the name of each Plan. Each Plan (and each related
trust, insurance contract or fund) is in substantial compliance with its terms
and with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code;
each Plan (and each related trust, if any) which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it meets the requirements of
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code; neither Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained or contributed to, or had
any obligation to maintain or contribute to (or borne any liability with respect
to) any "employee pension benefit plan," within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA, that is a "multiemployer plan," within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA, or that is subject to the minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA or subject to Title IV of ERISA; all contributions
required to be made with respect to a Plan have been timely made; neither
Holdings nor any Subsidiary of Holdings nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
material liability (including any indirect, contingent or secondary liability)
to or on


                                      -35-
<PAGE>
account of a Plan pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4204 or 4212 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or expects to incur any such material
liability under any of the foregoing sections with respect to any Plan; no
condition exists which presents a material risk to Holdings or any Subsidiary of
Holdings or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a material liability to or on
account of a Plan pursuant to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code; no
action, suit, proceeding, hearing, audit or investigation with respect to the
administration, operation or the investment of assets of any Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) is pending, expected or threatened; each group
health plan (as defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA or Section 4980B(g)(2) of the
Code) maintained by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
which covers or has covered employees or former employees of Holdings, any
Subsidiary of Holdings, or any ERISA Affiliate has at all times been operated in
compliance with the provisions of Part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code, except for any failure to so comply which could not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability of Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings; no lien imposed
under the Code or ERISA on the assets of Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings
or any ERISA Affiliate exists or is likely to arise on account of any Plan; and
Holdings and its Subsidiaries may cease contributions to or terminate any equity
based compensation plan and any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of them without incurring any material
liability.

         (b) Each Foreign Pension Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where
required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. All material
contributions required to be made with respect to a Foreign Pension Plan have
been timely made. Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
material obligation in connection with the termination of, or withdrawal from,
any Foreign Pension Plan. The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities
(whether or not vested) under each Foreign Pension Plan, determined as of the
end of Holding's most recently ended fiscal year on the basis of actuarial
assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of
the assets of such Foreign Pension Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities by
a material amount.

         7.11 The Security Documents. (a) The security interests created under
the Pledge Agreement in favor of the Collateral Agent, as Pledgee, for the
benefit of the Secured Creditors, constitute perfected security interests in the
Pledge Agreement Collateral described in the Pledge Agreement (to the extent
that perfection is governed by the law of the United States, any State thereof
or the District of Columbia), subject to no security interests of any other
Person.

         (b) If the Security Agreement is executed and delivered in accordance
with Section 8.12, the provisions of the Security Agreement will be effective to
create in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors
a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in all right, title and
interest of the Credit Parties in the Security Agreement Collateral described
therein (to the extent that such matters are governed by the laws of the United
States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia), and, upon the filing of
appropriate financings under the UCC as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction,
the filing of the Grants of Security Interest in the respective forms attached
to the Security Agreement or the Collateral Agent obtaining


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
possession or control (within the meaning of Section 9-314 of the New York UCC)
to the extent required by the Security Agreement, the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Creditors, will have a fully perfected security interest
in all right, title and interest in all of the Security Agreement Collateral
described therein to the extent that the Security Agreement Collateral consists
of the type of property in which a security interest may be perfected by
possession or control, by filing a financing statement under the UCC as enacted
in any relevant jurisdiction and by a filing of a Grant of Security Interest in
the respective form attached to the Security Agreement in the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or in the United States Copyright Office, subject to
no other Liens other than Permitted Liens. The recordation of (x) the Grant of
Security Interest in U.S. Patents, if applicable, and (y) the Grant of Security
Interest in U.S. Trademarks, if applicable, in the respective form attached to
the Security Agreement, in each case in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, together with filings on Form UCC-1 made pursuant to the Security
Agreement, will create, as may be perfected by such filings and recordation, a
perfected security interest in the United States trademarks and patents covered
by the Security Agreement, and the recordation of the Grant of Security Interest
in U.S. Copyrights, if applicable, in the form attached to the Security
Agreement with the United States Copyright Office, together with filings on Form
UCC-1 made pursuant to the Security Agreement, will create, as may be perfected
by such filings and recordation, a perfected security interest in the United
States copyrights covered by the Security Agreement.

         (c) If any Mortgage is executed and delivered in accordance with
Section 8.12, each such Mortgage will create, as security for the obligations
purported to be secured thereby, a valid and enforceable perfected security
interest in and mortgage lien on the respective Mortgaged Property in favor of
the Collateral Agent (or such other trustee as may be required or desired under
local law) for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, superior and prior to the
rights of all third Persons (except that the security interest and mortgage lien
created on such Mortgaged Property may be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances
related thereto) and subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens
related thereto).

         7.12 Properties. All Real Property owned by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Initial Borrowing Date, and the nature of the interest
therein, is correctly set forth in Schedule VI. Each of Holdings and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and indefeasible title to all material properties owned by
it, including all material property reflected in the most recent historical
balance sheets referred to in Section 7.05(a) (except as sold or otherwise
disposed of since the date of such balance sheet in the ordinary course of
business or as permitted by the terms of this Agreement), free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

its capital stock other than (i) the 5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes,
(ii) any Additional Permitted Subordinated Debt that


                                      -37-

from time to time to purchase shares of Holdings' common stock or Qualified

domestic or foreign, in respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership

appoint DBTCA as Administrative Agent (for purposes of this Section 12 and
Section 13.01, the term

                                      -93-
<PAGE>
"Administrative Agent" also shall include DBTCA in its capacity as Collateral
Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as specified herein and in the
other Credit Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each
holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to
authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any other
instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such
powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Administrative Agent may perform any of its respective duties hereunder by or
through its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

            12.02 Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement
and in the other Credit Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any other Credit
Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of the
Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the
Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder
of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon
the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

            12.03 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the holder
of each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to
make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of Holdings and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making and the
continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in
connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries and, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder
of any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether
coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or
times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information,
representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other
writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the financial
condition of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or be required to make any
inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the
financial condition of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or the existence or
possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.

            12.04 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent requests instructions from the Required Lenders with
respect to any act or action (including

                                      -94-
<PAGE>
failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking
such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received
instructions from the Required Lenders; and the Administrative Agent shall not
incur liability to any Lender by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the
foregoing, neither any Lender nor the holder of any Note shall have any right of
action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the
Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any
other Credit Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required
Lenders.

            12.05 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution,
notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message,
cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent
or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper
Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and
any other Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice
of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent.

            12.06 Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent (or
any affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the
Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any affiliate
thereof) in proportion to their respective "percentage" as used in determining
the Required Lenders (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders) for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind
or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent (or any affiliate thereof) in performing its duties
hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's (or such affiliate's)
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

            12.07 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. With
respect to its obligation to make Loans, or issue or participate in Letters of
Credit, under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and
powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same rights and
powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the
term "Lender," "Required Lenders," "Supermajority Lenders," "holders of Notes"
or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,
include the Administrative Agent in its respective individual capacities. The
Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of banking, investment banking, trust or other
business with, or provide debt financing, equity capital or other services
(including financial advisory services) to any Credit Party or any Affiliate of
any Credit Party (or any Person engaged in a similar business with any Credit
Party or any Affiliate thereof) as if they were not performing the duties
specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Credit
Party or any Affiliate of any Credit Party for services in connection with this
Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

                                      -95-
<PAGE>
            12.08 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a
written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case
may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the
case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

            12.09 Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The
Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its respective
functions and duties hereunder and/or under the other Credit Documents at any
time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Lenders and, unless
a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 then exists, the Borrower.
Any such resignation by an Administrative Agent hereunder shall also constitute
its resignation as an Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, in which case the
resigning Administrative Agent (x) shall not be required to issue any further
Letters of Credit or make any additional Swingline Loans hereunder and (y) shall
maintain all of its rights as Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as the case
may be, with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it, or Swingline Loans
made by it, prior to the date of such resignation. Such resignation shall take
effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to
clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.

            (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by the Administrative Agent,
the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or
thereunder who shall be a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Borrower, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(provided that the Borrower's approval shall not be required if an Event of
Default then exists).

            (c) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so
appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the
consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be required if an Event
of Default then exists), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if
any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided above.

            (d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant
to clause (b) or (c) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice
of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's
resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall thereafter
perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any
other Credit Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

            (e) Upon a resignation of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 12.09, the Administrative Agent shall remain indemnified to the extent
provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the provisions of
this Section 12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the Administrative
Agent for all of its actions and inactions while serving as the Administrative
Agent.

                                      -96-
<PAGE>
            SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.

            13.01 Payment of Expenses, etc. The Borrower hereby agrees to: (i)
whether or not the transactions herein contemplated are consummated, pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agents and their respective
affiliates (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of White & Case LLP and the Agents' other counsel and consultants) in connection
with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to herein and
therein (although for the period ending on the Initial Borrowing Date, (x) the
only legal fees and expenses of the Agents that will be reimbursed will be those
of White & Case LLP and (y) no consultant expenses (if any) of the Agents will
be reimbursed) and any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto or thereto,
of the Agents in connection with theirs syndication efforts with respect to this
Agreement and of the Agents and, after the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each of the Issuing Lenders and Lenders in connection with the enforcement of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments
referred to herein and therein or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings
(including, in each case without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and consultants for each of the Agents and, after the
occurrence of an Event of Default, counsel for each of the Issuing Lenders and
Lenders); (ii) pay and hold each Agent, each of the Issuing Lenders and each of
the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp,
excise and other similar documentary taxes with respect to the foregoing matters
and save each Agent, each of the Issuing Lenders and each of the Lenders
harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting
from any delay or omission (other than to the extent attributable to such Agent,
such Issuing Lender or such Lender) to pay such taxes; and (iii) indemnify each
Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Lender, and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, affiliates, trustees
and investment advisors from and hold each of them harmless against any and all
liabilities, obligations (including removal or remedial actions), losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and
disbursements (including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and
disbursements) incurred by, imposed on or assessed against any of them as a
result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, (a) any
investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not any Agent, any
Issuing Lender or any Lender is a party thereto and whether or not such
investigation, litigation or other proceeding is brought by or on behalf of any
Credit Party) related to the entering into and/or performance of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document or the use of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds
of any Loans hereunder or the consummation of the Transaction or any other
transactions contemplated herein or in any other Credit Document or the exercise
of any of their rights or remedies provided herein or in the other Credit
Documents, or (b) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials in the
air, surface water or groundwater or on the surface or subsurface of any Real
Property at any time owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, the generation, storage, transportation, handling or disposal of
Hazardous Materials by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries at any location,
whether or not owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries,
the non-compliance by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries with any Environmental
Law (including applicable permits thereunder) applicable to any Real Property,
or any Environmental Claim asserted against Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Real Property at any time owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries,

                                      -97-
<PAGE>
including, in each case, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and other consultants incurred in connection with any
such investigation, litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision)). To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold
harmless any Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender set forth in the preceding
sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public
policy, the Borrower shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and
satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities which is permissible under
applicable law.

            13.02 Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any
such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Lender is hereby
authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind to any Credit Party or to any other Person,
any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and
apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other Indebtedness at
any time held or owing by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such
Lender (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender wherever located) to or
for the credit or the account of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries against and
on account of the Obligations and liabilities of the Credit Parties to the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender under this Agreement or
under any of the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all
interests in Obligations purchased by such Lender pursuant to Section 13.06(b),
and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected
with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not
the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender shall have made any
demand hereunder and although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of
them, shall be contingent or unmatured.

            13.03 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including telegraphic, telex, telecopier or cable communication) and mailed,
telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered: if to any Credit Party,
at the address specified opposite its signature below or in the other relevant
Credit Documents; if to any Lender, at its address specified on Schedule III;
and if to the Administrative Agent, at the Notice Office; or, as to any Credit
Party or the Administrative Agent, at such other address as shall be designated
by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto and, as to each
Lender, at such other address as shall be designated by such Lender in a written
notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and
communications shall, when mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, or cabled
or sent by overnight courier, be effective when deposited in the mails,
delivered to the telegraph company, cable company or overnight courier, as the
case may be, or sent by telex or telecopier, except that notices and
communications to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall not be
effective until received by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the
case may be.

            13.04 Benefit of Agreement; Assignments; Participations. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided,
however, neither Holdings nor the Borrower may

                                      -98-
<PAGE>
assign or transfer any of its rights, obligations or interest hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Lenders and, provided further, that, although
any Lender may transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder,
such Lender shall remain a "Lender" for all purposes hereunder (and may not
transfer or assign all or any portion of its Commitments hereunder except as
provided in Sections 1.13 and 13.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or
participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a "Lender" hereunder and,
provided further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under
which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of
this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such amendment
or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note or
Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended beyond the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date) in which such participant is participating, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon
(except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default
increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being
understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in
this Agreement or to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the
rate of interest or Fees payable hereunder), or increase the amount of the
participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory
reduction in the Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of
such participation, and that an increase in any Commitment (or the available
portion thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any
participant if the participant's participation is not increased as a result
thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by Holdings or the Borrower
of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all
or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents
(except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) supporting the Loans or
Letters of Credit hereunder in which such participant is participating. In the
case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant's rights
against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in
the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating
thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined
as if such Lender had not sold such participation.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender
together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its
Commitments and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Commitments with
respect to the relevant Tranche have terminated, outstanding Obligations)
hereunder to (i)(A) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which
is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company or (B) to one or more
other Lenders or any affiliate of any such other Lender which is at least 50%
owned by such other Lender or its parent company (provided that any fund that
invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of
another fund which is a Lender (or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor)
shall be treated as an affiliate of such other Lender for the purposes of this
sub-clause (x)(i)(B)), or (ii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund that
invests in loans, any other fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised
by the same investment advisor of any Lender or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at
least (I) $1,000,000 in the case of outstanding Term Loans and (II) $5,000,000
in the case of Revolving Loan Commitments, in each case in the aggregate for the
assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of such Commitments and related
outstanding Obligations (or, if the Commitments with respect to the relevant
Tranche have terminated, outstanding Obligations) hereunder to one or more
Eligible Transferees (treating any fund that

                                      -99-
<PAGE>
invests in loans and any other fund that invests in loans and is managed or
advised by the same investment advisor of such fund or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor as a single Eligible Transferee), each of which assignees
shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement, provided that (i) at such time, Schedule I shall be
deemed modified to reflect the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case
may be, of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders, (ii) upon the surrender
of the relevant Notes by the assigning Lender (or, upon such assigning Lender's
indemnifying the Borrower for any lost Note pursuant to a customary
indemnification agreement) new Notes will be issued, at the Borrower's expense,
to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender upon the request of such new
Lender or assigning Lender, such new Notes to be in conformity with the
requirements of Section 1.05 (with appropriate modifications) to the extent
needed to reflect the revised Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case
may be, (iii) the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default
under Section 10.01 or 10.05 or any Event of Default then exists, the consent of
the Borrower in each case shall be required in connection with any such
assignment pursuant to clause (y) above (each of which consents shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided, however, that for the first 30 days
following the Initial Borrowing Date, assignments by DBTCA shall not require the
consent of the Borrower), (iv) the Administrative Agent shall receive at the
time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment
of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 and (v) no such transfer or
assignment will be effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on the
Register pursuant to Section 13.15. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to
this Section 13.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments and outstanding Loans. At the
time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b) to a Person which is
not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such
term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax
purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall, to the extent legally entitled
to do so, provide to the Borrower the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms
(and, if applicable, a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section
4.04(b). To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's
Commitments and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 1.13 or this
Section 13.04(b) would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased
costs under Section 1.10, 2.06 or 4.04 from those being charged by the
respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrower shall
not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the Borrower, in
accordance with and pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be
obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting
from changes after the date of the respective assignment).

            (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender
from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support
of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, with prior
notification to the Administrative Agent (but without the consent of the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower), any Lender which is a fund may pledge all
or any portion of its Loans and Notes to its trustee or to a collateral agent
providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations
to such trustee, such collateral agent or a holder of such obligations, as the
case may be. No pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.

                                     -100-
<PAGE>
      13.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any other Credit Party
and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any
Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights, powers and
remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to
any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

      13.06 Payments Pro Rata. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of
each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders
entitled thereto (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive
its pro rata share of any such payment) pro rata based upon their respective
shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was
received.

      (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise), which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans, Unpaid Drawings, Commitment Commission or Letter of Credit Fees,
of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Lenders
is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due
to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed and due to all of
the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such
excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the
other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the respective Credit Party to
such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by
all the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such
excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lenders, such purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest.

      (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions of the preceding Sections 13.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the
express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing
payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.

      13.07 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements to be
furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the
notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing by Holdings to the


                                     -101-
<PAGE>
Lenders); provided that, (i) except as otherwise specifically provided herein
(including with respect to certain adjustments to the financial definitions
provided for herein), all computations of the Applicable Margin, and all
computations and all definitions (including accounting terms) used in
determining compliance with Sections 8.16 and 9.07 through 9.09, inclusive,
shall utilize generally accepted accounting principles and policies in
conformity with those used to prepare the audited historical financial
statements of Holdings referred to in Section 7.05(a) and (ii) to the extent
expressly provided herein, certain calculations shall be made on a Pro Forma
Basis.

      (a) All computations of interest, Commitment Commission and other Fees
hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number
of days (including the first day but excluding the last day; except that in the
case of Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees, the last day shall be included)
occurring in the period for which such interest, Commitment Commission or Fees
are payable.

      13.08 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY

Lender (other than a Defaulting


                                     -103-
<PAGE>
Lender) (with Obligations being directly affected in the case of following

extend the stated expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving
Loan Maturity Date, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
or Fees thereon (except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any
post-default increase in interest rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof
(it being understood that any amendment or modification to the financial
definitions in this Agreement or to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a
reduction in the rate of interest or Fees for the purposes of this clause (i)),
or amend Section 1.09 to permit the Borrower to select Interest Periods for any
Tranche of Loans in excess of six months at any time when such longer Interest
Periods are not available to all Lenders of the applicable Tranche, (ii) after

this Agreement; provided further, that no such change, waiver, discharge or
termination shall (1) increase the Commitments of any Lender over the amount
thereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood
that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or
Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not
constitute an increase of the Commitment of any Lender, and that an increase in
the available portion of any Commitment of any Lender shall not constitute an
increase of the Commitment of such Lender), (2) without the consent of each
Issuing Lender, amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2 or alter its
rights or obligations with respect to Letters of Credit, (3) without the consent
of the Swingline Lender, alter the Swingline Lender's rights or obligations with
respect to Swingline Loans, (4) without the consent of the Administrative Agent,

      (b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination of any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by
clauses (i) through (vi), inclusive, of the first proviso to Section 13.12(a),
the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more
of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then the
Borrower shall have the right, so long as all non-consenting Lenders whose
individual consent is required are treated as described in either clauses (A) or
(B) below, to either (A) replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with
one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 so long as at the time
of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed
change, waiver, discharge or termination or (B) terminate such non-consenting
Lender's Commitments and/or repay each Tranche of outstanding Loans of such


                                     -104-
<PAGE>
Lender in accordance with Sections 3.02(b) and/or 4.01(b), provided that, unless
the Commitments that are terminated, and Loans repaid, pursuant to preceding
clause (B) are immediately replaced in full at such time through the addition of
new Lenders or the increase of the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of
existing Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto), then in
the case of any action pursuant to preceding clause (B) the Required Lenders
(determined after giving effect to the proposed action) shall specifically
consent thereto, provided further, that in any event the Borrower shall not have
the right to replace a Lender, terminate its Commitments or repay its Loans
solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's rights (and the withholding
of any required consent by such Lender) pursuant to the second proviso to
Section 13.12(a).

      13.13 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including, without
limitation, in Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01 shall survive
the execution, delivery and termination of this Agreement and the Notes and the
making and repayment of the Obligations.

      13.14 Domicile of Loans. Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at,
to or for the account of any office, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that a
transfer of Loans pursuant to this Section 13.14 would, at the time of such
transfer, result in increased costs under Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.06 or 4.04 from
those being charged by the respective Lender prior to such transfer, then the
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type
described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective
transfer).

      13.15 Register. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to
serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.15, to maintain a
register (the "Register") on which it will record the Commitments from time to
time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each
repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.
Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall
not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to
any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the
principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall
not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by
the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and Loans
and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect
to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The
registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and
Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon
the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered
Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 13.04(b). Coincident
with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the
Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer
of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or
transferor Lender shall surrender the Note (if any) evidencing such Loan, and
thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be
issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender at the
request of any such Lender. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative
Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of
whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 13.15 (except
to the extent


                                     -105-
<PAGE>
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent
(as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable judgment)).

      13.16 Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of this
Section 13.16, each Lender agrees that it will use its reasonable efforts not to
disclose without the prior consent of Holdings (other than to its employees,
auditors, creditors, advisors or counsel or to another Lender if such Lender or
such Lender's holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that
any such party should have access to such information, provided such Persons
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 13.16 to the same extent as
such Lender) any information with respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
which is now or in the future furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Credit Document, provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (i)
as has become generally available to the public other than by virtue of a breach
of this Section 13.16(a) by the respective Lender, (ii) as may be required or
appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal,
state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over
such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere)
or their successors, (iii) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any
summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation, (iv) to the extent
necessary to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such
Lender, (v) to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, (vi) to any
direct or indirect contractual counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar
agreement (or to any such contractual counterparty's professional advisor), so
long as such contractual counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees to
be bound by the provisions of this Section 13.16, and (vii) to any prospective
or actual transferee or participant in connection with any contemplated transfer
or participation of any of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by
such Lender, provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the
confidentiality provisions contained in this Section 13.16.

      (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that
each Agent and Lender may, in connection with such Agent's or Lender's
participation in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, share with any
of its affiliates, and such affiliates may share with such Lender, any
information related to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, any non-public customer information regarding the creditworthiness
of Holdings and its Subsidiaries), provided such Persons shall be subject to the
provisions of this Section 13.16 to the same extent as such Lender.

      (c) Neither any Agent, any Lender, any of their respective affiliates nor
any Credit Party provide accounting, tax or legal advice. Notwithstanding
anything provided herein, and any express or implied claims of exclusivity or
proprietary rights, each party hereto hereby agrees and acknowledges that each
such party (and each of their employees, representatives or other agents) are
authorized to disclose to any and all Persons, beginning immediately upon
commencement of their discussions and without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure of the Transaction, and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided by any such party
to any other party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, except to
the extent that such disclosure is subject to restrictions reasonably necessary
to comply with securities laws. In this regard, each party hereto acknowledges
and agrees that disclosure of the tax treatment and tax structure of the
Transaction has not been and is not limited in any manner by an express or
implied understanding or agreement (whether oral or


                                     -106-
<PAGE>
written, and whether or not such understanding or agreement is legally binding),
except to the extent that such disclosure is subject to restrictions reasonably
necessary to comply with securities laws. For purposes of this authorization,
"tax treatment" means the purported or claimed U.S. federal income tax treatment
of the Transaction, and "tax structure" means any fact that may be relevant to
understanding the purported or claimed U.S. federal income tax treatment of the
Transaction. This paragraph is intended to reflect the understanding of the
parties hereto that the Transaction has not been offered under "conditions of
confidentiality" as that phrase is used in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.6011-4(b)(3(i) and 301.6111-2(c)(i), and shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent therewith. Each party hereto confirms that it has not made or
provided to, nor for the benefit of, any other party hereto any oral or written
statement as to any potential U.S. federal tax consequences that are related to,
or may result from, the Transaction.

      13.17 Power of Attorney. Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably
appoint the Administrative Agent as the attorney-in-fact for Holdings or the
Borrower, with full authority to take actions under this Agreement in the place
and stead of either Holdings or the Borrower after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default. As attorney-in-fact for Holdings and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent may exercise its discretion to take any
action or to execute any instrument (including, without limitation, the Security
Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and any Mortgage) which the Administrative Agent
may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.

      SECTION 14. Holdings Guaranty.

      14.01 Guaranty. In order to induce the Agents, the Collateral Agent, the
Issuing Lenders and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend
credit hereunder, and to induce the other Guaranteed Creditors to enter into
Designated Interest Rate Protection Agreements and Designated Other Hedging
Agreements and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by Holdings
from the proceeds of the Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit and the
entering into of such Designated Interest Rate Protection Agreements and
Designated Other Hedging Agreements, Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed
Creditors as follows: Holdings hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when
due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of the
Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors. If any or
all of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors
becomes due and payable hereunder, Holdings, unconditionally and irrevocably,
promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent and/or the other
Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, together with any and all expenses
which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed
Creditors in collecting any of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty is a
guaranty of payment and not of collection. This Guaranty is a continuing one and
all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be
conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. If claim is ever
made upon any Guaranteed Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or
amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
and any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of
(i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having
jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or
compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any such claimant
(including the Borrower), then and in such event Holdings agrees that any such
judgment, decree, order, settle-


                                     -107-
<PAGE>
ment or compromise shall be binding upon Holdings, notwithstanding any
revocation of this Guaranty or other instrument evidencing any liability of the
Borrower, and Holdings shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees
hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such
amount had never originally been received by any such payee.

      14.02 Bankruptcy. Additionally, Holdings unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the payment of any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations of the
Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors whether or not due or payable by the
Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 10.05,
and irrevocably and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the
Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States.

      14.03 Nature of Liability. The liability of Holdings hereunder is primary,
absolute and unconditional, exclusive and independent of any security for or
other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower, whether executed
by any other guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of Holdings
hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to
application of payment by the Borrower or by any other party, or (b) any other
continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or
of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower, or (c) any
payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking (other than
payment in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations), or (d) any dissolution,
termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e)
any payment made to any Guaranteed Creditor on the Guaranteed Obligations which
any such Guaranteed Creditor repays to the Borrower pursuant to court order in
any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief
proceeding, and Holdings waives any right to the deferral or modification of its
obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, or (f) any action or
inaction by the Guaranteed Creditors as contemplated in Section 14.05, or (g)
any invalidity, irregularity or enforceability of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor.

      14.04 Independent Obligation. The obligations of Holdings hereunder are
independent of the obligations of any other guarantor, any other party or the
Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against
Holdings whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor, any other
party or the Borrower and whether or not any other guarantor, any other party or
the Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. Holdings waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations
affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by the
Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations
as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to
Holdings.

      14.05 Authorization. Holdings authorizes the Guaranteed Creditors without
notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot
be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from
time to time to:

      (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or
extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the
Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the principal
amount thereof or the rate of interest or fees thereon), any security therefor,
or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof,


                                     -108-
<PAGE>
and the Guaranty herein made shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so
changed, extended, renewed or altered;

      (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations
and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal
with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time
pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed
Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred
directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset
thereagainst;

      (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Borrower,
any other Credit Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;

      (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the
Borrower, other Credit Parties or other obligors;

      (e) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security
therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly
or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of
all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of
the Borrower to its creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors;

      (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any
liability or liabilities of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless
of what liability or liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;

      (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default
under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Designated Interest Rate
Protection Agreement or any Designated Other Hedging Agreement or any of the
instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend,
modify or supplement this Agreement, any Designated other Credit Document, any
Interest Rate Protection Agreement or any Designated Other Hedging Agreement or
any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or

      (h) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable
principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of
Holdings from its liabilities under this Guaranty.

      14.06 Reliance. It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire
into the capacity or powers of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or the
officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their
behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the
professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

      14.07 Subordination. Any indebtedness of the Borrower now or hereafter
owing to Holdings is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations of the
Borrower owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so
requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of the
Borrower to Holdings shall be collected, enforced and received by Holdings for
the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Guaranteed


                                     -109-
<PAGE>
Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting
or impairing in any manner the liability of Holdings under the other provisions
of this Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by Holdings of any note or negotiable
instrument evidencing any such indebtedness of the Borrower to Holdings,
Holdings shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the
same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Holdings hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not
exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a
result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been
irrevocably paid in full in cash.

      14.08 Waiver. (a) Holdings waives any right (except as shall be required
by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor
to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party,
(ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other
guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed
Creditor's power whatsoever. Holdings waives any defense based on or arising out
of any defense of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, other
than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment, based
on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, Holdings, any other
guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of
the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation
from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations to the extent of such payment. The Guaranteed Creditors
may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more
judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is
commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable
law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have
against the Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or
impairing in any way the liability of Holdings hereunder except to the extent
the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid. Holdings waives any defense arising
out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election
operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or
other right or remedy of Holdings against the Borrower or any other party or any
security.

      (b) Holdings waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests
and notices, including without limitation notices of nonperformance, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and
notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed
Obligations. Holdings assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself
informed of the Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other
circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations
and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which Holdings assumes and incurs
hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the other
Guaranteed Creditors shall have any duty to advise Holdings of information known
to them regarding such circumstances or risks.

      14.09 Maximum Liability. It is the desire and intent of Holdings and the
Guaranteed Creditors that this Guaranty shall be enforced against Holdings to
the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in
each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If, however, and to the extent
that, the obligations of Holdings under this Guaranty shall be adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because
of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or
transfers),


                                     -110-
<PAGE>
then the amount of Holdings' obligations under this Guaranty shall be deemed to
be reduced and Holdings shall pay the maximum amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law.

      14.10 Payments. All payments made by Holdings pursuant to this Section 14
will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject
to the provisions of Sections 4.03 and 4.04.


                                      * * *
