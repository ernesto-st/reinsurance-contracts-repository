you violate this Covenant Not to Sue by suing a Released Party, you may be liable
to that party for monetary damages. More specifically, if you sue a Released
Party in violation of this Covenant Not to Sue, you will be required to either:
(1) pay that Released Party&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and other costs incurred
as a result of having to defend against your suit; or (2) alternatively, at the
Released Party&#146;s option, return to the Company your Stay Bonus and your
Amendment Payment, except for one-hundred dollars (&#36;100.00). However, nothing
in this Covenant Not to Sue or in any other part of this Agreement prevents you
from challenging the validity of this Agreement under the ADEA.</font></P>	</TD>
