requirements as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Lender or such Funding Party shall promptly notify Borrower in writing upon becoming aware that Borrower may be required to make the
foregoing compensation to Lender or such Funding Party. Lender or any Funding Party that gives notice as provided herein shall promptly withdraw such notice (by notice to Borrower) whenever Lender or

Any such Manager may be an Affiliate of Borrower, provided that: (a)&nbsp;the terms and conditions of such Manager's engagement are at arm's length, reasonable, competitive and customary in the
applicable marketplace; and (b)&nbsp;Lender has approved such Manager and such terms, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Management Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof, between the Borrower and the Manager is deemed approved by Lender in all respects. Borrower shall cause the Manager of the Mortgaged Property to agree that such Manager's Management Agreement
is subject and subordinate in all respects to the Indebtedness and to the Lien of the Mortgages. A Management Agreement may be terminated or assigned (1)&nbsp;by Borrower at any time in accordance
with the provisions of such Management Agreement so long as a successor or assignee Manager as specified below shall have been appointed and approved and such successor Manager has (i)&nbsp;entered
into (or assumed) a Management Agreement in form and substance approved by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably denied, conditioned or delayed, and (ii)&nbsp;has executed and delivered a
Manager's Subordination to Lender, and (2)&nbsp;by Lender upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days' prior written notice to Borrower and the Manager (a)&nbsp;upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event
of Default or (b)&nbsp;if the Manager commits any act which would permit termination under the Management Agreement (subject to any applicable notice, grace and cure periods provided in the
Management Agreement) or (c)&nbsp;if a change of majority control occurs with respect to the Manager. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any successor manager selected hereunder by Lender or Borrower to
manage the Mortgaged Property shall be a reputable management company having substantial experience in the management of real property of a similar type, size and quality in the state in which the
Mortgaged Property is located. Borrower may from time to time appoint a successor manager to manage the Mortgaged Property with Lender's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any consent or approval requested of Lender under this Section may be conditioned by Lender, at Lender's discretion, upon Borrower first obtaining a
Rating Confirmation with respect to such change in management, and Lender shall not be deemed to be acting unreasonably in requiring such a Rating Confirmation. Borrower further covenants and agrees
that any manager of Mortgaged Property shall at all times while any Indebtedness is outstanding maintain worker's compensation insurance as required by Governmental Authorities. </FONT></P>

Agreement to the contrary, after an assignment by Lender, the "Lender" (prior to such assignment) shall continue to have the benefits of any rights or indemnifications and shall continue to have the
obligations contained herein which Lender had during the period such party was a "Lender" hereunder. Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section&nbsp;2.10 with

Loan and the Account Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof and to exercise any and all other rights of Lender with respect to the Loan as set forth in such servicing agreement. Lender shall
promptly notify Borrower if Lender shall elect to appoint or change the servicer, and all notices and other communications from Borrower to Lender shall be delivered to the servicer with a copy
concurrently delivered to the Lender, and any notice, direction or other communication from the servicer to Borrower shall have the same force and effect as a notice, direction or communication from
