(this &#147;Plan&#148;) is to encourage the employees of Donegal Group Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), its subsidiaries and its affiliates to acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of the Company, and to continue to align the
interests of those employees with the interests of the Company&#146;s stockholders to generate an increased incentive for such persons to contribute to the growth, development and financial success of the Company, Donegal Mutual Insurance Company
and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates (the &#147;Group&#148;). To accomplish these purposes, this Plan provides a means whereby employees may receive stock options, stock awards and other stock-based awards that are based on, or measured
by or payable in shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Administration</U>. </P>

The Board shall appoint a committee, the initial members of which shall be the members of the compensation committee of the Board (the &#147;Committee&#148;), to assist in the administration of this Plan. The Committee, with the advice of the
Company&#146;s chief executive officer, shall recommend to the Board the employees to whom the Company should grant awards and the type, size and terms of each grant. The Board has the authority to make all other determinations necessary or
advisable for the administration of this Plan. All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all grantees and all other holders of awards granted under this Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>The Committee</U>. The Committee shall be comprised of two or more members of the Board, each of whom shall be a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;non-employee</FONT> director&#148; within the meaning of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Rule&nbsp;16b-3</FONT> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). In addition, each
member of the Committee shall be an &#147;outside director&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). Subject to the foregoing, from time to time, the Board may increase
or decrease the size of the Committee, appoint additional members, remove members with or without cause, appoint new members, fill vacancies or remove all members of the Committee and thereafter directly administer this Plan. The Committee shall
have those duties and responsibilities assigned to it under this Plan, and the Board may assign to the Committee the authority to make certain other determinations and interpretations under this Plan. All decisions, determinations and
interpretations of the Committee in such cases shall be final and binding on all grantees and all other holders of awards granted under this Plan. </P>

issue under this Plan is 4,500,000 shares, subject to adjustment as described below, each of which may be granted as incentive stock options. The shares may be authorized but unissued shares or reacquired shares for purposes of this Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Share Counting</U>. For administrative purposes, when the Board approves an award payable in shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock, the Board shall reserve, and count against the share limit, shares equal to the maximum number of shares that the Company may issue under the award. If and to the extent options granted under this Plan terminate, expire or
are canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without having been exercised, and if and to the extent that any restricted stock awards are forfeited or terminated, or otherwise are not issued in full, the Company shall make the shares reserved
for such awards available again for purposes of this Plan. </P>

Only the grantee of an award may exercise rights under the award during the grantee&#146;s lifetime, and a grantee may not transfer those rights except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. When a grantee dies, the personal
representative or other person entitled to succeed to the rights of the grantee may exercise those rights. Any successor to a grantee must furnish proof satisfactory to the Company of the grantee&#146;s right to succeed to the award under the

The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which the Company&#146;s counsel has deemed such authority to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares under this Plan, shall relieve
the Company of any liability for the failure to issue or sell any shares as to which the Company has not obtained such requisite authority. The Board shall have the right to condition any award made to any employee under this Plan on the
employee&#146;s undertaking in writing to comply with the restrictions on the grantee&#146;s subsequent disposition of shares subject to the award as the Board shall deem necessary or advisable. Certificates representing shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock issued under this Plan shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as applicable laws, regulations and interpretations may require, including any requirement that the certificate bear a restrictive legend. No
grantee shall have any right as a stockholder with respect to shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock covered by an award until shares have been issued to the grantee. </P>
