                                     -25-

<PAGE>

         (b)      Terms of Letters of Credit. At the time of issuance, the
amount, form, terms and conditions of each Letter of Credit, and of any drafts
or acceptances thereunder, shall be subject to approval by the Agent and the
Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the expiration date of
any Letter of Credit extend beyond the date 10 days prior to the Termination
Date, and any Letter of Credit containing an automatic renewal provision shall
also contain a provision pursuant to which, notwithstanding any other
provisions thereof, it shall have a final expiration date no later than the
date 10 days prior to the Termination Date.

         (c)      Requests for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower
shall give the Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date 3 Business Days prior to the
requested date of issuance of a Letter of Credit, such notice to describe in
reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Letter of Credit and the nature of

Credit, and in any event shall set forth with respect to such Letter of Credit
(i) the proposed initial Stated Amount, (ii) the beneficiary or beneficiaries,
(iii) whether such Letter of Credit is a commercial or standby letter of credit
and (iv) the proposed expiration date. The Borrower shall also execute and
deliver such customary letter of credit application forms as reasonably
requested from time to time by the Agent. Provided the Borrower has given the
notice required by this subsection and subject to Section 2.14. and the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the satisfaction of any
applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article V., the Agent shall issue
the requested Letter of Credit on the requested date of issuance. Upon the
written request of the Borrower, the Agent shall deliver to the Borrower a copy
of each issued Letter of Credit within a reasonable time after the date of
issuance thereof. To the extent any term of a Letter of Credit Document is
inconsistent with a term of any Credit Document, the term of such Credit
Document shall control.

         (d)      Reimbursement Obligations. Upon receipt by the Agent from the
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of any demand for payment under such Letter
of Credit, the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the amount to be
paid by the Agent as a result of such demand and the date on which payment is
to be made by the Agent to such beneficiary in respect of such demand. The
Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay and reimburse the
Agent for the amount of each demand for payment under such Letter of Credit on
or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by the Agent to the
beneficiary thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other
formalities of any kind. Upon receipt by the Agent of any payment in respect of
any Reimbursement Obligation, the Agent shall promptly pay to each Lender that
has acquired a participation therein under the second sentence of Section

finance its obligation to reimburse the Agent for the amount of the related
demand for payment and, if it does, the Borrower shall submit a timely Notice
of Borrowing or Notice of Swingline Borrowing, as appropriate. If the Borrower
fails to so advise the Agent, or if the Borrower fails to reimburse the Agent
for a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit by the date of such payment,
then (i) if the applicable conditions contained in Article V. would permit the
making of Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall be


                                     -26-

<PAGE>

deemed to have requested a borrowing of Revolving Loans (which shall be Base
Rate Loans) in an amount equal to the unpaid Reimbursement Obligation and the
Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of the amount of the Revolving Loan
(which shall not be subject to the limitations of Section 3.5.) to be made by
such Lender, the proceeds of which such Lender shall make available to the
Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. and (ii) if such conditions would not permit the
making of Revolving Loans, the provisions of subsection (j) of this Section
shall apply.

         (f)      Effect of Letters of Credit on Commitments. Upon the issuance
by the Agent of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall have
expired or been terminated, the Commitment of each Lender shall be deemed to be
utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in an amount equal to such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit plus any
related Reimbursement Obligations then outstanding.

         (g)      Agent's Duties Regarding Letters of Credit; Unconditional
Nature of Reimbursement Obligation. In examining documents presented in
connection with drawings under Letters of Credit and making payments under such
Letters of Credit against such documents, the Agent shall use the same standard
of care as it uses in connection with examining documents presented in
connection with drawings under letters of credit in which it has not sold
participations and making payments under such letters of credit. The Borrower
assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of
Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any
of the Lenders shall be responsible for (i) the form, validity, sufficiency,
accuracy, genuineness or legal effects of any document submitted by any party
in connection with the application for and issuance of or in connection with
any drawing honored under any Letter of Credit even if it should in fact prove
to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or
forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit, or the
rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which
may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in
order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions
or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telex,
telecopy or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher absent gross negligence
or willful misconduct by the Agent or except to the extent found in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a binding
determination of any arbitral body, as applicable, to have resulted from the
bad faith of the Agent; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms absent
gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Agent or except to the extent
found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction
or by a binding determination of any arbitral body, as applicable, to have
resulted from the bad faith of the Agent; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing
under any Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of the Agent or the Lenders. None of the above
shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the Agent's rights or
powers hereunder. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent under or
in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create against the Agent any
liability to the Borrower or any Lender;


                                     -27-

<PAGE>

provided, however, nothing contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any remedy the Borrower may have against the Agent or
any Lender to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, or to the extent
resulting from the bad faith of the Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, as
determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by binding arbitration, as applicable. In this connection, the
obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Agent for any drawing made under
any Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation, the following
circumstances: (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit Document or any term or provisions therein; (B) any amendment or waiver
of or any consent to departure from all or any of the Letter of Credit
Documents; (C) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
the Borrower may have at any time against the Agent, any Lender, any
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in the Letter of
Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (D) any breach of contract or
dispute between the Borrower, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person; (E)
any demand, statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit
proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein or made in connection therewith being untrue or inaccurate in
any respect whatsoever; (F) any non-application or misapplication by the
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such
Letter of Credit; (G) payment by the Agent under the Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or certificate which does not strictly comply, but
which does substantially comply, with the terms of the Letter of Credit; and
(H) any other act, omission to act, delay or circumstance whatsoever that
might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
defense to or discharge of the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations. Nothing
herein provides a waiver of any remedies the Borrower may have for (i) the
Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) actions
taken (or not taken) by the Agent or the Lenders to the extent found in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
binding determination of any arbitral body, as applicable, to have been taken
(or not taken) in bad faith.

         (h)      Amendments, Etc. The issuance by the Agent of any amendment,
supplement or other modification to any Letter of Credit shall be subject to
the same conditions applicable under this Agreement to the issuance of new
Letters of Credit (including, without limitation, that the request therefor be
made through the Agent), and no such amendment, supplement or other
modification shall be issued unless either (i) the respective Letter of Credit
affected thereby would have complied with such conditions had it originally
been issued hereunder in such amended, supplemented or modified form or (ii)
the Requisite Lenders shall have consented thereto.

         (i)      Lenders' Participation in Letters of Credit. Immediately upon
the issuance by the Agent of any Letter of Credit each Lender shall be deemed
to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the Agent,
without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the
extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the liability of the Agent
with respect to such Letter of Credit and each Lender thereby shall absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety,
and


                                     -28-

<PAGE>

shall be unconditionally obligated to the Agent to pay and discharge when due,
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Agent's liability under such Letter
of Credit. In addition, upon the making of each payment by a Lender to the
Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit pursuant to the immediately following
subsection (j), such Lender shall, automatically and without any further action
on the part of the Agent or such Lender, acquire (i) a participation in an
amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation owing to the Agent
by the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit and (ii) a participation in
a percentage equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage in any interest or
other amounts payable by the Borrower in respect of such Reimbursement
Obligation (other than the Fees payable to the Agent pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 3.6.(b)).

         (j)      Payment Obligation of Lenders. Each Lender severally agrees
to pay to the Agent on demand in immediately available funds in Dollars the
amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of each drawing paid by the Agent
under each Letter of Credit to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2.(d) and is not available from funds then on
deposit in the Collateral Account. Each such Lender's obligation to make such
payments to the Agent under this subsection, and the Agent's right to receive
the same, shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be
affected in any way by any circumstance whatsoever, including without
limitation, (i) the failure of any other Lender to make its payment under this
subsection, (ii) the financial condition of the Borrower or any other Loan
Party, (iii) the existence of any Default or Event of Default, including any
Event of Default described in Section 10.1.(e) or 10.1.(f) or (iv) the
termination of the Commitments. Each such payment to the Agent shall be made
without any offset, abatement, withholding or deduction whatsoever.

         (k)      Information to Lenders. Upon the request of any Lender from
time to time, the Agent shall deliver to such Lender any information reasonably
requested by such Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit then
outstanding. Other than as set forth in this subsection, the Agent shall have
no duty to notify the Lenders regarding the issuance or other matters regarding
Letters of Credit issued hereunder. The failure of the Agent to perform its
requirements under this subsection shall not relieve any Lender from its
obligations under Section 2.2.(j).

limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder. Each Notice of Continuation shall
be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower once given. Promptly after
receipt of a Notice of Continuation, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the
proposed Continuation. If the Borrower shall fail to select in a timely manner
a new Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Section, such
Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period
therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan notwithstanding failure of the Borrower
to comply with Section 2.8.

SECTION 2.8. CONVERSION.

         So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing (as to a Conversion from a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan), the
Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrower's giving of a Notice of
Conversion to the Agent, Convert all or a portion of a Loan of one Type into a
Loan of another Type. Any Conversion of a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan
shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such
LIBOR Loan. Each such Notice of Conversion shall be given not later than 11:00
a.m. on the date of any proposed Conversion into Base Rate Loans and on the
third Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into LIBOR
Loans. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Agent shall notify
each Lender of the proposed Conversion. Subject to the restrictions specified
above, each Notice of Conversion shall be in writing and in the form of a
Notice of Conversion specifying (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b)
the Type of Loan to be Converted, (c) the portion of such Type of Loan to be
Converted, (d) the Type of Loan such Loan is to be Converted into and (e) if
such Conversion is into a LIBOR Loan, the requested duration of the Interest
Period of such Loan. Each Notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable by and
binding on the Borrower once given.

SECTION 2.9. NOTES.

         (a)      Revolving Note. The Revolving Loans made by each Lender
shall, in addition to this Agreement, also be evidenced by a promissory note of
the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit N (each a "Revolving Note"),
payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the amount
of its Commitment as originally in effect and otherwise duly completed.

         (b)      Records; Endorsement on Transfer. The date, amount of each
Revolving Loan made by each Lender to the Borrower, and each payment made on
account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books
and such entries shall be binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. Prior
to the transfer of any Note, the Lender shall endorse such items on such Note
or any allonge thereof; provided that the failure of such Lender to make any
such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the
Borrower to make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder or under such
Note in respect of the Loans evidenced by such Note.

SECTION 2.10. VOLUNTARY REDUCTIONS OF THE COMMITMENTS.

         The Borrower shall have the right to terminate or reduce the aggregate
unused amount of the Commitments at any time and from time to time without
penalty or premium upon not less than 5 Business Days prior written notice to
the Agent of each such termination or reduction, which notice shall specify the
effective date thereof and the amount of any such reduction and shall be
irrevocable once given and effective only upon receipt by the Agent. The Agent
will promptly transmit such notice to each Lender. The Commitments, once
terminated or reduced may not be increased or reinstated.

SECTION 2.11. EXPIRATION OR MATURITY DATE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT PAST TERMINATION
DATE.

         If on the date (the "Facility Termination Date") the Commitments are
terminated (whether voluntarily, by reason of the occurrence of an Event of
Default or otherwise), there are any Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder,
the Borrower shall, on the Facility Termination Date, pay to the Agent an
amount of money equal to the Stated Amount of such Letter(s) of Credit for
deposit into the Collateral Account. If a drawing pursuant to any such Letter
of Credit occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit,
the Borrower authorizes the Agent to use the monies deposited in the Collateral
Account to make payment to the beneficiary with respect to such drawing or the
payee with respect to such presentment.

SECTION 2.12. INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS.

         At any time during the 18-month period immediately following the
Agreement Date, the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable one time, to
request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an amount not
to exceed $35,000,000 by providing written notice to the Agent at least 90 days
prior to the proposed effective date of such increase, which notice shall be
irrevocable once given. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any such
request. No Lender shall be obligated in any way whatsoever to increase its
Commitment. If a


                                     -32-

<PAGE>

new Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, or if any existing Lender agrees
to increase its Commitment, such Lender shall on the date it becomes a Lender
hereunder (or in the case of an existing Lender, increases its Commitment) (and
as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Lenders its Commitment
Percentage (determined with respect to the Lenders' relative Commitments and
after giving effect to the increase of Commitments) of any outstanding
Revolving Loans, by making available to the Agent for the account of such other
Lenders, in same day funds, an amount equal to the sum of (A) the portion of
the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans to be purchased by
such Lender plus (B) interest accrued and unpaid to and as of such date on such
portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Loans. The Borrower shall
pay to the Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Lenders under Section 4.4.
as a result of the prepayment of any such Loans. An increase of the aggregate
amount of the Commitments may not be effected under this Section if (x) the
Requisite Lenders have not notified the Agent in writing on or prior to the
date which is 30 days subsequent to the date on which the Borrower requested
such increase that they consent to such increase, (y) a Default or Event of
Default shall be in existence on the effective date of such increase or (z) any
representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower or any other
Loan Party in any Loan Document to which such Loan Party is a party is not (or
would not be) true or correct on the effective date of such increase except to
the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to
an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have
been true and accurate on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes
in factual circumstances specifically and expressly permitted hereunder. In
connection with an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant
to this Section (a) any Lender becoming a party hereto shall execute such
documents and agreements as the Agent may reasonably request and (b) the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that each new Lender, and any
existing Lender increasing its Commitment, receives a new or replacement Note,
as appropriate, in the amount of such Lender's Commitment at the time of the
effectiveness of the increase in the aggregate amount of Commitments.

SECTION 2.13. SWINGLINE LOANS.

         (a)      Swingline Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
including without limitation, Section 2.14., the Swingline Lender agrees to
make Swingline Loans to the Borrower, during the period from the Closing Date
to but excluding the Termination Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any
one time outstanding up to, but not exceeding, the amount of the Swingline
Commitment. If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
Swingline Loans exceeds the Swingline Commitment in effect at such time, the
Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of the Swingline
Lender the amount of such excess. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swingline Loans
hereunder. The borrowing of a Swingline Loan shall not constitute usage of any
Lender's Commitment for purposes of calculation of the fee payable under
Section 3.6.(a) or otherwise.

         (b)      Procedure for Borrowing Swingline Loans. With respect to any
Swingline Loan not being made to the Borrower as contemplated under subsection
(f) below, the Borrower shall give the Agent and Swingline Lender notice
pursuant to a Notice of Swingline Borrowing or pursuant to a notice otherwise
given to the Agent and Swingline Lender in such manner, and no later than such
time, as may be agreed to by the Borrower and the Swingline Lender in writing


                                     -33-

<PAGE>

from time to time. Not later than such time as may be agreed to by the Borrower
and the Swingline Lender from time to time and subject to satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article V. for such borrowing, the Swingline
Lender will make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower
in Dollars, in immediately available funds, at the account specified by the
Borrower in the Notice of Swingline Borrowing.

         (c)      Interest. Swingline Loans shall bear interest (i) at a per
annum rate equal to the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time) per annum or
(ii) at such other rate or rates as the Borrower and Swingline Lender may agree
from time to time in writing. Interest payable on Swingline Loans is solely for
the account of the Swingline Lender. All accrued and unpaid interest on
Swingline Loans shall be payable on the dates and in the manner provided in
Section 2.3. with respect to interest on Base Rate Loans (except as the
Swingline Lender and the Borrower may otherwise agree in writing in connection
with any particular Swingline Loan).

         (d)      Swingline Note. The Swingline Loans shall, in addition to
this Agreement, be evidenced by the Swingline Note.

         (e)      Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans. The Borrower
agrees to repay each Swingline Loan within one Business Day of demand therefor
by the Swingline Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall
repay the entire outstanding principal amount of, and all accrued but unpaid
interest on, the Swingline Loans on the Termination Date (or such earlier date
as the Swingline Lender and the Borrower may agree in writing). In lieu of
demanding repayment of any outstanding Swingline Loan from the Borrower, the
Swingline Lender may at any time, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), request a
borrowing of Base Rate Loans (which shall not be subject to the amount
limitations of Section 3.5.) from the Lenders in an aggregate amount equal to
the principal balance of such Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender shall give
notice to the Agent of any such borrowing of Base Rate Loans not later than
11:00 a.m. on the proposed date of such borrowing. Each Lender will make
available to the Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender, in immediately
available funds, the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Lender. The Agent
shall pay the proceeds of such Loans to the Swingline Lender, which shall apply
such proceeds to repay such Swingline Loan. If Lenders are prohibited from
making Loans required to be made under this subsection for any reason
whatsoever, including without limitation, the occurrence of any of the Defaults
or Events of Default described in Sections 10.1.(e) or 10.1.(f), each Lender
shall purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of such Swingline Loan, by directly purchasing a participation in such
Swingline Loan in such amount and paying the proceeds thereof to the Agent for
the account of the Swingline Lender in Dollars and in immediately available
funds. A Lender's obligation to purchase such a participation in a Swingline
Loan shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) any claim of setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other
Person may have or claim against the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other
Person whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of
Default (including without limitation, any of the Defaults or Events of Default
described in Sections 10.1.(e) or (f)) or the termination of any Lender's
Commitment, (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of an event of condition


                                     -34-

<PAGE>

which has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of any
Credit Document by the Agent, any Lender or the Borrower or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing. If such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline
Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such
amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for
each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lender's demand
therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the required payment, the
Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline
Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of
the Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other Lenders to
purchase a participation therein). Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have
assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and
any other amounts due to it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund
Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such
Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section until such amount has been
purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise).

         (f)      Auto Borrow/Auto Sweep Programs. Until the occurrence of a
Default or Event of Default, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested
that the Swingline Lender make to the Borrower at 5:00 p.m. on each Business
Day a Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the amount by which drafts against
the Operating Account exceed the available balance of funds then on deposit in
the Operating Account. The Agent shall notify the Swingline Lender of the
amount of such excess. The Swingline Lender shall make the proceeds of each
such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by paying the same to the Agent
for deposit into the Operating Account. At 5:00 p.m. on each Business Day, the
Borrower shall repay a principal amount of Swingline Loans by an amount equal
to the positive balance, if any, of available funds then on deposit in the
Operating Account as determined by the Agent at such time. The Borrower hereby
authorizes the Agent to deduct such amount from the Operating Account without
notice to the Borrower, and to pay such amount to the Swingline Lender in
repayment of the then outstanding principal balance of Swingline Loans.

SECTION 2.14. AMOUNT LIMITATIONS.

         Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, at no time may the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
Liabilities and the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline
Loans, exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as in effect at that
time.

            ARTICLE III. PAYMENTS, FEES AND OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 3.1. PAYMENTS.

         (a)      Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments
of principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made in Dollars, in immediately
available funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Agent at
its Principal Office, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date on which such
payment shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due
date to be


                                     -35-

<PAGE>

deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day). Subject to
Sections 3.2. and 3.3., the Agent, or any Lender for whose account any such
payment is made, may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any
such payment which is not made by such time from any special or general deposit
account of the Borrower with the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be (with
notice to the Borrower, the other Lenders and the Agent). The Borrower shall,
at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note, specify to
the Agent the amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment
is to be applied. Each payment received by the Agent for the account of a
Lender under this Agreement or any Note shall be paid to such Lender at the
applicable Lending Office of such Lender no later than 5:00 p.m. on the date of
receipt. Each payment received by Agent for the account of Swingline Lender
under this Agreement or the Swingline Note shall be paid to Swingline Lender in
accordance with the payment instructions provided by Swingline Lender to the
Agent from time to time. If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or
any other Credit Document would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business
Day such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and
interest shall be payable for the period of such extension.

         (b)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Agent,
prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Agent
hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make
such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required
to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person
entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment is not in fact made to
the Agent in immediately available funds, then:

                  (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the portion of
         such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in
         immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect
         of each day from and including the date such amount was made available
         by the Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the
         Agent in immediately available funds, at the Federal Funds Rate from
         time to time in effect; and

                  (ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Agent the amount thereof
         in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the
         period from the date such amount was made available by the Agent to
         the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Agent (the
         "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to
         the Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan to the
         Borrower. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
         Agent's demand therefor, the Agent may make a demand therefor upon the
         Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent,
         together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate
         per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable
         Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
         obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which
         the Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of
         any default by such Lender hereunder.


                                     -36-

<PAGE>

         A notice of the Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing
under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

SECTION 3.2. PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing
from the Lenders under Section 2.1.(a) shall be made from the Lenders, each
payment of the Fees under Section 3.6.(a) and the first sentence of Section
3.6.(b) shall be made for the account of the Lenders, and each termination or
reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.10. or otherwise,
shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata
according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) each payment or
prepayment of principal of Revolving Loans by the Borrower shall be made for
the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid
principal amounts of the Revolving Loans held by them, provided that if
immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any
Revolving Loans the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans shall
not be held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made, then such payment shall
be applied to the Revolving Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as
is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans
being held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitments; (c) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans by the Borrower
shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the
amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective
Lenders; (d) the making, Conversion and Continuation of Revolving Loans of a
particular Type (other than Conversions provided for by Section 4.5.) shall be
made pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective
Commitments (in the case of making of Loans) or their respective Loans (in the
case of Conversions and Continuations of Loans) and the then current Interest
Period for each Lender's portion of each Loan of such Type shall be
coterminous; and (e) the Lenders' participation in, and payment obligations in
respect of and receipt of payments with respect to, Letters of Credit under
Section 2.2. and Swingline Loans under Section 2.13., shall be pro rata in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

SECTION 3.3. SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.

         If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on,
any Loan made by it to the Borrower under this Agreement, or shall obtain
payment on any other Obligation owing by the Borrower or a Loan Party through
the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar
right or otherwise or through voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender or
other payments made by the Borrower to a Lender not in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and such payment should be distributed to the Lenders
pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 10.4., as applicable, such
Lender shall promptly pay such amounts to the other Lenders and make such other
adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the
Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any reasonable expenses
which may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit)
pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 10.4. To such end, all the
Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of
participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation (or direct interest) in the Loans or other Obligations owed to
such


                                     -37-

<PAGE>

other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim
or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation. Nothing
contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall
affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of
exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation
of the Borrower. All payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts in
respect of the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of Swingline Lender
only (except to the extent any Lender shall have acquired a participating
interest in any such Swingline Loan pursuant to Section 2.13.(e)).

SECTION 3.4. SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS.

         No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such
other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to
perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not
relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any
other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.

SECTION 3.5. MINIMUM AMOUNTS.

         (a)      Borrowings. Each borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in an
aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in
excess thereof. Each borrowing of LIBOR Loans shall be in an aggregate minimum
amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that
amount.

         (b)      Prepayments. Each voluntary prepayment of Revolving Loans
shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
$100,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amount as may be the outstanding
principal amount of such Revolving Loans).

         (c)      Reductions of Commitments. Each reduction of the Commitments
under Section 2.10. shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amount as may
be the remaining aggregate amount of the Commitments).

         (d)      Conversions. Each Conversion of a Loan from a Base Rate Loan
to a LIBOR Loan shall be in an aggregate minimum amount for the Loans of all
Lenders of $1,000,000 or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.

         (e)      Letters of Credit. The initial Stated Amount of each Letter
of Credit shall be at least $50,000.

SECTION 3.6. FEES.

         (a)      Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for
the account of the Lenders a commitment fee on the average daily amount by
which the Commitments (as the amount of the Commitments may be reduced or
increased from time to time pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) exceed the
aggregate principal balance of all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with
the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, at a rate per annum


                                     -38-

<PAGE>

equal to (i) the Applicable Commitment Fee with respect to any fiscal quarter
during which the average daily amount by which the Commitments (as the amount
of the Commitments may be reduced or increased from time to time pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise) exceed the aggregate principal balance of all
outstanding Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter
of Credit Liabilities, is less than fifty percent (50%) of such Commitments, or
(ii) the Applicable Commitment Fee plus 0.15% with respect to any fiscal
quarter during which the average daily amount by which the Commitments (as the
amount of the Commitments may be reduced or increased from time to time
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) exceed the aggregate principal balance
of all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all
Letter of Credit Liabilities, is equal to or greater than fifty percent (50%)
of such Commitments. Such commitment fee shall be payable for the period from
and including the Agreement Date to but excluding the earlier of the date the
Commitments are terminated or reduced to zero or the Termination Date. As
provided in the last sentence of Section 2.13.(a), the borrowing of a Swingline
Loan shall not constitute usage of any Lender's Commitment for purposes of
calculating such commitment fee. Such commitment fee shall be payable in
arrears on (i) the last Business Day of March, June, September and December in
each year commencing with June 30, 2002, (ii) on the Termination Date, and
(iii) on the date the Commitments are otherwise terminated or reduced to zero.

         (b)      Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent for the account of each Lender a letter of credit fee at a rate per annum
equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans of the daily average Stated
Amount of each Letter of Credit for the period from and including the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the date such Letter of
Credit is drawn in full, expires or is terminated. The Borrower also agrees to
pay to the Agent for its own account a fronting fee in respect of each Letter
of Credit at a rate per annum equal to one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) of
the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit for the period from and including
the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the date such
Letter of Credit is drawn in full, expires or is terminated. The fees provided
for in the immediately preceding two sentences shall be nonrefundable and paid
in arrears (i) the last Business Day of March, June, September and December in
each year commencing with June 30, 2002, (ii) on the Termination Date, (iii) on
the date the Commitments are terminated or reduced to zero and (iv) thereafter
from time to time on demand of the Agent. The Borrower shall pay directly to
the Agent from time to time on demand all commissions, charges, costs and
expenses in the amounts customarily charged by the Agent from time to time in
like circumstances with respect to the issuance of each Letter of Credit,
drawings, amendments and other transactions relating thereto.

         (c)      Administrative and Other Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the
administrative and other fees of the Agent and BAS, and any other Fees of the
Lenders, as may be agreed to in writing from time to time.

SECTION 3.7. COMPUTATIONS.

         Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on
any Loan and any other Obligations due hereunder, and any Fees due hereunder,
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of
days elapsed; provided, however, accrued interest on


                                     -39-

<PAGE>

any Base Rate Loan shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
as applicable, and the actual number of days elapsed.

SECTION 3.8. USURY.

         In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans
or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable
Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or received by any Lender,
then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the
Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower elects
to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith. It is the express intent of
the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive,
directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that
which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.

SECTION 3.9. AGREEMENT REGARDING INTEREST AND CHARGES.

         The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge
imposed upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection with this
Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in Section
2.3.(a) and, with respect to Swingline Loans, in Section 2.13.(c).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate
that all agency fees, syndication fees, commitment fees, letter of credit fees,
underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or "breakage"
charges, increased cost charges, attorneys' fees and reimbursement for costs
and expenses paid by the Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages
incurred by the Agent or any Lender, are charges made to compensate the Agent
or any such Lender for underwriting or administrative services and costs or
losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Agent and
the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances
be deemed to be charges for the use of money pursuant to Official Code of
Georgia Annotated Sections 7-4-2 and 7-4-18. All charges other than charges for
the use of money shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when due.

SECTION 3.10. STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT.

         The Agent will account to the Borrower with a statement of Loans,
Letters of Credit, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments made
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and such statement
rendered by the Agent shall be deemed conclusive upon Borrower absent manifest
error. The failure of the Agent to deliver such a statement shall not relieve
or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 3.11. DEFAULTING LENDERS.

         (a)      Generally. If for any reason any Lender (a "Defaulting
Lender") shall fail or refuse to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document to which it is a party within the time
period specified for performance of such obligation or, if no time period is
specified, if such failure or refusal continues for a period of two Business
Days after notice from the Agent, then, in addition to the rights and remedies
that may be available to the Agent or the Borrower under this Agreement or
Applicable Law, such Defaulting Lender's right to participate in the
administration of the Loans, this Agreement and the other Credit


                                     -40-

<PAGE>

Documents, including without limitation, any right to vote in respect of, to
consent to or to direct any action or inaction of the Agent or to be taken into
account in the calculation of the Requisite Lenders, shall be suspended during
the pendency of such failure or refusal. If a Lender is a Defaulting Lender
because it has failed to make timely payment to the Agent of any amount
required to be paid to the Agent hereunder (without giving effect to any notice
or cure periods), in addition to other rights and remedies which the Agent or
the Borrower may have under the immediately preceding provisions or otherwise,
the Agent shall be entitled (i) to collect interest from such Defaulting Lender
in accordance with Section 3.1.(b), (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in
satisfaction of the defaulted payment and any related interest, any amounts
otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement or any other
Credit Document and (iii) to bring an action or suit against such Defaulting
Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and
any related interest. Any amounts received by the Agent in respect of a
Defaulting Lender's Loans shall not be paid to such Defaulting Lender and shall
be held uninvested by the Agent and either applied against the purchase price
of such Loans under the following subsection (b) or paid to such Defaulting
Lender upon the Defaulting Lender's curing of its default.

         (b)      Purchase of Defaulting Lender's Commitment. Any Lender who is
not a Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its
sole discretion, to acquire all of a Defaulting Lender's Commitment and Loans.
Any Lender desiring to exercise such right shall give written notice thereof to
the Agent no sooner than 2 Business Days and not later than 10 Business Days
after such Defaulting Lender became a Defaulting Lender. If more than one
Lender exercises such right, each such Lender shall have the right to acquire
an amount of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment and Loans in proportion to the
Commitments and Loans of the other Lenders exercising such right. If after such
10th Business Day, the Lenders have not elected to purchase all of the
Commitment and Loans of such Defaulting Lender, then any Eligible Assignee may
purchase such Commitment and Loans. Neither the Agent nor any of the Lenders
shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to
assist in finding an Eligible Assignee. Upon any such purchase, the Defaulting
Lender's interest in the Loans and its rights hereunder (but not its liability
in respect thereof or under the Credit Documents or this Agreement to the
extent the same relate to the period prior to the effective date of the
purchase) shall terminate on the date of purchase, and the Defaulting Lender
shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and
transfer such interest to the purchaser thereof, including an appropriate
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and, notwithstanding Section 12.5.(d),
shall pay to the Agent an assignment fee in the amount of $7,000. The purchase
price for the Commitment and Loans of a Defaulting Lender shall be equal to the
amount of the principal balance of the Loans outstanding and owed by the
Borrower to the Defaulting Lender. Prior to payment of such purchase price to a
Defaulting Lender, the Agent shall apply against such purchase price any
amounts retained by the Agent pursuant to the last sentence of the immediately
preceding subsection (a). The Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive
amounts owed to it by the Borrower under the Credit Documents which accrued
prior to the date of the default by the Defaulting Lender, to the extent the
same are received by the Agent from or on behalf of the Borrower. There shall
be no recourse against any Lender or the Agent for the payment of such sums
except to the extent of the receipt of payments from any other party or in
respect of the Loans. If, prior to a Lender's acquisition of a Defaulting
Lender's Commitment and Loans pursuant to this subsection, such Defaulting
Lender


                                     -41-

<PAGE>

shall cure the event or condition which caused it to become a Defaulting Lender
to the satisfaction of the Agent and shall have paid all amounts owing by it
hereunder as a result thereof, then such Lender shall no longer have the right
to acquire such Defaulting Lender's Commitment or Loans.

SECTION 3.12. TAXES.

         (a)      Taxes Generally. All payments by the Borrower of principal
of, and interest on, the Loans and all other Obligations shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for any present or future excise, stamp or other
taxes, fees, duties, levies, imposts, charges, deductions, withholdings or
other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but
excluding the following (collectively, "Excluded Taxes"): (i) franchise taxes,
(ii) any taxes (other than withholding taxes) that would not be imposed but for
a connection between the Agent or a Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such
taxes (other than a connection arising solely by virtue of the activities of
the Agent or such Lender pursuant to or in respect of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document), (iii) any taxes imposed on or measured by any Lender's
assets, net income, receipts or branch profits and (iv) any taxes arising after
the Agreement Date solely as a result of or attributable to a Lender changing
its designated Lending Office after the date such Lender becomes a party hereto
(such items other than Excluded Taxes being collectively called "Taxes"). If
any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower
hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any Applicable Law,
then the Borrower will:

                  (i)      pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority
         the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;

                  (ii)     promptly forward to the Agent an official receipt or
         other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Agent evidencing
         such payment to such Governmental Authority; and

                  (iii)    pay to the Agent for its account or the account of
         the applicable Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or
         amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually
         received by the Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that
         the Agent or such Lender would have received had no such withholding
         or deduction been required.

         (b)      Tax Indemnification. If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes
when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the
Agent, for its account or the account of the respective Lender, as the case may
be, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower
shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest
or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of
any such failure. For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the
Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a
payment by the Borrower.

         (c)      Tax Forms. Prior to the date that any Lender or participant
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America
becomes a party hereto, such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent
such certificates, documents or other evidence, as


                                     -42-

<PAGE>

required by the Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including
Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate
successor forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by
such Lender or participant establishing that payments to it hereunder and under
the Notes are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax
or (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax under the Code
because such payment is either effectively connected with the conduct by such
Lender or participant of a trade or business in the United States or totally
exempt from United States Federal withholding tax by reason of the application
of the provisions of a treaty to which the United States is a party or such
Lender is otherwise exempt. Any Lender who fails to remit to the Borrower or
the Agent any such required certificates, documents, evidence or necessary
forms shall reimburse the Borrower and the Agent for any penalties paid by the
Borrower or the Agent, as applicable, to the extent resulting of the failure of
the Borrower or the Agent, as applicable, to withhold the required amounts that
are caused by such Lender's failure to provide such items when due.

         (d)      Refunds and Credits. If the Agent or any Lender shall become
aware that it is entitled to a refund or credit in respect of Taxes for which
it has been indemnified by the Borrower pursuant to this Section, the Agent or
such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of the availability of such
refund or credit and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written request
by the Borrower, apply for such refund or credit at the Borrower's sole cost
and expense. So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, if the Agent or any Lender shall receive a refund or credit in
respect of any such Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section, the Agent or such Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrower of such refund or credit and shall, within 10 days of receipt or any
refund or the effective date of any credit, pay such refund or an amount equal
to the amount of such credit, as the case may be, but only to the extent of
amounts that have been paid by the Borrower under this Section with respect to
such refund and not previously reimbursed, to the Borrower, net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Agent and without
interest (other than the interest, if any, included in such refund or in
respect of such credit).

                       ARTICLE IV. YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.

SECTION 4.1. ADDITIONAL COSTS; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         (a)      Additional Costs. The Borrower shall promptly pay to the
Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender
may determine in good faith to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any
costs incurred by such Lender that it reasonably determines are attributable to
its making or maintaining of any Loans or its obligation to make any Loans
hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this
Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents in respect of any of such Loans
or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of
its Loans or its Commitments (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts
receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any
Regulatory Change that: (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts
payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents in respect of any of such Loans or its Commitments (other than with
respect to Excluded Taxes); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirements (including, without limitation, any reserves
required to be maintained against (1) "Eurocurrency


                                     -43-

<PAGE>

liabilities" as specified in Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or (2) any other category of liabilities which includes
deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined
or (3) any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes
loans by an office of any Lender outside of the United States of America to
residents of the United States of America) relating to any extensions of credit
or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender,
or any commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the
Commitments of such Lender hereunder); or (iii) has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender to a level below that
which such Lender could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking
into consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy).

         (b)      Lender's Suspension of LIBOR Loans. Without limiting the
effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsection (a), if by
reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs
based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a
category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits
by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as
provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other
assets of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to
restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it
may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy
to the Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert
any other Type of Loans into, LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until
such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of
Section 4.5. shall apply).

         (c)      Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. Without
limiting the obligations of the Borrower under the preceding subsections of
this Section (but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change
or any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement heretofore or
hereafter issued by any Governmental Authority there shall be imposed, modified
or deemed applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or
similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to
Letters of Credit and the result shall be to increase the cost to the Agent of
issuing (or any Lender purchasing participations in) or maintaining its
obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of
Credit or reduce any amount receivable by the Agent or any Lender hereunder in
respect of any Letter of Credit, then, upon demand by the Agent or such Lender,
the Borrower shall pay immediately to the Agent for its account or the account
of such Lender, as applicable, from time to time as specified by the Agent or a
Lender, such additional amounts as the Agent or such Lender, as the case may
be, shall have determined in good faith to be sufficient to compensate the
Agent or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.

         (d)      Notification and Determination of Additional Costs. Each of
the Agent and each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower of any event occurring
after the Agreement Date entitling the Agent or such Lender to compensation
under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as
practicable; provided, however, the failure of the Agent or any Lender to give
such notice shall not release the Borrower from any of its obligations
hereunder. The Agent and or such Lender agrees to furnish to the Borrower a
certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by the Agent or
such Lender for compensation under this Section.


                                     -44-
<PAGE>
Determinations by the Agent or any Lender of the effect of any Regulatory Change
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error and provided that such determinations
are made reasonably and in good faith.

SECTION 4.2.  SUSPENSION OF LIBOR LOANS.

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the
determination of any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period:

                  (a)      the Agent determines reasonably and in good faith
         (which determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of
         circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
         means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for
         such Interest Period, or

                  (b)      the Agent reasonably determines (which determination
         shall be conclusive) that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate will not
         adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or
         maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof
and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no
obligation to, and shall not, make additional LIBOR Loans, Continue LIBOR Loans
or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day of
each current Interest Period for each outstanding LIBOR Loan, either repay such
Loan or Convert such Loan into a Base Rate Loan.

SECTION 4.3.  ILLEGALITY.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if it becomes
unlawful for any Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans
hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a
copy to the Agent) and such Lender's obligation to make or Continue, or to
Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such
time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the
provisions of Section 4.5. shall be applicable).

SECTION 4.4.  COMPENSATION.

         The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender,
upon the request of such Lender through the Agent, such amount or amounts as
shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss, cost or expense that
such Lender determines in good faith is attributable to:

                  (a)      any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or
         optional) of a LIBOR Loan, or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such
         Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on
         a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower for any reason
         (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable
         conditions precedent specified in Article V. to be


                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>

         satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan from such Lender on the requested
         date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR
         Loan or to Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such
         Conversion or Continuation,

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the
principal amount so paid, prepaid or Converted or not borrowed for the period
from the date of such payment, prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow or
Convert to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow or Convert, the Interest Period for such Loan
that would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing or
Conversion) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein
plus such Lender's normal administrative charges, if any, associated with such
payment, prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow over (ii) the amount of
interest that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate
per annum equal to LIBOR at such time for an amount comparable to such principal
amount and for a maturity comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by
such Lender). Upon the Borrower's request, any Lender requesting compensation
under this Section shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth the
basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount
thereof. Any such statement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 4.5.  TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.

         If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or
to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to
Section 4.1.(b), 4.2. or 4.3., then such Lender's LIBOR Loans shall be
automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then
current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion
required by Section 4.1.(b) or 4.3., on such earlier date as such Lender may
specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such
Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 4.1., 4.2. or 4.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

                  (a)      to the extent that such Lender's LIBOR Loans have
         been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would
         otherwise be applied to such Lender's LIBOR Loans shall be applied
         instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

                  (b)      all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued
         by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as
         Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would
         otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as Base Rate
         Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 4.1. or 4.3. that gave rise to the Conversion
of such Lender's LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which
such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a
time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lender's
Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the
next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the
extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the
Lenders holding LIBOR


                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>

Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

SECTION 4.6.  CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE.

         Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to designate an
alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Loans affected by the
matters or circumstances described in Sections 3.12., 4.1. or 4.3. to reduce the
liability of the Borrower or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as
such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such
Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation
to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America.

SECTION 4.7.  ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUNDING OF LIBOR LOANS.

         Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article IV.
shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Loans through the
purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate
applicable to such LIBOR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR
Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period;
provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any
manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for
calculation of amounts payable under this Article IV.

in each case, is subject to the further condition precedent that: (a) no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date of the
making of such Loan or date of issuance of such Letter of Credit or would exist

Event). The making of any Loans by the Lenders or the Swingline Lender, or

partnership or other legal entity, duly organized or formed and validly
existing; (b) has all requisite power, and has all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals, necessary to own its assets and carry on
its business as now being or as proposed to be conducted and to consummate the
Transactions, except where the failure to have such requisite power, or have
such governmental licenses, authorizations, consents or approvals could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) is in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or formation and
is qualified to do business in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where
failure to be in good standing or so to qualify could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, all of which such jurisdictions are set forth
on Schedule 6.1.


                                     - 54 -

authorized by all requisite corporate and, if required, stockholder action on
the part of the Borrower and each such Loan Party and (b) will not (i) to the
actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, violate any provision
of Applicable Law, or any order of any Governmental Authority, (ii) violate any
provision of the organizational documents of the Borrower or any other Loan

other Loan Parties (to the extent it is a party thereto) and constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties
enforceable against the Borrower and the other Loan Parties in accordance with
their respective terms, except (a) as the same may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law) and (b) that obligations of a Loan Party resulting solely from being
jointly and severally liable under a Credit Document for the obligations (the
"Primary Obligations") of another Loan Party primarily responsible for the
performance of such Primary Obligations may not be enforceable; provided,
however, the lack of such enforceability does not (i) limit in any way the
enforceability of any of the Primary Obligations and (ii) does not make the
principal remedies afforded by such Credit Document inadequate for the practical
realization of the principal rights, benefits or security provided thereby.

SECTION 6.4.  APPROVALS

         To the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower, no

respective business, property or rights (i) which involve any Credit Document,
any Acquisition Document or any Transaction or (ii) which, if adversely
determined could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no judgment, order, injunction or
other restraint issued or filed which is material to the Borrower or any other
Loan Party, or any of their respective businesses, properties or rights, or
which prohibits or adversely affects any of the Transactions.

all respects with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect
to all Employee Benefit Plans, except for such non-compliance as could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Employee Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified, and each trust
related to such Plan has been determined to be exempt from federal income tax
under Section 501(a) of the Code. The actuarial present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan, as disclosed in the most recent actuarial
report with respect to such Plan, does not exceed the fair market value of the
assets of such Plan, except to such extent as could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. No material liability has been incurred by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of their ERISA Affiliates which
remains unsatisfied for any taxes, penalties or other amount (other than
contributions in the ordinary course) with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
or any Multiemployer Plan, and to the actual knowledge of any Responsible
Officer of the Borrower, no such material liability is expected to be incurred.

         (c)      Neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party has: (i) engaged
in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code; (ii) incurred any liability to the PBGC which remains
outstanding other than the payment of premiums and there are no premium payments
which are due and unpaid; (iii) failed to make a required contribution or
payment to a Multiemployer Plan; or (iv) failed to make a required installment
or other required payment under Section 412 of the Code, which, in the case of
any of the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iv), could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (d)      No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
with respect to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan maintained or contributed to by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

         (e)      Except as set forth on Schedule 6.6. or in any written notice
delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.5., no proceeding, claim,
lawsuit and/or investigation is existing or, to the actual knowledge of any
Responsible Officer of the Borrower, threatened concerning or involving any
Employee Benefit Plan or Multiemployer Plan maintained or contributed to by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party which, if adversely determined could reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 6.9.  TAXES

         Each of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties has filed all federal
income tax returns and all other tax returns and reports, domestic and foreign,
required to be filed by it, or filed appropriate extensions, and has paid all
taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges


                                     - 57 -
<PAGE>

shown to be due and payable by it on such returns or reports, in each case, the
failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. All such returns are true and correct in all material respects.
Each of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties has paid or, in the case of
taxes which are not yet due and payable or are being contested in good faith,
has provided adequate reserves for the payment of, all federal, state and
foreign taxes applicable for all prior fiscal years and for the current fiscal
year to the date hereof, the failure of which taxes to pay could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Loan
Party has received notice of any proposed tax assessment against the Borrower or
any other Loan Party which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.10.  INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

         Neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party is an "investment
company" nor a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

SECTION 6.11.  PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT

         Neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party is a "holding company"
nor an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.

SECTION 6.12.  MATERIAL AGREEMENTS

         Other than this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the Acquisition
Documents and except as set forth on Schedule 6.12. or in any written notice
delivered by the Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders after the date of this
Agreement, neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party is a party to any
agreement or instrument or subject to any corporate restriction that has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.13.  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS

         Except as set forth on Schedule 6.13. or in any written notice

         (b)      The Borrower and each of the other Loan Parties have complied
and are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all Permits and with all
applicable Environmental and Safety Laws.

         (c)      With respect to the Borrower and each of the other Loan
Parties, no notice, notification, demand, request for information, citation,
summons or order has been issued, no

complaint has been filed, no penalty has been assessed and no investigation is
pending or, to the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower,
threatened by any Person with respect to any alleged failure to obtain any
Permits or any violation of any applicable Environmental and Safety Laws, or
with respect to the generation, treatment, storage, recycling, transportation,
discharge or disposal, or any Release or threatened Release, of any Hazardous
Materials.

         (d)      No property or facility now or previously owned or operated by
the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties has been, to the actual knowledge
of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower, or is presently operated by the
Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties in a manner which requires permitting
as a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility for purposes of
RCRA or any analogous state law.

         (f)      No Hazardous Materials have been released by the Borrower or
any of the other Loan Parties into the environment at or from any property or
facility now or previously owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the other
Loan Parties so as to give rise to any present or future liability or obligation
under any applicable Environmental and Safety Laws.

         (g)      Neither the Borrower nor any of the other Loan Parties have
transported or, to the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the
Borrower, arranged for the transportation of any Hazardous Material to any
location which is on the CERCLA National Priorities List (or proposed for such
listing), the CERCLIS list or any comparable state list or which is the subject
of federal, state or local enforcement actions which reasonably could give rise
to liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable
Environmental and Safety Laws.

         (h)      No oral or written notification of a Release of a Hazardous
Material has been made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of the other Loan
Parties and no property or facility now owned or operated by the Borrower or any
of the other Loan Parties is on the CERCLA National Priorities List (or proposed
for such listing), the CERCLIS list or any comparable state list. To the actual
knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower, no property or facility
previously owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is on
the CERCLA National Priorities List (or proposed for such listing), the CERCLIS
list or any comparable state list.

         (i)      No Liens have arisen under or pursuant to any Environmental
and Safety Laws on any property or facility now owned or operated by the

are in process which could subject any such property or facility to such Liens.
To the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower, no Liens
have


                                     - 59 -
<PAGE>

arisen under or pursuant to any Environmental and Safety Laws on any property or
facility previously owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the other Loan
Parties, and no governmental actions have been taken or are in process which

nor any of its Subsidiaries would be required to place any notice or restriction
relating to the presence of Hazardous Materials in any deed to any such property
or facility.

         (j)      To the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the
Borrower, there have been no environmental investigations, studies, audits,
tests, reviews or other analyses of any property or facility now or previously
owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties which have
not been provided to the Agent.

         (k)      To the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the
Borrower, neither the Borrower nor any of the other Loan Parties have assumed,

obligations of any other Person pursuant to Environmental and Safety Laws,
whether by contract, by operation of law or otherwise.

         (l)      To the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the
Borrower, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, there are no other
facts, events or conditions relating to the past or present operations,
properties or facilities of the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties which
reasonably could give rise to liability of the Borrower or any Loan Party under
any Environmental and Safety Laws.

         To the extent any of the foregoing representations in this Section
6.13. relate to a property or facility acquired pursuant to a Purchase
Agreement, such representations are based only on the actual knowledge of any
Responsible Officer of the Borrower.

The aggregate book value of the assets of the FSC does not exceed 5.0% of the
book value of the total consolidated assets of the Borrower and its

all Applicable Laws of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all
Governmental Authorities in respect of the conduct of their respective business
and the ownership of their respective property (including Applicable Laws
relating to environmental standards and controls), except such noncompliance as
could not reasonably be expected to individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has all
Regulatory Permits that are required by its customers for the operation of each
of the Donor Centers as such Donor Centers are currently or anticipated to be

SECTION 6.16.  CAPITALIZATION

the corporate structure and ownership interests of each of the Loan Parties
(other than the Borrower), including the correct legal name of each such Loan
Party, and the shareholders or other Persons holding equity interests in such
Loan Parties and their percentage equity or voting interest. Except as set forth

any capital stock (collectively, "capital stock equivalents") of any Loan Party
(excluding the Borrower) or any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,

agreements or commitments of any nature relating to or exercisable for capital
stock or capital stock equivalents of any Loan Party (excluding the Borrower).

SECTION 6.17.  TITLE TO PROPERTIES

SECTION 6.19.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN ACQUISITION DOCUMENTS

         Each representation and warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower or

Documents are hereby deemed made to and for the benefit of the Agent, the
Lenders and the Swingline Lender as if the same were set forth herein in full.

SECTION 6.20.  PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS, ETC.

the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants
or conditions contained in any contract, agreement, indenture, mortgage, lease
or other binding understanding or arrangement of any such Person, and no
condition exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a default, in each case, that could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.21.  DISCLOSURE

         No representation or warranty of the Borrower or any other Loan Party
made or deemed made in this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any
Acquisition Document, or any other document, certificate or written statement
furnished to the Agent or any Lender by or on behalf


                                     - 61 -
<PAGE>

of any such Person for use in connection with any of the Transactions, excluding
Projections (defined below), contained, as of the date made or deemed made or as
of the date thereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits
or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which the same were made. The financial statements referred to in Section 5.1(a)
(xviii) and Section 5.3(b) fairly present the financial condition of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or the Seller, as the case may be,
and the results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
or the Seller, as the case may be, as of and for the periods covered thereby.
All financial projections concerning the Borrower and its Subsidiaries that have
been or are hereafter made available to the Agent, any Lenders or the Swingline
Lender by the Borrower or any of its representatives (the "Projections") have
been or will be prepared in good faith based upon assumptions the Borrower
believes to be reasonable. There is no material fact known to the Borrower that
has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect and that has not been disclosed
herein or in such other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Agent or any Lender for use in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

SECTION 6.22.  SERAMED DISPOSITION

         All of the Net Proceeds of the Seramed Disposition were either (i) used
by the Borrower to finance a Restricted Payment permitted under Section

to finance Acquisitions or to acquire, construct or improve properties or
capital assets to be used by any of the Loan Parties in the same or similar
line(s) of business as those described in Section 6.18.

SECTION 6.23.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, ETC.

         All representations and warranties made under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents shall be deemed to be made at and as of the Agreement
Date, the Closing Date and at and as of the date of the occurrence of any Credit
Event, except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly
relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such representations and
warranties shall have been true and accurate on and as of such earlier date).
All such representations and warranties shall survive the effectiveness of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents and the making of
the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit.

SECTION 6.24.  REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING ACQUISITIONS

         To the extent any representation or warranty contained in this Article
VI. relates to an Acquisition and the Transactions relating thereto, including
without limitation, the representation contained in Section 6.5.(c) regarding
the Acquisition Historical Financial Statements of a Seller, such representation
or warranty shall be deemed made only on and as of (a) the date such Acquisition
has been consummated and (b) the date of the making of any Loan any of the
proceeds of which are used in whole or in part to finance such Acquisition or
the date of issuance of any Letter of Credit issued in connection with such
Acquisition, in each case with respect to Acquisitions consummated on or after
the date hereof.

                       ARTICLE VII. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         For so long as this Agreement is in effect, unless the Requisite
Lenders (or, if required pursuant to Section 12.6., all of the Lenders) shall
otherwise consent in the manner provided for in Section 12.6., the Borrower
shall, and (as applicable) will cause each of the other Loan Parties to:

SECTION 7.1.  CORPORATE EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; ETC.

         Except as not prohibited by this Agreement: (a) preserve and maintain
its existence, and all of its rights, privileges and franchises, including
without limitation, obtaining and maintaining all necessary FDA approvals and
QPP certification for all of its Donor Centers; (b) comply in all respects with
the requirements of all Applicable Laws, rules, regulations and orders of all
Governmental Authorities; (c) maintain all of its properties used in its
business in sufficient working order and condition so as to permit such Loan
Party to conduct its business; and (d) preserve and enforce its rights
(including rights to indemnification) under any Material Contracts, except in
each case, where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 7.2.  INSURANCE

         Keep insured by financially sound and reputable insurers all property
of a character usually insured by entities engaged in the same or similar
business similarly situated against loss or damage of the kinds and in the
amounts customarily insured against by such businesses and carry such other
insurance as is usually carried by such businesses. Without limiting the
obligations of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties under the foregoing
provisions of this Section, in the event the Borrower or any of the other Loan
Parties shall fail to maintain in full force and effect insurance as required by
the foregoing provisions of this Section or any of the other Credit Documents,
then the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may upon notice to the Borrower or
such other Loan Party, but shall have no obligation to, procure insurance
covering the interests of the Agent and the Lenders in such amounts and against
such risks as the Agent shall deem appropriate, and the Borrower shall reimburse
the Agent in respect of any premiums paid by the Agent as provided in Section
12.2.

SECTION 7.3.  OBLIGATIONS AND TAXES

         Pay its Indebtedness and other obligations in accordance with their
terms and pay and discharge promptly all taxes, assessments and governmental
charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or in respect of
its property, and in any event before the same shall become delinquent or in
default, as well as all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies or
otherwise which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon such properties or
any part thereof which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that such payment and discharge shall not be required
so long as the validity or amount thereof shall be contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings which effectively stay the execution of any such Lien
and the Borrower shall (or shall cause the applicable Loan Party to) set aside
on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP with respect thereto.


                                     - 63 -
<PAGE>

SECTION 7.4.  MAINTAINING RECORDS; ACCESS TO PROPERTIES AND INSPECTIONS

         Maintain all financial records in accordance with GAAP and permit any
representatives designated by the Agent or any Lender upon reasonable notice to
visit and inspect the properties of the Borrower or any of the other Loan
Parties (such visits and inspections to be at the sole cost and expense of the
Agent or such Lender, so long as an Event of Default is not existing) and to
inspect their financial and business records (except records and documents
subject to the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine) and to
make extracts therefrom and copies thereof, all at reasonable times and in a
manner so as not to unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Borrower or the
other Loan Parties and as often as reasonably requested, and permit the Agent or
any Lender or any representatives designated by the Agent or any Lender upon
reasonable notice to discuss the affairs, finances and condition of the Borrower
or any of the other Loan Parties with the officers thereof and independent
accountants therefor; provided, however, that (i) any representatives designated
by the Agent or any Lender shall be in the business of acting as crisis managers
or business consultants and shall be bound by the same or similar internal
policies with regard to confidential information as is the Agent or such Lender
and (ii) the Agent or any Lender or any representatives designated by the Agent
or any Lender shall not discuss the affairs, finances and condition of the
Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties with the Borrower's independent
accountants unless and until the Agent or such Lender determines in its
reasonable discretion that discussions directly with the Borrower or the
officers of the Borrower have failed to satisfy the inquiries of the Agent or
such Lender or its representatives. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Borrower shall, and shall cause each of the other Loan Parties to, keep
complete, accurate and detailed financial records with respect to all amounts of
all Loans made available to any of the Subsidiaries by way of loans.

SECTION 7.5.  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS

         For the purposes of protecting the Agent's security interest in the
Collateral and preserving the Borrower's ability to satisfy its Obligations:

         (a)      Comply with all Environmental and Safety Laws applicable to it
or any of its property or facilities in all material respects.

         (b)      Keep its properties and facilities free from any Liens arising
under any Environmental and Safety Laws which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c)      Respond promptly to any Release or threatened Release of any
Hazardous Materials in a manner which complies in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental and Safety Laws and mitigates any associated risk to
human health or the environment to the maximum extent commercially practicable.

         (d)      If the Agent at any time has a reasonable basis to believe
that any property or facility owned or operated by the Borrower or any other
Loan Party has been or may be either (i) operated in violation of any applicable
Environmental and Safety Laws; (ii) contaminated with any Hazardous Materials at
or above levels requiring removal or remedial action under applicable
Environmental and Safety Laws; or (iii) subject to any government-imposed


                                     - 64 -
<PAGE>

obligation to conduct any environmental investigation or clean-up, any of which,
in the good faith judgment of the Agent may impair in any material respect the
value of the Collateral or the ability of the Borrower or any of the other Loan
Parties to satisfy any of their respective Obligations, the Borrower shall, upon
the written request of the Agent, at the Borrower's sole cost and expense,
conduct such investigation or study, through retention of a consulting firm
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, as is necessary in the good faith judgment
of the Agent to demonstrate that no such impairment could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 7.6.  ADDITIONAL SECURITY

         If and to the extent requested by the Agent or the Requisite Lenders
from time to time, after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default
or Event of Default, execute and deliver such additional documents and take such
other action as may be necessary or desirable in the reasonable opinion of the
Agent or the Requisite Lenders, in order to assure and confirm that all
Obligations are secured in a manner acceptable to the Agent or the Requisite
Lenders by a first priority Lien on substantially all present and future assets
of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties (other than any Foreign Subsidiary)
subject only to Permitted Liens.

SECTION 7.7.  USE OF PROCEEDS; LETTERS OF CREDIT.

         Use the proceeds of all Loans and all Letters of Credit for working
capital, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes, including
permitted stock repurchases and Acquisitions made in compliance with this
Agreement, to the extent applicable. The Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any Subsidiary or other Loan Party to, use any part of such proceeds or
Letters of Credit to purchase or carry, or to reduce or retire or refinance any
credit incurred to purchase or carry, any Margin Stock or to extend credit to
others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such Margin Stock.

SECTION 7.8.  ADDITIONAL MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES.

         Within 60 calendar days of any Person becoming a Subsidiary after the
Agreement Date, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent each of the items that
would be required to be delivered under Section 5.3. if such Subsidiary were a
New Subsidiary being acquired pursuant to an Acquisition (but only to the extent
such items are not otherwise required to be delivered to the Agent under such
Section). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, (a) no Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to execute and deliver a
Guaranty and (b) a Loan Party shall only be obligated to pledge under the Pledge
Agreement the maximum amount of the total combined voting power of all classes
of stock entitled to vote of its respective Foreign Subsidiaries that it may so
pledge without such Foreign Subsidiary being deemed to be holding United States
property by virtue of 26 C.F.R. ss.1.956-2(c)(2).

SECTION 7.9.  REAL PROPERTY DELIVERIES.

         Within 60 calendar days of any date on which the ratio of Consolidated
Debt to EBITDA (calculated in accordance with Section 1.3.) shall equal or
exceed 1.5 to 1.0, the Borrower shall


                                     - 65 -
<PAGE>

deliver to the Agent each of the following items with respect to any real
property interests of any of the Loan Parties as the Agent and the Lenders shall
designate in their reasonable discretion:

         (a)      With respect to any real property interests in which such Loan
Party holds fee simple title, each of the following:

                  (i)      To the extent not previously delivered, a Security
         Deed encumbering such real property;

                  (ii)     An ALTA 1992 Form mortgagee's Policy of Title
         Insurance (without any creditor's rights exclusion and without any
         mandatory arbitration provision) or other form acceptable to the Agent,
         in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders with respect to
         such property, including endorsements with respect to such items of
         coverage as the Agent may reasonably request and which endorsements are
         available, issued by a title insurance company acceptable to the Agent
         and with coinsurance or reinsurance (with direct access agreements)
         with title insurance companies acceptable to the Agent, showing the fee
         simple title to the land and improvements described in such Security
         Deed as vested in the applicable Loan Party, and insuring that the Lien
         granted by such Security Deed is a valid first priority Lien against
         said property, subject only to such restrictions, encumbrances,
         easements and reservations as are acceptable to the Agent. The amount
         of coverage under such policy must be at least equal to the fair market
         value of such property as indicated in the Appraisal required by
         subclause (viii) below;

                  (iii)    UCC, tax, judgment and lien search reports with
         respect to the Borrower (or Subsidiary if the property is owned by a
         Subsidiary) and such property in all necessary or appropriate
         jurisdictions indicating that there are no Liens of record on such
         property or any of the Collateral relating thereto other than Permitted
         Liens:

                  (iv)     A current or currently certified survey of such real

ERISA Event) and the Insufficiency of any and all other Plans (determined as of
the date of occurrence of such ERISA Event) of the Borrower or any other Loan
Party with respect to which an ERISA Event shall have occurred (or the liability
of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or its ERISA Affiliates related to such
ERISA Event) exceeds 5.0% of Consolidated Tangible Assets (as determined by
reference to the most recently prepared audited financial statements of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries); or (b) the Borrower or any other
Loan Party or any of its ERISA Affiliates shall have been notified by a
Multiemployer Plan that it has incurred withdrawal liability to such
Multiemployer Plan and the imposition of such liability is reasonably likely to
be incurred in an amount that, when aggregated with all other amounts required
to be paid to Multiemployer Plans by the Borrower or any other Loan Party and
its ERISA Affiliates as withdrawal liability (determined as of the date of such
notification indemnification), requires payments exceeding 5.0% of Consolidated
Tangible Assets (as determined by reference to the most recently prepared
audited financial statements of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries)

amount exceeding 5.0% of Consolidated Tangible Assets (as determined by
reference to the most recently prepared audited financial statements of the

Borrower.

         (j)      Failure of Security Interest. The Agent shall cease to have a

         are expressly waived by the Borrower and (II) terminate the Commitments
         and the obligation of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and the
         obligation of the Agent to


                                      -79-
<PAGE>

         issue Letters of Credit hereunder. If the Agent has exercised any of
         the rights provided under the preceding sentence, the Swingline Lender

or the solvency of any party bound for its payment, to take possession of all or
any portion of the Collateral and/or the business operations of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries and to exercise such power as the court shall confer upon such
receiver.

                                      -80-
<PAGE>

                  (e)      payments of principal of Revolving Loans and

         above, shall be paid to the Borrower or whomever else may be legally
         entitled thereto.

SECTION 10.5.  COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

         (a)      As collateral security for the prompt payment in full when due
of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, the Borrower hereby pledges and grants to
the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders as provided herein, a
security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the
Collateral Account and the balances from time to time in the Collateral Account
(including the investments and reinvestments therein provided for below). The
balances from time to time in the Collateral Account shall not constitute
payment of any Letter of Credit Liabilities until applied by the Agent as
provided herein. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
funds held in the Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as
provided in this Section and in Section 2.11.

         (b)      Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested
and reinvested by the Agent in such Cash Equivalents as the Agent shall
determine in its sole discretion. All such investments and reinvestments shall
be held in the name of and be under the sole dominion and control of the Agent
and all interest and other earnings in respect of such investments and
reinvestments shall be deposited into the Collateral Account until withdrawn as
provided in this Section (including the immediately following subsection (d)),
in Section 2.11. or in any other applicable provision of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document. The Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody
and preservation of any funds held in the Collateral Account and shall be deemed
to have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially
equivalent to that which the Agent accords its own funds, it being understood
that the Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps
to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any funds held in the
Collateral Account.

         (c)      If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Agent may (and, if instructed by the Requisite Lenders, shall) in its (or
their) discretion at any time and from time to time elect to liquidate any such
investments and reinvestments and credit the proceeds thereof to the Collateral
Account and apply or cause to be applied such proceeds and any other balances


                                      -81-
<PAGE>

in the Collateral Account to the payment of any of the Letter of Credit
Liabilities due and payable.

         (d)      So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Agent shall, from time to time, at the written request of the
Borrower, deliver to the Borrower within 5 days of receipt of such request,
against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever,
such of the balances in the Collateral Account as exceed the aggregate amount of
Letter of Credit Liabilities at such time, including any interest and other
earnings on investments in respect of the Collateral Account. When all of the
Obligations shall have been paid in full and no Letters of Credit remain
outstanding, the Agent shall promptly deliver to the Borrower, against receipt
but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, the balances
remaining in the Collateral Account.

SECTION 10.6.  PERFORMANCE BY AGENT.

         If the Borrower shall fail to perform any covenant, duty or agreement
contained in any of the Credit Documents, the Agent may perform or attempt to
perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrower after the
expiration of any cure or grace periods set forth herein. In such event, the
Borrower shall, at the request of the Agent, promptly pay any amount reasonably
expended by the Agent in such performance or attempted performance to the Agent,
together with interest thereon at the applicable Post-Default Rate from the date
of such expenditure until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Agent
nor any Lender shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the
performance of any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other
Credit Document.

SECTION 10.7.  RIGHTS CUMULATIVE.

         The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under this
Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under
Applicable Law. In exercising their respective rights and remedies the Agent and
the Lenders may be selective and no failure or delay by the Agent or any of the
Lenders in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further
exercise or the exercise of any other power or right.

                              ARTICLE XI. THE AGENT

SECTION 11.1.  AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.

         Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as contractual representative on such Lender's behalf and to exercise
such powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as are
specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Nothing herein shall be
construed to deem the Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender nor to impose
on the Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for
herein. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender confirms and agrees that
the Agent has no fiduciary obligations to such Lender under this Agreement, any
other Credit Document or otherwise. At the request of a


                                      -82-
<PAGE>

Lender, the Agent will forward to such Lender copies or, where appropriate,
originals of the documents delivered to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Credit Documents. The Agent will also furnish to any Lender, upon the
request of such Lender, a copy of any certificate or notice furnished to the
Agent by the Borrower, any Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower,
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document not already required to
be delivered to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such
other Credit Document. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the
Credit Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of
any of the Obligations), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting)
upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if
explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the
Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Agent shall not be required to take any action which
exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement
or any other Credit Document or Applicable Law. Not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Agent shall not exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders
may have under any Credit Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event
of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have so directed the Agent to exercise
such right or remedy.

SECTION 11.2.  AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other
Credit Documents, neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents,
employees or counsel shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement,
except to the extent found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or their own gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent
receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such
payee and in form satisfactory to the Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel
(including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any Loan Party),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no
warranty or representation to any Lender or any other Person and shall not be
responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statements, warranties or
representations made by any Person in or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Credit Document; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of any of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the
satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Credit
Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons or inspect the property,
books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (e) shall not be
responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or
any Collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any Lien in
favor of the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in any such Collateral; and (f)
shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document by acting upon any


                                      -83-
<PAGE>

notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telephone or telecopy) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by
the proper party or parties.

SECTION 11.3.  NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.

         The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has received notice
from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with
reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default." If any Lender (excluding the Agent in its
capacity as a Lender) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall
promptly send to the Agent such a "notice of default." Further, if the Agent
receives such a "notice of default", the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof
to the Lenders.

SECTION 11.4.  BANK OF AMERICA AS LENDER.

         Bank of America, as a Lender, shall have the same rights and powers
under this Agreement and any other Credit Document as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Bank of America
in each case in its individual capacity. Bank of America and its affiliates may
each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in,
lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor
to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other
Loan Party or any other affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and
without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders. Further, the Agent
and any affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for
services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to
account for the same to the other Lenders.

SECTION 11.5.  APPROVALS OF LENDERS.

         All communications from the Agent to any Lender requesting such
Lender's determination, consent, approval or disapproval (a) shall be given in
the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a
description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, approval,
consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where
information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall
otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved, (c) shall include, if
reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to
such Lender, written materials provided to the Agent by the Borrower in respect
of the matter or issue to be resolved, and (d) shall include the Agent's
recommended course of action or determination in respect thereof. Each Lender
shall reply promptly, but in any event within 10 Business Days (or such lesser
period as may be required under the Credit Documents for the Agent to respond).
Unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Agent that it consents to the
recommendation or determination of the Agent within the applicable time period
for reply, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively rejected or not
consented to such recommendation or determination.


                                      -84-

SECTION 11.6.  LENDER CREDIT DECISION, ETC.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Agent,
BAS, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
counsel, attorneys-in-fact or other affiliates has made any representations or
warranties as to the financial condition, operations, creditworthiness, solvency
or other information concerning the business or affairs of the Borrower, any
other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or other Person to such Lender and that no act
by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by
the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, BAS, any other Lender or counsel to the Agent,
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based
on the financial statements of the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or any other
Affiliate thereof, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence
of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the Loan Parties, the Subsidiaries
and other Persons, its review of the Credit Documents, the legal opinions
required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the
transaction contemplated hereby. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, BAS, any other Lender or
counsel to the Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking
or not taking action under the Credit Documents. Except for notices, reports and
other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents,
the Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any
credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other
Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the
Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
other Affiliates. Each Lender acknowledges that the Agent's legal counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting
as counsel to the Agent and is not acting as counsel to such Lender.

SECTION 11.7.  INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT.

         Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so)
pro rata in accordance with such Lender's respective Commitment Percentage, from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Agent (in its capacity as Agent but not as a Lender) in any way
relating to or arising out of the Credit Documents, any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under the Credit
Documents (collectively, "Indemnifiable Amounts"); provided, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the
extent found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees
to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable


                                      -85-
<PAGE>

counsel fees of the counsel(s) of the Agent's own choosing) incurred by the
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, administration, or
enforcement of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities
of the parties under, the Credit Documents, any suit or action brought by the
Agent to enforce the terms of the Credit Documents and/or collect any
Obligations, any "lender liability" suit or claim brought against the Agent
and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Agent and/or the
Lenders arising under any Environmental and Safety Laws, to the extent that the
Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. The agreements in
this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, the expiration of all
Letters of Credit and the termination of this Agreement. If the Borrower shall
reimburse the Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender
to the Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section,
the Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender
making any such payment.

SECTION 11.8.  COLLATERAL MATTERS.

         (a)      The Agent is authorized on behalf of all of the Lenders,
without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender, from
time to time prior to an Event of Default, to take any action with respect to
any Collateral or Credit Documents which may be necessary to perfect and
maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to any of the
Credit Documents.

         (b)      The Lenders hereby authorize the Agent, at its option and in
its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any
Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction
of all of the Obligations at any time arising under or in respect of this
Agreement or the Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if the Borrower
certifies to the Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with
Section 9.9. (and the Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate,
without further inquiry); (iii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with,
the express terms of the applicable Credit Document; or (iv) if approved,
authorized or ratified in writing by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request
by the Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's
authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this
Section.

         (c)      Upon any sale and transfer of Collateral which is expressly
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or consented to in writing by
the Requisite Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and upon at least
five Business Days' prior written request by the Borrower, the Agent shall (and
is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as
may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Agent for
the benefit of the Lenders herein or pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that
was sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i) the Agent shall not be
required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's opinion,
would expose the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty;
and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the
Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any Loan Party
in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall
continue to constitute part of the Collateral. In the event of any sale or
transfer of


                                      -86-
<PAGE>

Collateral, or any foreclosure with respect to any of the Collateral, the Agent
shall be authorized to deduct all of the expenses reasonably incurred by the
Agent from the proceeds of any such sale, transfer or foreclosure.

         (d)      The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Lenders
or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or is cared for, protected or insured or that the
Liens granted to the Agent herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or
sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are
entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise or to continue exercising at
all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of
the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Agent in this
Section or in any of the Credit Documents, it being understood and agreed that
in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, the
Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion,
given the Agent's own interest in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that
the Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to the Lenders, except for
its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 11.9.  SUCCESSOR AGENT.

         The Agent may resign at any time as Agent under the Credit Documents by
giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, be subject to the Borrower's approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that Borrower
shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender as a successor
Agent). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Requisite
Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
resigning Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the resigning Agent may,
on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if
any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank
having total combined assets of at least $50,000,000,000. If no successor Agent
has accepted appointment by the date which is 30 days following a resigning
Agent's notice of resignation, the resignation shall nevertheless thereupon
become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the agent
until such time, if any, as a successor Agent is appointed as provided for
above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor
Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent, and the
resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the
Credit Documents. After any resigning Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article XI. shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under the Credit
Documents.

SECTION 11.10.  DOCUMENTATION AGENT.

         The Documentation Agent in such capacity assumes no responsibility or
obligation hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement
or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the
Lenders. The title of "Documentation Agent" is solely honorific and implies no
fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Documentation Agent, in its capacity
as such, to the Agent, the Borrower or any Lender and the


                                      -87-
<PAGE>

use of such title does not impose on the Documentation Agent any duties or
obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Documentation
Agent to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.

faith to have been given by a Person authorized to deliver such notice or for
otherwise acting in good faith under hereunder.

         The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all of the
Agent's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the preparation, negotiation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or

permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held, and other
Indebtedness at any time owing, by the Agent or such Lender to or for the credit
or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the Obligations,
irrespective of whether or not any demand shall have been made. Each of the
Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower of any
such set-off and application simultaneously therewith, provided that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of the Agent and the Lenders under this Section are in
addition to any other rights and remedies (including without limitation, other
rights of set-off) which the Agent or any Lender may have.

SECTION 12.4.  ARBITRATION.

         ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY

                                      -90-
<PAGE>

WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION; FURTHER, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL

HELP RIGHTS, FORECLOSE UPON SUCH PROPERTY, OR OBTAIN SUCH PROVISIONAL OR
ANCILLARY REMEDIES BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE PENDENCY OF ANY ARBITRATION
PROCEEDING BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. NEITHER THE EXERCISE OF SELF HELP
REMEDIES NOR THE INSTITUTION OR MAINTENANCE OF AN ACTION FOR FORECLOSURE OR
PROVISIONAL OR ANCILLARY REMEDIES SHALL CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT OF ANY
PARTY, INCLUDING THE CLAIMANT IN ANY SUCH ACTION, TO ARBITRATE THE MERITS OF THE
CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM OCCASIONING RESORT TO SUCH REMEDIES.

SECTION 12.5.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all
Lenders.

         (b)      Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Loans at, to or for the
account of, any of its branch offices or the office of an affiliate of such
Lender except to the extent such transfer would result in increased costs to the
Borrower.

         (c)      Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
financial institutions or other entities (each a "Participant") participating
interests in its Commitment or the Obligations owing to such Lender; provided,
however, any such participating interest must be for a constant and not a
varying percentage interest. No Participant shall have any rights or benefits
under this Agreement or any other Credit Document. In the event of any such
grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender
shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and
the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a
participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right and responsibility


                                      -91-
<PAGE>

to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without
limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement; provided, however, such Lender may agree with the
Participant that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to
(i) increase, or extend the term or extend the time or waive any requirement for
the reduction or termination of, such Lender's Commitment, (ii) extend the date
fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or portions
thereof owing to such Lender, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of
principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon, (v) any
release of all or substantially all of the Collateral, or (vi) any release of
any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty. An assignment or other
transfer which is not permitted by subsection (d) below shall be given effect
for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest
granted in accordance with this subsection (c). The selling Lender shall notify
the Agent and the Borrower of the sale of any participation hereunder and the
terms thereof.

         (d)      Any Lender may with the prior written consent of the Agent and
the Borrower (which consent, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld)
assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each an "Assignee") all or a portion
of such Lender's Commitment and its other rights, obligations and rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes; provided, however, (i) no such
consent by the Borrower shall be required in any case if a Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or with respect to an assignment
to a CLO if the assigning Lender retains the sole right to approve any
amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or to any provision of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document (except that the CLO may require such
Lender to obtain its consent for any such amendment, modification, waiver or
consent described in clauses (i) through (viii), inclusive, of Section 12.6.
that affects such CLO); (ii) no such consent by the Borrower shall be required
in the case of any assignment to another Lender or any affiliate of such Lender
or another Lender unless after giving effect to such assignment, the Assignee
will hold 40% or more of the aggregate amount of all Lenders' Commitments; (iii)
any partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 and
after giving effect to such assignment the assigning Lender retains a
Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, holds Notes having an
aggregate outstanding principal balance, of at least $5,000,000; and (iv) each
such assignment shall be effected by means of an Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such
Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price
agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be
deemed to be a Lender party to this Agreement as of the effective date of the
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and shall have all the rights and
obligations of a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this subsection (d), the transferor Lender, the Agent and the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the
Assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate. In connection with any such
assignment (including without limitation, an assignment from one Lender to
another Lender), the transferor Lender shall pay to the Agent an administrative
fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500.

         (e)      The Agent shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
Commitment of each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The Agent shall
give each Lender and the Borrower notice of the assignment by any Lender of its
rights as contemplated by this Section. The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register and copies of each
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice to the Agent. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender, together with each Note
subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement has been completed and if the Agent receives the processing and
recording fee described in subsection (d) above, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.

         (f)      In addition to the assignments and participations permitted
under the foregoing provisions of this Section, any Lender may assign and pledge
all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued
by such Federal Reserve Bank, and such Loans and Notes shall be fully
transferable as provided therein. No such assignment shall release the assigning
Lender from its obligations hereunder.

         (g)      A Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrower,
any other Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries in the possession
of such Lender from time to time to Assignees and Participants (including
prospective Assignees and Participants), subject to compliance with Section
12.8.

         (h)      Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder
to the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries.

         (i)      Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of
the Borrower and the Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any
manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or
qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the
Securities Act or any other securities laws United States of America or of any
other jurisdiction.

SECTION 12.6.  AMENDMENTS.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any consent
or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or in any Credit Document to
be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Agreement or of any
other Credit Document may be amended, and the performance or observance by the
Borrower or any Loan Party or Subsidiary of any terms of this Agreement or such
other Credit Document or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may
be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite
Lenders


                                      -93-
<PAGE>

(and, in the case of an amendment to any Credit Document, the written consent of
the Borrower). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing, and signed by all of the Lenders (or the Agent at the
written direction of the Lenders), do any of the following: (i) increase the
Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional obligations,
except for any increase in the Commitments effectuated pursuant to Section
2.12.; (ii) reduce the principal of, or interest rates that have accrued or that
will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or other
Obligations; (iii) reduce the amount of any Fees payable hereunder; (iv)
postpone any date fixed for any payment of any principal of, interest on, or
Fees with respect to, any Loans or any other Obligations; (v) change the
Commitment Percentages, except for any change in the Commitment Percentages
resulting from any increase of the Commitments effectuated pursuant to Section
2.12.; (vi) amend Section 2.12., this Section or amend the definitions of the
terms used in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents insofar as such
definitions affect the substance of this Section; (vii) modify the definition of
the term "Requisite Lenders" or modify in any other manner the number or
percentage of the Lenders required to make any determinations or waive any
rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof; and (viii) release any
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty. Any amendment, waiver or
consent relating to Section 2.13. or the obligations of Swingline Lender under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, in addition to Lenders required
hereinabove to take such action, require the written consent of Swingline
Lender. Further, no amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by
the Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action,
shall affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any of
the other Credit Documents. Further, no Collateral shall be released or disposed
of by the Agent unless all of the Lenders so direct the Agent or unless released
or disposed of as permitted by, and in accordance with, Section 11.8. No waiver
shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any
right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein. No
course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be
prejudicial thereto. Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in
any other Credit Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall
entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

SECTION 12.7.  NONLIABILITY OF AGENT AND LENDERS.

         The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders
and the Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender.
Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to
the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Credit
Documents, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties hereto,
shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Agent or any Lender to
any Lender, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party. Neither the
Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or
inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's
business or operations.

SECTION 12.8.  CONFIDENTIALITY.

         The Agent and the Lenders shall hold all non-public, proprietary or
confidential information (which has been identified as such by the Borrower)
obtained pursuant to the


                                      -94-
<PAGE>

requirements of this Agreement in accordance with their customary procedures for
handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and
sound banking practices; provided, however, the Agent and the Lenders may make
disclosure of any such information to such of their examiners, affiliates,
outside auditors, counsel, consultants, appraisers and other professional
advisors as may be reasonably necessary in connection with this Agreement or as
reasonably required by any proposed Assignee or any proposed Participant in
connection with the contemplated transfer of any Note or participation therein
or as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative
thereof or in connection with the enforcement hereof or of any Loan Document or
related document or pursuant to legal process or with respect to any litigation
between or among the Borrower, the Agent, any of the Lenders or the Swingline
Lender; provided, however, that, as a condition to receipt of any such
information, each such affiliate, auditor, counsel, consultant, appraiser,
professional advisor, proposed Assignee or Participant shall agree in writing to
treat all such information as confidential; and provided, further, that prior to
any such disclosure to any unrelated entity outside the ordinary course of
business or pursuant to legal process, the party making such disclosure shall
give notice of such disclosure to the Borrower and cooperate with the Borrower
in any efforts to limit or restrict such disclosure. In no event shall the
Agent, any Lender or the Swingline Lender be obligated or required to return any
materials furnished to it by the Borrower. The foregoing provisions shall not
apply to the Agent, any Lender or the Swingline Lender with respect to
information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public (other than
through such Person), (b) is already in the possession of such Person on a
nonconfidential basis, or (c) comes into the possession of such Person in a
manner not known to such Person to involve a breach of a duty of confidentiality
owing to the Borrower.

SECTION 12.9.  INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Borrower shall and hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Agent,
BAS, any affiliate of the Agent and each of the Lenders and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, agents, employees and counsel (each referred
to herein as an "Indemnified Party") for, and hold Indemnified Party harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims (including Environmental
Claims), damages or expenses incurred by any of them arising out of or by reason
of any investigation or litigation or other proceedings (including any
threatened investigation or litigation or other proceedings) relating to the
extensions of credit hereunder or any actual or proposed use by the Borrower or
any Loan Party of the proceeds of any of the extensions of credit hereunder or
the past, present or future business activities of the Borrower or any Loan
Party including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation or litigation or
other proceedings (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages
or expenses that are determined pursuant to a final, non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or by binding arbitration, as applicable, to
have resulted solely from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
of such Indemnified Party).

SECTION 12.10.  SURVIVAL.

         Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, or of the other
Credit Documents, the indemnities to which the Agent and the Lenders are
entitled under the provisions of Sections 11.7., 12.2. and 12.9. and any other
provision of this Agreement and the other Credit


                                      -95-
<PAGE>

Documents, and the arbitration provisions contained in Section 12.4., shall
continue in full force and effect and shall protect the protect the Agent, the
Lenders and the Swingline Lender against events arising after such termination
as well as before.

SECTION 12.11.  SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.

         Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 12.12.  GOVERNING LAW.

         THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED, AND TO BE
FULLY PERFORMED, IN SUCH STATE.

         This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may
be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, but all of which counterparts together shall constitute but
one and the same instrument.

SECTION 12.14.  OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO LOAN PARTIES.

         The obligations of the Borrower to direct or prohibit the taking of
certain actions by the other Loan Parties as specified herein shall be absolute
and not subject to any defense the Borrower may have that the Borrower does not
control such Loan Parties.

SECTION 12.15.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

         This Agreement, the Notes, and the other Credit Documents referred to
herein, together with any letter agreement between the Agent, BAS, any Lender or
the Swingline Lender regarding Fees and any letter agreement between the
Swingline Lender and the Borrower regarding interest rates applicable to
Swingline Loans, embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersede any and all prior commitments, agreements, representations, and
understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof
and may not be contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or
subsequent oral agreements or discussions of the parties hereto. There are no
oral agreements among the parties hereto.

SECTION 12.16.  CONSTRUCTION.

         The Agent, the Borrower and each Lender acknowledge that each of them

opportunity to review this Agreement and the other Credit Documents with its
legal counsel and that this Agreement and
