            that contract year shall increase to 7.5%, and the Company shall pay
            the Reinsurer the additional amount due on January 31 of the year of
            the calculation for the applicable contract year, plus 4.0% interest
            from the original payment due dates.

      C.    If this Contract is not commuted within 25 months after the end of
            any contract year, the Reinsurer's expense allowance percentage for
            that contract year shall increase to 11.5%, and the Company shall
