terms generally ranging from six to twelve months following the consummation of the Acquisition (with an option to extend the term with respect to certain Transition Services for an additional period not to exceed six months). Many of the Transition
Services, however, may not be extended beyond their applicable term. International Paper may discontinue the provision of a service prior to the expiration of the applicable term if we fail to make payments owed or if we materially breach the
agreement, but the discontinuation may only be for the services related to the failure to pay or breach. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">3. <U>Supply Agreement</U> </FONT></P> <P
