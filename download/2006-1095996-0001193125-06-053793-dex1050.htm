Lender to identify Borrower, and, if Borrower is not an individual, Lender will ask for Borrower&#146;s name, taxpayer identification number, business address, and other information that will allow Lender to identify Borrower. Lender may also ask,

rights to enforce any remedy which Lender may have against the other Borrower and any rights to participate in any collateral or any other assets of the other Borrower. Except as expressly provided in the Contribution Agreement, each Borrower agrees

and that each Borrower may therefore incur partially or totally nonreimbursable liability hereunder. Nevertheless, each Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers the Lender, its respective successors, endorsees and assigns, to exercise in its or their
sole discretion, any rights and remedies, or any combination thereof, which may then be available, it being the purpose and intent of each Borrower that the obligations hereunder shall be absolute, continuing, independent and unconditional under any
and all circumstances. Each Borrower understands that: (i)&nbsp;the applicable jurisdictions in which the Property may be located may prohibit a deficiency judgment against a borrower after a non-judicial foreclosure; (ii)&nbsp;such Borrower&#146;s
subrogation rights may be destroyed by a non-judicial foreclosure under a Deed of Trust because such Borrower may not be able to pursue the other Borrower for a deficiency judgment; and (iii)&nbsp;a lender may be estopped from pursuing a guarantor
for a deficiency judgment after a non-judicial foreclosure (on the theory that a guarantor should be exonerated if a lender elects a remedy that eliminates that guarantor&#146;s subrogation rights) absent an explicit waiver. Without limitation on
the generality of the other waivers contained in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby waives (1)&nbsp;any suretyship or guarantor defense that might otherwise be available to such Borrower as a result of Lender&#146;s pursuit of a non-judicial
foreclosure, and (2)&nbsp;all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the creditor, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a Joint and Several Obligation, has
destroyed the guarantor&#146;s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of any applicable law or otherwise. In addition, each Borrower waives all rights and defenses that such Borrower may have because the Joint
and Several Obligations are secured by real property. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
