security interest granted hereunder in the Collateral shall be junior, and
otherwise subject and subordinate in all respects, to the security interest
granted in the Collateral under the Senior Mortgage):

            (a) the Engines, each of which Engines has 750 or more rated takeoff
      horsepower or the equivalent of such horsepower (as more particularly
      described in each Mortgage Supplement executed and delivered in connection
      herewith), as the same is now and will hereafter be constituted, whether
      now owned or hereafter acquired, and whether or not any such Engine from
      time to time is installed on an airframe, together with (a) all Parts of
      whatever nature, which are from time to time included within the

            (b) all warranty rights with respect to the Engines or any Part
      thereof that the Company may have to the extent that such warranty rights
      are assignable (the "Warranties") (it being understood that the Company
      has no obligation to obtain an assignment or consent or to take any
      further action with respect to the security interest granted pursuant to
      this clause (other than to include such Collateral in any UCC financing
      statements and continuation statements) notwithstanding any obligation of
      the Company in any Operative Document (including the last paragraph of
      this Section 2.01) to execute and deliver further instruments and
      documents or provide other further assurances, except that, if an Event of
      Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company will take
      reasonable action requested by the Security Trustee for the assignment of
      material Warranties with respect to an Engine to any person acquiring such
      Engine pursuant to Article 4); in each case together with all rights,
      powers, privileges, options and other benefits of the Company thereunder
      with respect to the Engines, including, without limitation, the right to
      make claims thereunder, and to do any and all other things which the
      Company is or may be entitled to do thereunder;

            (c) each assigned Lease (to the extent assigned under any Lease
      assignment), and including, without limitation, all rents or other
      payments of any kind made under such assigned Lease, all collateral
      security or credit support with respect to such assigned Lease (in the
      nature of a guarantee, letter of credit, credit insurance, Lien on or
      security interest in any property or otherwise) for the obligations of the
      lessee thereunder (if any), and all rights of the Company to execute any
      election or option or to give any notice, consent, waiver, or approval
      under or with respect to any thereof or to accept any surrender of any
      Engine or any part thereof as well as any rights, powers or

      remedies on the part of the Company, whether arising under such assigned
      Lease or by statute or at law or in equity, or otherwise, arising out of
      any default under such assigned Lease (it being understood that, so long
      as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company
      shall retain all rights as lessor under such Lease, including to receive
      all such payments thereunder, to hold, dispose of, or relinquish any such
      collateral or credit support and to take or refrain from taking all
      actions thereunder) (to the extent assigned under such Lease assignment);

            (d) all proceeds with respect to the requisition of title to the
      Engines or any part thereof, and all insurance proceeds with respect to
      the Engines or any part thereof, but excluding any insurance maintained by
      the Company and not required under Section 3.05;

            (e) all Eligible Accounts; all cash, Permitted Investments and other
      financial assets held therein by the Security Trustee or an Eligible
      Institution or otherwise paid or deposited to or with the Security Trustee
      or an Eligible Institution and held or required to be held by the Security
      Trustee or an Eligible Institution hereunder; and all security
      entitlements (as defined in Article 8 of the New York UCC) with respect
      thereto; and

            (f) all proceeds of the foregoing;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.01, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (i) the Company shall have the right, to the exclusion of the
Security Trustee, to quiet enjoyment of the Engines and the other Collateral,
and peaceably and quietly, without hindrance or molestation, to possess, use,
retain and control the Engines and the other Collateral, and (ii) the Company
shall have the right, to the exclusion of the Security Trustee, with respect to
the Warranties, to exercise in the Company's name all rights and powers as the
beneficiary of the Warranties and to retain any recovery or benefit resulting
from the enforcement of any warranty or indemnity under the Warranties;

            TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Collateral unto the Security Trustee, its
successors and assigns, forever, upon the terms herein set forth, for the
benefit, security and protection of the Security Trustee, and for the uses and
purposes and subject to the terms and provisions set forth in this Mortgage.

            It is expressly agreed that anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall remain liable under any assigned
Lease and the Warranties to perform all of the obligations assumed by it
thereunder, all in accordance with and pursuant to the terms and provisions
thereof, and the Security Trustee shall have no obligation or liability under
any assigned Lease and the Warranties by reason of or arising out of the
assignment hereunder, nor shall the Security Trustee be required or obligated in
any manner to perform or fulfill any obligations of the Company under any
assigned Lease and the Warranties, or, except as herein expressly provided, to
make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any
payment received by it, or present or file any claim, or take any action to

<PAGE>

                                                                               4

collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it
or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

            The Company does hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the
Security Trustee the true and lawful attorney of the Company (which appointment
is coupled with an interest) with full power (in the name of the Company or
otherwise) to ask, require, demand, receive, compound and give acquittance for
any and all moneys and claims for moneys (in each case including insurance and
requisition proceeds) and all other property which now or hereafter constitutes
part of the Collateral, to endorse any checks or other instruments or orders in
connection therewith and to file any claims or to take any action or to
institute any proceeding which the Security Trustee may deem to be necessary or
advisable to collect such property which constitutes Collateral; provided that
the Security Trustee shall not exercise any such rights except upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default; provided, further,
that the exercise of such rights shall at all times be subject to the rights of
the Senior Trustee under the Senior Mortgage and to the provisions of Section
4.01(c) of this Mortgage. Without limiting the provisions of the foregoing,
during the continuance of any Event of Default, but subject to the terms hereof
and any mandatory requirements of applicable Law, the Security Trustee shall
have the right under such power of attorney in its discretion to file any claim
or to take any other action or proceedings, either in its own name or in the
name of the Company or otherwise, that the Security Trustee may reasonably deem
necessary or appropriate to protect and preserve the right, title and interest
of the Security Trustee in and to the security intended to be afforded hereby.
The Company hereby agrees that, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage has been
discharged, promptly on receipt thereof, except as otherwise contemplated by the
Operative Documents, it will transfer to the Security Trustee any and all moneys
from time to time received by the Company constituting part of the Collateral,
for distribution by the Security Trustee pursuant to this Mortgage.

            The Company does hereby warrant and represent that it has not sold
or assigned, and hereby covenants that it will not sell or assign, so long as
this Mortgage shall remain in effect and the Lien hereof shall not have been
released pursuant to the provisions hereof, any of its estate, right, title or
interest hereby assigned, to any Person other than the Security Trustee, except
as provided in the Senior Mortgage or as expressly permitted herein or in any
other Operative Document.

            The Company agrees that at any time and from time to time, upon the
written request of the Security Trustee, the Company will promptly and duly
execute and deliver or cause to be duly executed and delivered any and all such
further instruments and documents as the Security Trustee may reasonably deem
necessary to perfect and protect the priority of the security interests and
assignments created hereby and to obtain the full benefits of the security
interest granted hereunder and of the rights and powers herein granted.

                  (i) Liens approved in writing by the Security Trustee.

Liens described in clauses (a) through (i) above are referred to herein as

            Section 3.02. Possession, Operation and Use, Maintenance and
Registration.

Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Security Trustee,
sell, lease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer or relinquish
possession of any Engine; provided that if and for so long as all approvals,
consents or authorizations required in connection with any such lease or such
delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession by the FAA (or, if at the
time thereof, the Engine is installed on an airframe registered with any
non-U.S. Government Entity, such other Government Entity) have been obtained and
remain in full force and effect, then the Company may, without the prior written
consent of the Security Trustee:

            (i) so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
      continuing, subject or permit any Lessee to subject any Engine to normal
      interchange, pooling or borrowing, or similar arrangements with persons
      who are domiciled in the United States, in each case for no more than six
      months and customary in the airline industry and entered into in writing
      by the Company (or any Lessee) in the ordinary course of its business;
      provided that (A) no such agreement or arrangement shall contemplate,
      require or result in the transfer of title to such Engine, (B) if the
      Company's title to any Engine shall be divested under any such agreement
      or arrangement, such divestiture shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss
      with respect to such Engine and the Company shall comply with Section
      3.04(a) hereof in respect thereof, and (C) the Company (or a Lessee) shall
      not relinquish possession of an Engine pursuant to this clause (i) for a
      period longer than 180 consecutive days;

            (ii) deliver or permit any Lessee to deliver possession of any
      Engine or any Part (A) to the manufacturer thereof or to any FAA certified
      third-party maintenance provider (or certified by a foreign authority so
      long as work performed on such Engine or Part shall comply with Section
      3.02(c)), for testing, service, repair, maintenance or overhaul work on
      such Engine or Part or to the extent required or permitted by the terms of
      Section 3.03(d) for alterations or modifications in or additions to such
      Engine or Part or (B) to licensed or bonded common carriers qualified in
      the shipping and transport of items such as such Engine or Part for the
      purpose of transport to a Person referred to in the preceding clause (A);
      provided that, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
      continuing, then, prior to delivering (permitting delivery of) possession
      of any Engine or Part to any Person described in clause (A), the Company
      shall put into place such measures as are reasonably satisfactory to the
      Senior Trustee (if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall not then have
      been discharged) or the Security Trustee (if the Lien of the Senior
      Mortgage shall then have been discharged) to ensure that such Person shall
      not assert a Lien against such Engine or Part and shall not have any other
      right of detention of such Engine or Part;

      Liens, except: (A) those of the type permitted under clauses (c), (d), (e)
      and (f) of Section 3.01 and those that apply only to the engines (other
      than Engines) and/or only to parts, appliances, instruments,
      appurtenances, accessories, furnishings and other equipment (other than
      Parts), and (B) the rights of third parties under normal interchange,
      pooling or borrowing, or similar arrangements which would be permitted
      under clause (i) above;

            (iv) install or permit any Lessee to install an Engine on an
      airframe leased to the Company (or such Lessee) or owned by the Company
      (or such Lessee) subject to a mortgage, conditional sale or other security
      agreement; provided that (x) such airframe is free and clear of all Liens,
      except: (A) the rights of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or
      other security agreement covering such airframe, or their assignees, and
      (B) Liens of the type permitted by subclauses (A) and (B) of clause (iii)
      of this Section 3.02(a) and (y) the Company or Lessee, as the case may be,
      shall have received from the lessor, mortgagee, secured party or
      conditional seller, in respect of such airframe, a written agreement
      (which may be a copy of the lease, mortgage, security agreement,
      conditional sale or other agreement covering such airframe), whereby such
      Person agrees that neither such Person nor its successors or assigns will
      acquire or claim any right, title or interest in, or Lien on, such Engine
      by reason of such Engine being installed on such airframe at any time
      while such Engine is subject to the Lien of this Mortgage;

            (v) so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
      continuing, install or permit any Lessee to install an Engine on an
      airframe leased to the Company (or such Lessee) or owned by the Company
      (or such Lessee) subject to a mortgage, conditional sale or other security
      agreement under circumstances where neither clause (iii) nor clause (iv)

      until Section 3.04(a) has been fully complied with the Lien of this
      Mortgage on any such Engine shall continue in full force and effect);

            (vi) transfer possession of any Engine to the U.S. Government
      pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program or any similar program, so
      long as the Company shall promptly notify the Security Trustee thereof
      and, in the case of a transfer pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
      Program, provide the Security Trustee with the name, address and telephone
      number of the Contracting Office Representative for the Air Mobility
      Command of the United States Air Force to whom notice must be given
      pursuant to Section 4.01(a);

            (vii) so long as no Special Default or Event of Default shall have
      occurred and be continuing, enter into a lease with the U.S. Government
      under which the lessee's obligations are guaranteed or supported by the
      full faith and credit of the United States, but only if such lease
      complies, or the Company shall comply, as the case may be, with the
      requirements of subclauses (A)(to the extent practicable), (C)(i) (other
      than with respect to insurance), (C)(ii)-(iii), and (J) of Section
      3.02(a)(viii); or

      (viii) so long as no Special Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, enter into any lease with respect to any Engine with
any Permitted Air Carrier, but only if:

            (A) the Company shall provide at least 15 days' advance written
      notice to the Security Trustee;

            (B) At the time that the Company enters into such lease, such
      Permitted Air Carrier shall not be insolvent (it being agreed that, for
      purposes hereof, "insolvent" shall mean not paying its debts as they
      become due) or subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation,
      reorganization, dissolution or similar proceeding, shall not be seeking
      any reorganization or any readjustment of its debts and shall not be, and
      shall not have substantially all of its property, in the possession of any
      liquidator, trustee, receiver or similar person;

            (C) Any such lease (i) shall include provisions for the maintenance,
      operation, possession, inspection and insurance of such Engine that are
      substantially the same as, or (from a lessor's perspective) more favorable
      than, the applicable provisions of Sections 3.02(a), 3.02(b), 3.02(c),
      3.05 and 3.09, and (ii) shall provide that such Permitted Air Carrier may
      not further lease or transfer its interests (except transfers of the type
      permitted in clauses (i) through (vi), inclusive, of Section 3.02(a)) in
      such Engine;

            (D) In connection with a lease to a Permitted Air Carrier which is
      not a U.S. Air Carrier, all necessary governmental approvals, if any,
      required for such Engine to be imported to, and exported from (upon
      repossession thereof by the Security Trustee or other termination or
      expiration of such lease), the applicable jurisdiction shall have been
      obtained prior to commencement of any such lease, and any foreign exchange
      permits necessary to allow all rent and other payments provided for under
      such lease shall be in full force and effect; and the Company shall have
      provided to the Security Trustee a power-of-attorney, reasonably
      satisfactory in form and substance to the Security Trustee and, to the
      extent permitted by applicable Law, valid and enforceable in the
      applicable jurisdiction, permitting the Security Trustee to exercise all
      rights of the Company under such lease in such jurisdiction, upon the
      occurrence and continuation of a Subordinated Event of Default after the
      Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged;

            (E) In connection with a lease to a Permitted Air Carrier which is
      not a U.S. Air Carrier, (aa) either the jurisdiction in which such
      Permitted Air Carrier is based maintains normal diplomatic relations with
      the United States, or such Permitted Air Carrier is based in Taiwan,
      Republic of China (which shall be deemed an acceptable jurisdiction
      notwithstanding the absence of normal diplomatic relations with the United
      States), and (bb) the Company shall have furnished the Security Trustee a
      favorable opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Security
      Trustee, in the country of domicile of such Permitted Air Carrier, in form
      and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Trustee,

                                                                               9

      that, subject to customary exceptions and qualifications: (i) the terms of
      such lease and this Mortgage are the legal, valid and binding obligations
      of the parties thereto enforceable under the Laws of such jurisdiction,
      (ii) it is not necessary for any Secured Party to register or qualify to
      do business in such jurisdiction, if not already so registered or
      qualified, as a result, in whole or in part, of the proposed lease, (iii)
      the Security Trustee's Lien in respect of such Engine will be recognized
      in such jurisdiction and the Security Trustee shall have a second-priority
      (or, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged,
      first-priority) perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens)
      in the Engines subject to such Lease under the Laws of such jurisdiction,
      (iv) the Laws of such jurisdiction of domicile require fair compensation
      by the government of such jurisdiction, payable in a currency freely
      convertible into Dollars, for the loss of use of or title to such Engine
      in the event of the requisition by such government of such use or title
      (unless the Company shall provide insurance in the amounts required with
      respect to hull insurance under Section 3.05 covering the requisition of
      use of or title to such Engine by the government of such jurisdiction so
      long as such Engine is subject to such lease) and (v) the agreement of
      such Permitted Air Carrier that its rights under the lease are subject and
      subordinate to all the terms of this Mortgage is enforceable against such
      Permitted Air Carrier under applicable Law and the Security Trustee shall
      be able to repossess such Engine, and return it to the United States,
      without undue expense, penalty or delay, upon the occurrence and
      continuation of a Subordinated Event of Default after the Lien of the
      Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged;

            (F) The Company shall furnish to the Security Trustee evidence
      reasonably satisfactory to the Security Trustee that the insurance
      required by Section 3.05 remains in effect;

            (G) All necessary action, if any, shall have been taken to continue
      in full force and effect (i) the perfection of the Security Trustee's
      second-priority (or, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been
      discharged, first-priority) perfected Lien on such Engine (subject to
      Permitted Liens) and (ii) the Security Trustee's rights under this
      Mortgage;

            (H) All necessary documents shall have been duly filed, registered
      or recorded in such public offices as may be required fully to preserve
      the priority of the interest of the Security Trustee in such Engine;

            (I) Each such lease shall be assigned by the Company to the Security
      Trustee as security for the performance of all of the Company's
      obligations under this Mortgage (with the Company retaining all rights of
      lessor thereunder, to the extent consistent with this Section
      3.02(a)(viii), if and for so long as there shall not have occurred and be
      continuing an Event of Default), with the express consent of such
      Permitted Air Carrier;

            (J) The Company shall furnish to the Security Trustee a written
      confirmation (which may be contained in any relevant operative agreement)
      from

                                                                              10

      the lessee and any owner, lessor or mortgagee of any aircraft on which
      such Engine is installed by such Lessee that each such party shall
      recognize the Company's rights and interests in, and the rights and
      interests of the Security Trustee in the leased Engine and,
      notwithstanding any contrary provisions of applicable Laws, its rights and
      benefits under which are hereby waived to the extent in conflict with this
      provision, no such party shall claim, as against the Company or the
      Security Trustee, any right, title or interest in such Engine as a result
      of such Engine being subject to such lease or installed on any aircraft as
      a result of such lease; and

            (K) The Company shall reimburse the reasonable out-of-pocket fees
      and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
      disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Security Trustee in connection
      with any such lease.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02(a),
the rights of any Lessee or other transferee who receives possession of an
Engine by reason of a transfer permitted by this Section 3.02(a) (other than the
transfer of an Engine which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject and
subordinate to, and any lease permitted by this Section 3.02(a) shall include a
provision that makes it expressly subject and subordinate to, all the terms of
this Mortgage and to the Lien of this Mortgage, including, without limitation,
(i) the Security Trustee's rights to foreclosure and possession pursuant to
Section 4.01, (ii) the Security Trustee's right to terminate and avoid such
lease, delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession upon the occurrence
and continuation of a Subordinated Event of Default after the Lien of the Senior
Mortgage shall have been discharged and (iii) the right to require such person
to forthwith deliver such Engine subject to such transfer upon the occurrence
and continuation of a Subordinated Event of Default after the Lien of the Senior
Mortgage shall have been discharged. The Company shall remain primarily liable
hereunder for the performance of all of the terms of this Mortgage to the same
extent as if such lease or transfer had not occurred, and, except as otherwise
provided herein, the terms of any such lease shall not permit any Lessee to take
any action not permitted to be taken by the Company in this Mortgage with
respect to the Engines. No pooling arrangement, lease or other relinquishment of
possession of any Engine or Engine Documents shall in any way discharge or
diminish any of the Company's obligations to the Security Trustee hereunder or
constitute a waiver of the Security Trustee's rights or remedies hereunder.
Except as otherwise provided herein and without in any way relieving the Company
from its primary obligation for the performance of its obligations under this
Mortgage, the Company may in its sole discretion permit a Lessee to exercise any
or all rights which the Company would be entitled to exercise under Article III,
and may cause a Lessee to perform any or all of the Company's obligations under
Article III (provided that a Lessee may not lease or otherwise in any manner
deliver, transfer or relinquish possession of an Engine except as expressly
permitted by this Mortgage), and the Security Trustee agrees to accept actual
and full performance thereof by a Lessee in lieu of performance by the Company.
Any Wet Lease shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of
possession for purposes of Section 3.02(a) and shall not be prohibited by the
terms hereof. Any event that constitutes or would, with the passage of time,
constitute an Event of Loss under paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of
such term (as set forth in Appendix A) shall not be deemed to violate the
provisions of this Section 3.02.

                                                                              11

            (b) Operation and Use. The Company shall not, and shall not allow
any other person to, operate, use, maintain, service, repair or overhaul the
Engines (i) in violation of any Law binding on or applicable to the Company or
to any Engine, or any of the Engine Documents, or to the operation, use,
maintenance, service, repair or overhaul of, or similar dealings in, any Engine,
or (ii) in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration
of any Government Entity relating to the Company or to any Engine, except (1)
immaterial or non-recurring violations with respect to which corrective measures
are taken promptly by the Company or a Lessee, as the case may be, upon
discovery thereof, and (2) to the extent the Company or any Lessee is contesting
the validity or application of any such Law, rule, regulation, order,
certificate, license or registration in good faith in any reasonable manner
which does not involve any material risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss
(including loss of use) of any Engine or any of the Engine Documents or any
interest therein or any discernible risk of criminal liability or any material
risk of civil penalty against any Secured Party or impair the lien of the
Mortgage. The Company agrees not to operate, use or locate any Engine, or allow
any Engine to be operated, used or located (A) in any area excluded from
coverage by any insurance required by the terms of Section 3.05, except in the
case of a requisition by the U.S. Government where the Company obtains an
indemnity in lieu of such insurance from the U.S. Government, or insurance from
the U.S. Government, covering such area, in accordance with Section 3.05(c) or
(B) in any recognized or threatened area of hostilities unless fully covered in
accordance with Appendix B by war-risk insurance as required by the terms of
Section 3.05 (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(c)), unless the Engine
is only temporarily located in such area as a result of an emergency, equipment
malfunction, navigational error, hijacking, weather condition or other similar
unforeseen circumstances, so long as the Company diligently and in good faith
proceeds to remove the Engine from such area immediately.

            (c) Maintenance. The Company, at its own cost and expense, shall (or
shall cause a Lessee to) maintain, service, repair and overhaul (or cause to be
maintained, serviced, repaired and overhauled) each Engine in accordance with
the requirements of an FAA or JAA approved maintenance program so as to keep
each Engine serviceable (except when undergoing overhaul) and in as good
operating condition as when initially subjected to the Lien hereof, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and as may be necessary and required under applicable
Law, including the Federal Aviation Act, airworthiness directives, and other
applicable rules, regulations and requirements by any government authority,
utilizing, except during any period that a Lease is in effect, the same manner
and standard of maintenance, service, repair or overhaul used by the Company
with respect to engines similar to such Engine operated by the Company and
utilizing, during any period that a Lease is in effect, the same manner and
standard of maintenance, service, repair or overhaul used by the Lessee with
respect to engines similar to such Engine operated by the Lessee. The Company
further agrees that the Engines will be maintained, used, serviced, repaired,
overhauled or inspected in compliance with applicable Laws with respect to the
maintenance of the Engines and in compliance with each applicable airworthiness
certificate, license and registration of any Government Entity, including the
FAA, relating to any Engine, other than minor or nonrecurring violations with
respect to which corrective measures are taken upon discovery thereof and except
to the extent the Company or Lessee is contesting in good faith the validity or
application of any such Law or requirement relating to any such certificate,
license or registration in any reasonable manner which does not create a risk of
sale, loss or forfeiture of any Engine or the interest of the Security Trustee
therein, any material risk of civil liability or any risk of criminal liability.
If an Engine becomes

                                                                              12

unserviceable, the Company shall commence the restoration process with respect
to such Engine in due course; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
responsible for any delays by a third-party maintenance provider unless such
delay is caused by a breach of an obligation of the Company to the third-party
maintenance provider. If an Engine is not installed on an airframe for a period
in excess of thirty consecutive days and is not undergoing maintenance during
such period, the Company (or a Lessee) shall store such Engine in accordance
with the requirements of the Company's (or, if applicable, a Lessee's) FAA or
JAA approved maintenance program. The Company agrees that an Engine may only be
serviced, overhauled and repaired in an FAA-approved maintenance facility. The
Company agrees that it will commence the restoration process with respect to any
Engine that is not in serviceable condition on a timely basis. The Company shall
maintain or cause to be maintained all Engine Documents in respect of each
Engine in accordance with the requirements of the Company's (or if such Engine
is subject to a Lease, Lessee's) FAA or JAA approved maintenance program.

            (d) Identification of Security Trustee's Interest. As promptly as
possible, and in any case within 180 days following the Closing Date, the
Company agrees to affix and maintain (or cause to be affixed and maintained), at
its expense, on each Engine a nameplate (which shall be provided to the Company
by the Security Trustee) bearing the inscription:

            "THIS ENGINE IS SUBJECT TO A MORTGAGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT IN
            FAVOR OF WELLS FARGO BANK NORTHWEST, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS
            SECURITY TRUSTEE"

(such nameplate to be replaced if there is a successor Security Trustee). Such
nameplate may be removed temporarily in the course of maintenance of an Engine.

            Section 3.03. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions.

            (a) Replacement of Parts. So long as an Engine is subject to the
Lien of this Mortgage, the Company, at its own cost and expense, will promptly
replace or cause to be replaced all Parts which may from time to time be
incorporated or installed in or attached to any Engine and which may from time
to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged
beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever,
except as otherwise provided in Section 3.03(d) hereof or if an Engine to which
a Part relates has suffered an Event of Loss. In addition, the Company (or any
Lessee) may, at its own cost and expense, remove in the ordinary course of
maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing, any Parts, whether or not
worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or
permanently rendered unfit for use; provided that the Company (or such Lessee),
except as otherwise provided in Section 3.03(d) hereof, will, at its own cost
and expense, replace such Parts as promptly as practicable. All replacement
Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens, pooling
arrangements to the extent permitted by Section 3.03(c) and except in the case
of replacement property temporarily installed on an emergency basis) and shall
be in good operating condition, and shall have a value and utility (without
regard to hours and cycles) at least equal to, the Parts replaced (assuming such
replaced Parts were in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the
terms hereof); provided that each replacement Part shall have at least enough
remaining hours, cycles and calendar life

<PAGE>

                                                                              13

(as applicable) at the time of its installation on the relevant Engine to last
until the next expected maintenance event of such Engine. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere in this Section 3.03(a), (x) no
removal and replacement of Parts pursuant to this Section 3.03(a) shall be
permitted for the purpose of diminishing the value, utility or remaining useful
life of any Engine, and (y) neither the Company nor any Lessee shall be
permitted to remove or replace any Parts pursuant to this Section 3.03(a) in any
manner, for any reason, or on any basis that would discriminate against the
interests of the Security Trustee in any Engine (as compared to other aircraft
engines of the same type owned, leased or operated by the Company or any Lessee,
as the case may be).

            (b) Parts Subject to Lien. Except as otherwise provided in Section
3.03(d) hereof, all Parts at any time removed from any Engine shall remain
subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, no matter where located, until such time
as such Parts shall be replaced by Parts that have been incorporated or
installed in or attached to such Engine and which meet the requirements for
replacement Parts specified in Section 3.03(a) hereof. Immediately upon any
replacement part becoming incorporated or installed in or attached to an Engine
as provided in Section 3.03(a) hereof, without further act (subject only to
Permitted Liens and except in the case of replacement property temporarily
installed on an emergency basis), (i) the replaced Part shall thereupon be free
and clear of the Lien of this Mortgage and all rights of the Security Trustee
and shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder and (ii) the replacement part
shall be deemed a Part hereunder and such replacement Part shall become subject
to the Lien of this Mortgage and be deemed part of such Engine for all purposes
hereof to the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in
or attached to such Engine.

            (c) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from any Engine as provided
in Section 3.03(a) hereof may be subjected by the Company (or any Lessee) to a
normal pooling arrangement customary in the commercial airline industry of which
the Company (or any Lessee) is a party entered into in the ordinary course of
the Company's (or such Lessee's) business; provided that the Part replacing such
removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to such Engine in
accordance with Sections 3.03(a) and 3.03(b) hereof as promptly as practicable
after the removal of such removed Part. In addition, any replacement Part when
incorporated or installed in or attached to any Engine in accordance with
Section 3.03(a) hereof may be owned by any third party subject to such a normal
pooling arrangement; provided that the Company (or any Lessee), at its expense,
as promptly thereafter as practicable, either (i) causes such replacement Part
to become subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, free and clear of all Liens
except Permitted Liens, at which time such temporary replacement Part shall
become a Part or (ii) replaces such replacement Part by incorporating or
installing in or attaching to such Engine a further replacement Part which is
subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, free and clear of all Liens except
Permitted Liens.

            (d) Alterations; Modifications and Additions. The Company, at its
own expense, will make or cause to be made such alterations and modifications in
and additions to any Engine as may be required to be made from time to time to
meet the applicable standards of the FAA or JAA, to the extent made mandatory in
respect of the Engines; provided, however, that the Company in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings may contest the validity or application of any such
mandatory modification in any reasonable manner which does not involve any risk
of loss, sale or forfeiture of any Engine, or result in any risk of criminal
liability

<PAGE>

                                                                              14

or material civil liability to any Secured Party or materially adversely affect
the Security Trustee's interest in such Engine. In addition, the Company, at its
own expense, may, or may permit a Lessee at its own cost and expense to, from
time to time make or cause to be made such alterations and modifications in and
additions to any Engine (each an "Optional Modification") as the Company or such
Lessee may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business including,
without limitation, removal of Parts which the Company deems are obsolete or no
longer suitable or appropriate for use in such Engine; provided, however, that
(i) no such Optional Modification shall materially diminish the value, utility,
or useful life of any Engine below its value, utility or useful life immediately
prior to such Optional Modification (assuming such Engine was in the condition
required by the Mortgage immediately prior to such Optional Modification) and
(ii) such Optional Modification shall have been approved by the applicable
Engine Manufacturer or the FAA or JAA, as applicable. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or
added to any Engine as the result of any such alteration, modification or
addition (the "Additional Parts") shall become subject to the Lien of this
Mortgage. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company (or any Lessee)
may remove or suffer to be removed any Additional Part; provided that such
Additional Part (i) is in addition to, and not in replacement of or in
substitution for, any Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to such Engine on the date that the Company originally acquired such Engine or
any Part in replacement of, or in substitution for, any such Part, (ii) is not
required to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such Engine
pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02(c) hereof, the terms of the insurance
policies required to be carried hereunder or any applicable law or the first
sentence of this Section 3.03(d), and (iii) can be removed from such Engine
without materially diminishing the value, utility or remaining useful life which
such Engine would have had at the time of removal had such alteration,
modification or addition not occurred, assuming that such Engine was in the
condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof. Upon the
removal by the Company (or any Lessee) of any such Part as above provided, such
Part shall, without further act, be free and clear of the Lien of this Mortgage
and all rights of the Security Trustee and such Part shall no longer be deemed a
Part hereunder.

            Section 3.04. Event of Loss and Release of Engines.

            (a) Event of Loss With Respect to an Engine. Upon the occurrence of
an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after such occurrence) give the Security
Trustee written notice of such Event of Loss. The Company shall, within thirty
(30) days after the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine
give the Security Trustee written notice of its election to perform one of the
following options (it being agreed that, if the Company shall not have given
notice of such election within such 30-day period, the Company shall be deemed
to have elected the option in clause (i) of the next sentence). The Company may
elect either to (i) repay a principal amount of the Loan in an amount equal to
the Stipulated Loss Value of such Engine (or Termination Value of such Engine,
if Section 3.04(h)(3)(ii) of the Senior Mortgage is applicable), plus accrued
interest thereon and any other amounts in accordance with Section 1.1(d) of the
Loan Agreement (or, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage has been discharged, pay
to the Security Trustee, to be held by the Security Trustee as cash collateral
under this Mortgage, an amount equal to the Stipulated Loss Value of such
Engine, or Termination Value of such Engine if Section 3.04(i)(3)(ii) hereof is
applicable), on or prior to the

                                                                              15

earlier of (A) the sixty-first (61st) day following the Event of Loss and (B)
the third Business Day following the receipt of insurance proceeds with respect
to such occurrence (but in any event not earlier than the date of the Company's
election under the preceding sentence of this Section to make payment under this
clause (i)), or (ii) cause to be subjected to the Lien of this Mortgage in
replacement thereof not later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the
occurrence of such Event of Loss, a Replacement Engine, owned by the Company and
free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens; provided that if the Company
does not perform its obligation to effect such replacement in accordance with
this Section 3.04(a) during the period of time provided herein, then the Company
shall be deemed to have elected to make the payment contemplated by clause (i)
of this sentence within the period of time specified therein. The Company shall
not be entitled to elect the replacement option pursuant to clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence if, at the time the Company gives notice pursuant to the
preceding sentence there shall have occurred and be continuing a Special Default
or an Event of Default. A Replacement Engine for an Engine suffering an Event of
Loss must meet each of the following conditions:

            (1) be of the same model as the Engine to be replaced thereby, or an
      improved model, manufactured by the same Engine Manufacturer;

            (2) have a value, utility and remaining useful life at least equal
      to and be in at least as good operating condition as, the Engine to be
      replaced thereby (assuming that such Engine was of the value and utility
      and in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately
      prior to the occurrence of the Event of Loss); and

            (3) have been first placed in service after October 22, 1994, or, if
      different, meet whatever conditions or requirements as may be required in
      order for the Security Trustee to be entitled to the benefits of Section
      1110 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to such Replacement Engine in the
      event of a case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in which the
      Company is a debtor; provided, however, that the requirement set forth in
      this subclause (3) shall not apply (A) with respect to the first Engine to
      suffer an Event of Loss, or (B) if, after giving effect to the replacement
      of the Engine suffering the Event of Loss by the Replacement Engine
      proposed by the Company, the ratio (both by number of Engines and by
      value) of Engines for which the Security Trustee is entitled to the
      benefits of Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code in the event of a case
      under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in which the Company is a debtor
      to all Engines then subject to the Lien of this Mortgage is equal to or
      greater than the ratio of the Specified Engines to all Engines subject to
      the Lien of this Mortgage as of the Closing Date.

            (b) Effect of Replacement or Payment. Upon the Company having
provided a Replacement Engine as provided in Section 3.04(a) above, the Lien of
this Mortgage shall attach to such Replacement Engine as though no Event of Loss
had occurred. Upon the Company having provided a Replacement Engine or having
made a repayment of the Loan (or payment to the Security Trustee of cash
collateral) pursuant to Section 3.04(a), the Security Trustee shall, at the cost
and expense of the Company, release from the Lien of this Mortgage the Engine
subject to such Event of Loss, and all Engine Documents and Warranties relating
to such Engine, by executing and delivering to the Company such documents and
instruments as the Company may reasonably request to evidence such release and
shall assign without recourse or representation to

                                                                              16

the Company all claims it may have against any other Person arising from the
Event of Loss and the Company shall receive all insurance proceeds and other
proceeds from any award in respect of condemnation, confiscation, seizure or
requisition, including all investment interest thereon, to the extent not
previously applied to the purchase price of the Replacement Engine as provided
in Sections 3.04(d)(i) and 3.05 hereof.

            (c) Conditions to Engine Replacement. The Company's right to make a
replacement under Section 3.04(a) hereof shall be subject to the fulfillment, at
the Company's cost and expense, of the following conditions precedent:

            (1) On the date that the Replacement Engine is made subject to the
      Lien of this Mortgage (the "Replacement Closing Date"), no Special Default
      or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

            (2) On the Replacement Closing Date, an executed counterpart of each
      of the following shall have been delivered to the Security Trustee, in
      each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security
      Trustee:

                  (A) a Mortgage Supplement covering the Replacement Engine
            (which shall be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal
            Aviation Act);

                  (B) such Uniform Commercial Code financing statements covering
            the Lien created by this Mortgage as deemed necessary by the
            Security Trustee to protect the security interests of the Security
            Trustee in the Replacement Engine;

                  (C) a certificate of a qualified aircraft engineer (who may be
            an employee of the Company) or, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage
            shall have been discharged and the Security Trustee makes written
            request to the Company within five Business Days after the Company
            shall have furnished to the Security Trustee the information
            referred to in Section 3.04(c)(5)(C), an independent appraiser
            specified in such request (provided such appraiser is reasonably
            acceptable to the Company), whose fees and expenses shall be paid by
            the Security Trustee if the appraiser's report supports the
            certificate delivered by the Company's aircraft engineer pursuant to
            this Section 3.04(c)(2)(C) and paid by the Company in all other
            circumstances, certifying that such Replacement Engine meets all of
            the requirements set forth in subclauses (1), (2) and (3) of
            Section 3.04(a), as applicable; and

                  (D) a copy of a bill of sale, manufacturer's invoice or other
            evidence of the Company's title with respect to the Replacement
            Engine.

            (3) The Security Trustee shall have received evidence satisfactory
      to the Security Trustee as to the due compliance with Section 3.05 hereof
      with respect to the Replacement Engine;

            (4) On the Replacement Closing Date, the Company shall be the owner
      of the Replacement Engine and shall cause the Replacement Engine to be
      subjected to the Lien of this Mortgage, free and clear of Liens (other
      than Permitted Liens);

<PAGE>

                                                                              17

            (5) The Security Trustee shall, at the expense of the Company, have
      received (A) an opinion addressed to the Security Trustee, reasonably
      satisfactory to the Security Trustee, to the effect that (i) the
      Replacement Engine has been made subject to the Lien of this Mortgage,
      (ii) the Security Trustee will be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110
      of the Bankruptcy Code (or any successor or replacement statute) with
      respect to the Replacement Engine to the extent that the benefits of
      Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any successor or replacement
      statute) are required to be available to the Security Trustee with respect
      to such Replacement Engine in accordance with Section 3.04(a)(3) and (iii)
      to such further effect as the Security Trustee may reasonably request
      (including, if the Replacement Engine will be subject to a Lease to a
      Permitted Air Carrier which is not a U.S. Air Carrier upon effectiveness
      of such replacement, to the effect provided in clause (iii) of Section
      3.02(a)(viii)(E)), (B) an opinion of FAA counsel addressed to the Security
      Trustee, reasonably satisfactory to the Security Trustee, respecting the
      due filing for recordation with the FAA of the Mortgage Supplement with
      respect to such Replacement Engine, the perfection and priority of the
      Lien of this Mortgage thereon and as to such other matters concerning the
      Federal Aviation Act as the Security Trustee may reasonably request and
      (C) at least six Business Days before the Replacement Closing Date the
      information specified in Section 6.11 of the Indemnity Agreement with
      respect to the Replacement Engine as of a date within 30 days prior to the
      date such information is furnished to the Security Trustee; and

            (6) The Company shall have taken such other actions and furnished
      such other certificates and documents as the Security Trustee shall have
      reasonably requested in order that such Replacement Engine be duly and
      properly subjected to the Lien of this Mortgage to the same extent as
      initially required under the Operative Documents with respect to the
      Engine so replaced.

            (d) Payments Received on Account of an Event of Loss. If the Lien of
the Senior Mortgage shall not have been discharged, any payments on account of
an Event of Loss (other than insurance proceeds or other payments the
application of which is provided for in Section 3.05 hereof, or elsewhere in
this Mortgage, as the case may be, or payments in respect of damage to the
business or property of the Company) with respect to an Engine shall be held and
applied as provided in the Senior Mortgage and, after the Senior Mortgage shall
have been discharged, as between the Security Trustee and the Company, any such
payments (other than as aforesaid) received at any time by the Security Trustee
or by the Company from any Government Entity or other Person will be applied as
follows:

            (i) if such payments are received with respect to an Event of Loss
      as to an Engine and such Engine is being replaced by the Company pursuant
      to Section 3.04(a) hereof, such payments shall be paid over to, or
      retained by, the Security Trustee as security; and upon completion of such
      replacement (or upon the closing therefor) and compliance with the
      provisions of Section 3.04(a) and (c) with respect to the Event of Loss
      for which such payments are made, all such payments, including all
      investment earnings thereon shall be promptly paid over to, or retained
      by, the Company; and

<PAGE>

                                                                              18

            (ii) if the Company has elected or is deemed to have elected to make
      the payment referred to in clause (i) of the third sentence of Section
      3.04(a), such payments shall be applied as follows:

            first, if the sum described in such clause (i) has not then been
      paid in full by the Company, such payments shall be deposited with the
      Security Trustee as cash collateral up to the amount required to be paid
      under such clause (i); and

            second, the balance, if any, shall be paid to, or retained by, the
      Company.

            (e) Requisition of Use. After the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall
have been discharged, in the event of a requisition for use by a Government
Entity of such Engine not constituting an Event of Loss, any payments received
by the Security Trustee or the Company (or any Lessee of the applicable Engine)
from such government with respect to such requisition shall be retained by or
paid to the Company (or such Lessee, as the case may be).

            (f) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of Default.
After the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged, any amount
referred to in this Section 3.04 or Section 3.05 which is payable to or
retainable by the Company (or any Lessee) shall not be paid to or retained by
the Company (or such Lessee), if at the time of such payment or retention a
Special Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
but shall be held by or paid over to the Security Trustee as security for the
Obligations. Upon the earlier of (a) such time as there shall not be continuing
any such Special Default or Event of Default or (b) the termination of this
Mortgage in accordance with Section 7.01, such amount, and any interest realized
thereon pursuant to Section 6.01 hereof, shall be paid over to the Company (or
such Lessee) to the extent not previously applied in accordance with the
preceding sentence.

            (g) Engine Exchange. Upon not less than ten (10) Business Days'
prior written notice from the Company to the Security Trustee, provided no
Special Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and
subject to compliance with Section 3.04(i) hereof if the final sentence of such
Section is then applicable, the Security Trustee shall release from the Lien of
this Mortgage pursuant to Section 3.04(b) one or more Engines specified in such
notice (herein, the "Released Engine") upon the replacement of such Engines with
other engines (the "Exchanged Engines") meeting the requirements of Section
3.04(a). Any such Exchanged Engine shall be deemed to be a "Replacement Engine"
and the Security Trustee and the Company shall comply with the provisions of
Section 3.04 with regard to the Exchanged Engine and the Released Engine,
provided that if the Security Trustee requests a certificate of an independent
appraiser pursuant to Section 3.04(c)(2)(C), then, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Section 3.04(c)(2)(C), the fees and expenses of such appraiser
shall be paid by the Security Trustee if the Security Trustee does not have a
reasonable basis for requesting such appraisal and the appraisal supports the
report of the Company's aircraft engineer, and such fees and expenses shall be
paid by the Company in all other circumstances.

            (h) Release of Cash Collateral. If the Company shall have paid to
the Security Trustee funds to be held as cash collateral pursuant to Section
3.04(a) due to the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine,
upon (i) not less than five (5) Business Days' prior

<PAGE>

                                                                              19

written notice from the Company to the Security Trustee and (ii) the Company
causing a Replacement Engine for such Engine meeting the requirements of Section
3.04(a) to be subject to the Lien of this Mortgage in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.04(c) hereof, the Security Agent shall release to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of such cash
collateral, plus any net earnings thereon pursuant to Section 6.01, then subject
to Lien of this Mortgage.

            (i) Permitted Dispositions. Upon not less than ten (10) Business
Days' prior written notice from the Company to the Security Trustee, provided no
Special Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Security Trustee shall release from the Lien of this Mortgage pursuant to
Section 3.04(b) one or more Engines specified in such notice (the "Disposed
Engines") that the Company is disposing, or intends to dispose, in the ordinary
course of its business (a "Permitted Disposition") (treating such Disposed
Engines, for the purposes of Section 3.04(b) as Engines having suffered an Event
of Loss) if, but only if, each of the following conditions is satisfied:

            (1) the Company delivers to the Security Trustee an Officer's
      Certificate certifying that (i) each of the Disposed Engines is surplus to
      the operational needs of the Company and is not required to meet the fleet
      planning needs of the Company in the ordinary course of its business, and
      (ii) the Company has not, and does not intend to, acquire by any means
      whatsoever any replacement for any of the Disposed Engines as support for
      the Company's operations (it being expressly understood that any purchase,
      lease or sublease of one or more other engines and any other arrangement
      permitting the Company access to or use of one or more other engines would
      all be considered a replacement of the Disposed Engines within the meaning
      of this Section 3.04(i)(1)(ii));

            (2) except with respect to the first Disposed Engine to be disposed
      of by the Company and released from the Lien of this Mortgage pursuant to
      this Section 3.04(i) during the term of this Mortgage (for which it is
      agreed that the condition set forth in this subclause (2) shall not
      apply), after giving effect to the disposal of the Disposed Engines, the
      ratio (both by number of Engines and by value) of remaining Engines for
      which the Security Trustee is entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of
      the Bankruptcy Code in the event of a case under Chapter 11 of the
      Bankruptcy Code in which the Company is a debtor to all Engines then
      remaining subject to the Lien of this Mortgage is equal to or greater than
      the ratio of the Specified Engines to all Engines subject to the Lien of
      this Mortgage as of the Closing Date; and

            (3) the Company shall have paid, in immediately available funds, in
      accordance with clause (i) of the third sentence of Section 3.04(a), a
      prepayment of the principal amount of the Loan (plus accrued interest
      thereon and any other amounts payable therewith in accordance with Section
      1.1(d) of the Loan Agreement) if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then
      in effect, and a payment to the Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior
      Mortgage has been discharged, in an amount equal to (i) with respect to
      any such disposition occurring on or after the Designated Date, and any
      such disposition of up to four Disposed Engines at any time prior to the
      Designated Date (provided that if all such Disposed Engines are
      manufactured by CFM International, Inc., up to five Disposed Engines prior
      to the Designated Date), the Stipulated Loss Value of the Disposed Engine,

<PAGE>

                                                                              20

      and (ii) with respect to any such disposition of a Disposed Engine as to
      which the preceding clause (i) does not apply, the Termination Value of
      the Disposed Engine.

            (j) Additional Collateral. If (i) the Company exercises its right to
make one or more Exchanged Engines subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, (ii)
any such Exchanged Engine has fewer hours or cycles or less calendar time
remaining to next expected major overhaul than the corresponding Released Engine
(any such Exchanged Engine being referred to herein as a "Short Time Engine")
and (iii) at any time thereafter two consecutive quarterly engine reports
(prepared in accordance with Section 6.11 of the Indemnity Agreement) indicate
that all of the Engines subject to the Lien of this Mortgage have on average
less than 4,393 hours or less than 2,899 cycles remaining until the next
expected major overhaul, then the Company shall, within five (5) Business Days
following the due date of the second such quarterly engine report, comply with
all of the following requirements:

            (1) With respect to all such Short Time Engines, the Company shall
      furnish the Senior Trustee, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then in
      effect, and the Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is not
      then in effect, with a certificate of an independent appraiser selected by
      the Senior Trustee, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then in effect,
      and the Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is not then in
      effect, and reasonably satisfactory to Company certifying as to difference
      in value, if any, set forth in dollars, based on the difference in hours,
      cycles and calendar time since last shop visit, or since new, as
      applicable, as of the date of such exchange, between each such Short Time
      Engine and the corresponding Released Engine (the cumulative aggregate
      amount of any and each such deficiency in value between a Short Time
      Engine and the corresponding Released Engine being referred to herein as
      the "Exchange Shortfall Amount"); and

            (2) If the independent appraiser's report prepared pursuant to
      Section 3.04(j)(1) hereof sets forth an Exchange Shortfall Amount, the
      Company shall provide the Senior Trustee, if the Lien of the Senior
      Mortgage is then in effect, and the Security Trustee if the Lien of the
      Senior Mortgage is not then in effect, with a letter of credit that is in
      an amount equal to the Exchange Shortfall Amount and that otherwise meets
      all of the following requirements (each such letter of credit, a "Letter
      of Credit"):

                  (i) Such Letter of Credit must be issued and payable by a
            Pre-Approved Bank or another bank acceptable to the Senior Trustee,
            if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then in effect, and the
            Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is not then in
            effect, in its sole and absolute discretion and in substantially the
            form of Exhibit B or in another form and substance acceptable to the
            Senior Trustee, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then in
            effect, and the Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage
            is not then in effect, in its sole and absolute discretion, and, if
            not issued by a Pre-Approved Bank or the New York branch of a major
            international bank acceptable to the Senior Trustee, if the Lien of
            the Senior Mortgage is then in effect, and the Security Trustee if
            the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is not then in effect, in its sole
            and absolute discretion from time to time, will be confirmed by and
            payable at a Pre-Approved Bank or the New York branch of a major
            international bank acceptable to the Senior

<PAGE>

                                                                              21

            Trustee, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then in effect, and
            the Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is not then
            in effect, in its sole and absolute discretion from time to time,
            and shall remain in full force and effect and may be drawn down by
            the Senior Trustee, if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage is then in
            effect, and the Security Trustee if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage
            is not then in effect, upon demand at any time or times following
            the occurrence of an Event of Default until the Required LC Expiry
            Date.

                  (ii) Such Letter of Credit may have a validity period or
            periods ending prior to the Required LC Expiry Date, provided that
            (i) the Letter of Credit shall, in each case, be renewed, extended
            or reissued and delivered to the Security Trustee not later than
            sixty (60) days prior to its expiry; and (ii) a Letter of Credit
            shall remain in force at all times up to the Required LC Expiry
            Date.

                  (iii) If at any time while the Lien of this Mortgage remains
            in effect, and after the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been
            discharged, the Security Trustee determines in its sole and absolute
            discretion that the current issuing or confirming bank for the
            Letter of Credit is no longer an acceptable issuing or confirming
            bank (whether by virtue of a material adverse change in its
            financial condition, a decrease in any credit rating of its
            long-term unsecured debt obligations or for any other reason) the
            Security Trustee shall notify the Company of such fact and the
            Company shall within five (5) Business Days after the date of such
            notice cause the Letter of Credit to be replaced by a Letter of
            Credit issued by a Pre-Approved Bank or another bank acceptable to
            the Security Trustee in its sole and absolute.

Provided that no Special Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is
continuing, the Security Trustee shall release and return to the Company each
such Letter of Credit held by the Security Trustee at such time as the Short
Time Engine to which such Letter of Credit relates has completed a major
overhaul. The proceeds of any drawing upon a Letter of Credit by the Security
Trustee for any reason other than the occurrence of an Event of Default shall be
held by the Security Trustee as cash collateral in accordance with Section 6.01
hereof. If the Company proposes to exercise its right to provide a Short Time
Engine hereunder at any time when a Letter of Credit is in place with respect to
a prior exercise of such right, the Company shall provide the report described
in clause (1) above with respect to the proposed exchange and, if such report
shows a further Exchange Shortfall Amount, the Company shall comply with clause
(2) above as a condition to making such exchange.

      Trustee or any other Secured Party from obtaining insurance for its own
      account (and any proceeds payable under such separate insurance shall be
      payable as provided in the policy relating thereto); provided, however,
      that no insurance may be obtained or maintained that would limit or
      otherwise adversely affect the coverage of any insurance required to be
      obtained or maintained by the Company pursuant to this Section 3.05 and
      Appendix B.

                  (c) Indemnification by Government in Lieu of Insurance.
      Security Trustee agrees to accept, in lieu of insurance against any risk
      with respect to any Aircraft or Engine described in Appendix B,
      indemnification from, or insurance provided by, the U.S. Government, or
      upon the written consent of Security Trustee, other Government Entity,
      against such risk in an amount that, when added to the amount of insurance
      (including permitted self-insurance), if any, against such risk that the
      Company (or any Lessee) may continue to maintain, in accordance with this
      Section 3.05, shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance against
      such risk otherwise required by this Section 3.05.

                  (d) Application of Insurance Proceeds. All proceeds of
      insurance required to be maintained by the Company, in accordance with
      Section 3.05 and Section B of Appendix B, in respect of any property
      damage or loss, whether or not constituting an Event of Loss, shall be
      adjusted, paid and applied in the manner specified in Section B of
      Appendix B.

            Section 3.06. Filings. The Company will take, or cause to be taken,
at the Company's cost and expense, such action with respect to the recording,
filing, re-recording and re-filing of this Mortgage, each Mortgage Supplement
and any financing statements or other instruments as are necessary, or
reasonably requested by the Security Trustee and appropriate, to maintain, so
long as this Mortgage is in effect, the perfection and priority of the Lien
created by this Mortgage, or will furnish to the Security Trustee timely notice
of the necessity of such action, together with such instruments, in execution
form, and such other information as may be required to enable the Security
Trustee to take such action. In addition, the Company will pay any and all
recording, stamp and other similar taxes payable in the United States, in
connection with the execution, delivery, recording, filing, re-recording and
refiling of this Mortgage or any such financing statements or other instruments.
The Company will notify the Security Trustee of any change in its jurisdiction
of organization (as such term is used in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code as in effect in the State of Delaware) promptly after making such change or
in any event within the period of time necessary under applicable law to prevent
the lapse of perfection (absent refiling) of financing statements filed under
the Operative Documents.

            Section 3.07. Merger, Consolidation. The Company shall not
consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all of its assets as an entirety to any Person unless:

            (i) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the
      Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or
      lease substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety shall
      be a Certificated Air Carrier;

<PAGE>

                                                                              23

            (ii) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the
      Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or
      lease substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety shall
      execute and deliver to the Security Trustee a duly authorized, valid,
      binding and enforceable agreement in form and substance reasonably
      satisfactory to the Security Trustee containing an assumption by such
      Person of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant
      and condition of the Operative Documents to be performed or observed by
      the Company;

            (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event
      of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

            (iv) all filings shall have been made as shall be necessary to
      preserve the perfection of the Lien of the Mortgage on each Engine on a
      second priority and perfected basis; and

            (v) promptly after the consummation of such transaction, the Company
      shall deliver to the Security Trustee a certificate of the Secretary or an
      Assistant Secretary of Company certifying as to Company's compliance with
      the conditions of this Section 3.07 and an opinion of Company's Legal
      Department as to Company's compliance with Sections 3.07(i), 3.07(ii) and
      3.07(iv).

Upon any such consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer or lease of
substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety in accordance with
this Section, the successor corporation or Person formed by such consolidation
or into which the Company is merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or
lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every
right and power of, the Company under this Mortgage and the other Operative
Documents with the same effect as if such successor corporation or Person had
been named as the Company herein. No such conveyance, transfer or lease of
substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety shall have the
effect of releasing the Company or any successor corporation or Person which
shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in this Section from
its liability in respect of any Operative Document to which it is a party.

            Section 3.08. Notice of Change of the Company's Location. The
Company will notify the Security Trustee of any change in the location of the
Company (within the meaning of Section 9-307 of the Uniform Commercial Code)
promptly after making such change and in any event within a reasonable period of
time prior to the date by which it is necessary under applicable Law to make any
filing in order to prevent the lapse of perfection (absent refiling) of
financing statements filed under or with respect to this Mortgage.

            Section 3.09. Inspection.

            (a) After the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been
discharged, at reasonable times (but, so long as no Default has occurred and is
continuing, no more frequently than once in any 12-month period), the Security
Trustee and its authorized representatives (the "Inspecting Parties") may
inspect the Engines (including without limitation, the Engine Documents) and the
Company shall cooperate, and shall cause any Lessee to cooperate, with the

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

Inspecting Parties in connection with any such inspection (including, without
limitation, permitting any such Inspecting Party to make copies of Engine
Documents not reasonably deemed confidential by the Company or such Lessee) at
its own cost and expense.

            (b) Any inspection of the Engines hereunder shall be limited to a
visual inspection, shall be in compliance with the Company's work and safety
rules and shall not include the disassembling, or opening of any components, of
any Engine, and no such inspection shall interfere with the Company's or any
Lessee's maintenance or use of any Engine.

            (c) With respect to such rights of inspection, the Security Trustee
shall not:

            (i) have any duty or liability to make, or any duty or liability
      arising out of, any such visit, inspection or survey or failure to make
      any such visit, inspection or survey; or

            (ii) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
      exercise its inspection rights hereunder other than on reasonable notice
      and, whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, so
      as not to unreasonably interfere with the Company's or any Lessee's
      maintenance and operation of the Aircraft and Engines.

            (d) Each person inspecting the Engines hereunder shall bear its own
expenses in connection with any such inspection, unless an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Company shall bear all
such expenses.

            (e) After the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been
discharged, if requested by the Security Trustee, the Company shall provide, or
shall cause any Lessee to provide, to the Security Trustee the date(s), if then
scheduled, upon which any Engine undergoes its next scheduled maintenance visit
and next major check and next off-the-wing maintenance, and shall advise the
Security Trustee of the name and location of the relevant maintenance performer,
if then selected, and shall, if requested by the Security Trustee in connection
with a major check, at least 5 days prior to commencement of such major check or
maintenance, make available for inspection by the Security Trustee all relevant
Engine Documents at the Company's records facility in the United States, or at
such Lessee's records facility, or at the premises of the maintenance performer.

                                   ARTICLE 4.

      REMEDIES OF THE SECURITY TRUSTEE UPON A SUBORDINATED EVENT OF DEFAULT

            Section 4.01. Remedies with Respect to Collateral.

            (a) Remedies Available. Upon the occurrence of any Subordinated
Event of Default and at any time thereafter so long as the same shall be
continuing, the Security Trustee may do one or more of the following; provided,
however, that during any period an Engine is subject to the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section

<PAGE>

                                                                              25

3.02(a) hereof and in possession of the U.S. Government, the Security Trustee
shall not, on account of any Subordinated Event of Default, be entitled to
exercise any of the following remedies in such manner as to limit the Company's
control under this Mortgage of such Engine, unless at least sixty (60) days' (or
such other period as may then be applicable under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program) written notice of such Subordinated Event of Default hereunder shall
have been given by the Security Trustee by registered or certified mail to the
Company (and any Lessee) with a copy addressed to the Contracting Office
Representative for the Air Mobility Command of the United States Air Force under
any contract with the Company (or by Lessee) relating to such Engine:

            (i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the Security
      Trustee, at the Company's expense, to deliver promptly, and the Company
      shall deliver promptly, all or any of the Engines constituting the
      Collateral at such location designated by the Security Trustee within the
      continental United States of America, together in each case with the
      Engine Documents for such Engine(s) as the Security Trustee may so demand,
      to the Security Trustee or its order, or the Security Trustee, at its
      option, may peaceably enter upon the premises where all or any of such
      Engine(s) and/or Engine Documents are located and take immediate
      possession (to the exclusion of the Company and all Persons claiming under
      or through the Company) of and remove the same by summary proceedings;

            (ii) sell all or any part of the Collateral at public or private
      sale, whether or not the Security Trustee shall at the time have
      possession thereof, as the Security Trustee may determine, or lease or
      otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral as the Security
      Trustee, in its sole discretion, may determine, all free and clear of any
      rights or claims of whatsoever kind of the Company; provided, however,
      that the Company shall be entitled at any time prior to any such
      disposition to redeem the Collateral by paying in full all of the
      Obligations;

            (iii) draw upon any Letters of Credit then held and apply such
      amounts as provided in Section 4.04 hereof; or

            (iv) exercise any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any and
      all remedies of a secured party under applicable Law.

            Upon every such taking of possession of Collateral under this
Section 4.01, the Security Trustee may, from time to time, make all such
expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations,
additions and improvements to and of the Collateral, as it may deem proper. In
each such case, the Security Trustee shall have the right to maintain, store,
lease, control or manage the Collateral and to exercise all rights and powers of
the Company relating to the Collateral in connection therewith, as the Security
Trustee shall deem best, including the right to enter into any and all such
agreements with respect to the maintenance, insurance, storage, leasing,
control, management or disposition of the Collateral or any part thereof as the
Security Trustee may determine; and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, revenues, issues, income,
products and profits of the Collateral and every part thereof, without
prejudice, however, to the right of the Security Trustee under any provision of
this Mortgage to collect and receive all cash held by, or required to be

<PAGE>

                                                                              26

deposited with, the Security Trustee hereunder. Such tolls, rents, revenues,
issues, income, products and profits shall be applied to pay the expenses of
storage, leasing, control, management or disposition of the Collateral, and of
all maintenance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements,
and to make all payments which the Security Trustee may be required or may elect
to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon
the Collateral or any part thereof (including the employment of engineers and
accountants to examine, inspect and make reports upon the properties and books
and records of the Company), and all other payments which the Security Trustee
may be required or authorized to make under any provision of this Mortgage, as
well as compensation for the services of the Security Trustee, and of all
Persons engaged and employed by the Security Trustee. If the income and proceeds
of the Collateral shall not be sufficient to pay in full the Obligations, the
Company shall be liable for any deficiency.

            In addition, the Company shall be liable for all reasonable legal
fees and other costs and expenses incurred by reason of the occurrence of any
Subordinated Event of Default or the exercise of the Security Trustee's remedies
with respect thereto, including, without limitation, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the retaking or return of any Engine in accordance
with the terms hereof or under applicable Law, which amounts shall, until paid,
be secured by the Lien of this Mortgage.

            If a Subordinated Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, at the request of the Security Trustee the Company shall promptly
execute and deliver to the Security Trustee such instruments of title and other
documents as the Security Trustee may deem necessary or advisable to enable the
Security Trustee or an agent or representative designated by the Security
Trustee, at such time or times and place or places as the Security Trustee may
specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the Collateral to which the
Security Trustee shall at the time be entitled hereunder. If the Company shall
for any reason fail to execute and deliver such instruments and documents after
such request by the Security Trustee, the Security Trustee may obtain a judgment
conferring on the Security Trustee the right to immediate possession of the
Collateral and requiring the Company to execute and deliver such instruments and
documents to the Security Trustee, to the entry of which judgment the Company
hereby specifically consents to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so.

            The Company agrees that if a Subordinated Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and only for so long as the Security Trustee is
exercising its foreclosure rights with respect to the Engines and requires use
of an engine stand owned by the Company for transporting an Engine, the Company
shall permit the Security Trustee or its agents or representatives to use such
an engine stand suitable for use with such Engine, available at the location of
such Engine and which is not otherwise being used by the Company, for the sole
purpose of transporting such Engine. The Security Trustee shall return each such
engine stand to the location from which it was taken promptly after it has
transported such Engine using such engine stand. The Security Trustee further
agrees to return each such engine stand to the Company in as good condition as
when furnished to the Security Trustee (or its agents or representatives),
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and the Security Trustee acknowledges that it
has no security interest in any such engine stand. The costs of the Security
Trustee in transporting an engine stand and restoring the condition of an engine
stand pursuant to this

<PAGE>

                                                                              27

paragraph shall be an expense of the Beneficiaries, and the Company shall have
no obligation to reimburse such expense (directly or from the proceeds of the
sale of any Collateral).

            The Company agrees that if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and only for so long as the Security Trustee is exercising its
foreclosure rights with respect to the Engines and requires use of the Company's
engine stands for transporting such Engines, the Company shall provide the
Security Trustee or its agents or representatives with full and complete access
to the use of the engine stands owned by the Company on which any Engines are
then installed or those which are not otherwise being utilized at the time of
such foreclosure. The Security Trustee agrees to return each such engine stand
used by it promptly after it has transported an Engine using such engine stand
and acknowledges that it has no security interest in any such engine stand.

            (b) Notice of Sale. The Security Trustee shall give the Company at
least fifteen (15) days' prior written notice of the date fixed for any public
sale of any Engine or of the date on or after which any private sale will be
held, which notice the Company hereby agrees is reasonable notice, and any such
public sale shall be conducted in general so as to afford the Company a
reasonable opportunity to bid.

            (c) Senior Mortgage. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, unless the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been
discharged, the Security Trustee shall not be entitled to, and shall not proceed
to foreclose the Lien of this Mortgage against any of the Collateral or
otherwise exercise any right or remedy pursuant to this Mortgage attributable to
the occurrence of a Subordinated Event of Default, unless and until the Senior
Trustee shall have exercised or concurrently be exercising one or more
dispossessory remedies under the Senior Mortgage with respect to the Engines,
and in the exercise of any of the Security Trustee's rights and remedies under
this Mortgage, the Security Trustee may not exercise any such right or remedy in
a manner inconsistent with, or otherwise in a manner which would impair or
impede or otherwise adversely affect, the exercise of the rights and remedies of
the Senior Trustee under the Senior Mortgage; it being expressly understood and
agreed that the Lien of this Mortgage on the Collateral shall at all times be
junior and otherwise subject and subordinate in all respects, to the Lien of the
Senior Mortgage.

            Section 4.02. Remedies Cumulative. Each and every right, power and
remedy herein specifically given to the Security Trustee or otherwise in this
Mortgage shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other right,
power and remedy herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law,
in equity or by statute, and each and every right, power and remedy whether
specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to
time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Security
Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any power or
remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the
time or thereafter any other right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the
Security Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in the
pursuance of any remedy shall impair any such right, power or remedy or be
construed to be a waiver of any default on the part of the Company or to be an
acquiescence therein.

            Section 4.03. Discontinuance of Proceedings. If the Security Trustee
shall have proceeded to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Mortgage
by foreclosure, entry or

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

otherwise, and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for
any reason, then and in every such case the Company and the Security Trustee
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to
the property, subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, and all rights, remedies and
powers of the Security Trustee shall continue, as if no such proceedings had
been undertaken (but otherwise without prejudice).

            Section 4.04. Allocation of Payments. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Indemnity Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Subordinated Event of Default, all amounts collected
or received by the Security Trustee or any other Secured Party on account of the
Obligations shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

            FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
      expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and
      expenses actually incurred) of the Security Trustee in connection with
      enforcing the rights of the Security Trustee under the Operative
      Documents;

            SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Security Trustee;

            THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
      expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
      expenses actually incurred by joint counsel for the Beneficiaries) of each
      of the Beneficiaries in connection with enforcing its rights under the
      Operative Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to
      such Beneficiary;

            FOURTH, to all other Obligations (other than as covered by Clause
      "FIFTH", "SIXTH" and "SEVENTH" below) which shall have become due and
      payable under the Operative Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant
      to clauses "FIRST" through "THIRD" above; and

            FIFTH, to the payment of all accrued interest on the Obligations;

            SIXTH, to the payment of the Guaranteed Amount then due and unpaid;

            SEVENTH, to be held by the Security Trustee as cash collateral
      pursuant to this Mortgage until the Lien of this Mortgage shall have been
      terminated; and

            EIGHTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be
      lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category and (ii) if amounts available are insufficient to pay all
amounts due within any category, such available amounts shall be paid pro rata
to the parties entitled thereto based upon the amount due under such category to
each such party or, in the case of Clauses FOURTH, FIFTH and SIXTH, applied
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with written instructions of
GECC.

            Section 4.05. Turnover of Payments to Senior Trustee. Until the Lien
of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged, the Security Trustee and each
Beneficiary shall

                                                                              29

hold in trust for the benefit of the "Secured Parties" (as defined in the Senior
Mortgage) and shall promptly pay to the Senior Trustee for the benefit of such
"Secured Parties" any proceeds of the Collateral for distribution in accordance
with the Senior Mortgage.

            Section 6.01. Investment of Security Funds. Any monies paid to or
received by the Security Trustee as cash collateral or which are required to be
paid to the Company or applied for the benefit of the Company (including,
without limitation, amounts payable to the Company under Sections 3.04(d),
3.04(f) and 3.05(d) hereof), but which the Security Trustee is entitled to hold
under the terms hereof pending the occurrence of some event or the performance
of some act (including, without limitation, the remedying of a Subordinated
Event of Default), shall, until paid to the Company or applied as provided
herein, be invested by the Security Trustee at the written authorization and
direction of the Company (or, if a Subordinated Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Security Trustee) from time to time at the sole
expense and risk of the Company in Permitted Investments. All Permitted
Investments held by the Security Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall
either be (a) registered in the name of, payable to the order of, or specially
endorsed to, the Security Trustee or (b) held in an Eligible Account. At the
time of such payment or application, there shall be remitted to the Company any
gain (including interest received) realized as the result of any such investment
(net of any fees, commissions, other expenses or losses, if any, incurred in
connection with such investment) unless a Subordinated Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing. The Security Trustee shall not be liable for
any loss relating to a Permitted Investment made pursuant to this Section 6.01.
The Company will promptly pay to the Security Trustee, on demand, the amount of
any loss (net of any gains, including interest received) realized as the result
of any such investment (together with any fees, commissions and other expenses,
if any, incurred in connection with such investment).

effect with insurers or reinsurers of recognized responsibility (i) "all risk"
aircraft hull insurance covering the Aircraft and the Engines, (ii) fire,
transit and extended coverage of Engines and Parts while removed from the
Aircraft and not replaced by similar components, and (iii) war risk and allied
perils insurance, including governmental confiscation and expropriation (other
than by the government of registry of the Aircraft) and hijacking insurance
(collectively, "WAR RISK INSURANCE") as contained in London form LSW 555B or its
substantive equivalent or in the case that such coverage is maintained through
the FAA, Chapter 443 of Title 49 of the United States Code as in effect on
September 1, 2004; provided, further, that the foregoing insurance shall at all
times while the Engines are subject to this Mortgage be for an amount (taking
into account self-insurance to the extent permitted by Section D) in the
aggregate applicable to all the Engines not less than the Stipulated Loss Value
of the Engines, and that when any Engine is installed on an Aircraft, the agreed
value of that Aircraft under the relevant policy shall be automatically
increased by the amount of the Stipulated Loss Value of such Engine.

            All losses will be adjusted with the insurers by the Company (giving
due regard to the interest of the Security Trustee). However, in the event that
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all losses will be adjusted
among the Company, the insurers and the Senior Trustee (if the Lien of the
Senior Mortgage shall not then have been discharged) and the Security Trustee
(if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall then have been discharged).

            As between the Security Trustee and the Company, the insurance
payments for any property damage loss to any Engine not constituting an Event of
Loss with respect thereto shall be paid, to the extent such proceeds are not
paid by the insurer(s) directly to the person effecting the repair, as follows:
all proceeds less than or equal to the Threshold Amount shall be paid to the
Company (or any Permitted Lessee if directed by the Company), and all proceeds
greater than the Threshold Amount shall be paid to the Senior Trustee (if the
Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall not then have been discharged) and to the
Security Trustee (if the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall then have been
discharged), to be held as collateral security for the Obligations, and applied
to reimburse the Company for accomplishing repairs and/or replacements as
required, or to pay suppliers directly for such repairs and/or replacements as
directed by the Company (or any Permitted Lessee if directed by the Company). In
the case of any payment to the Security Trustee (other than in respect of an
Event of Loss of an Engine), the Security Trustee shall, upon receipt of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the damage giving rise to such
payment shall have been repaired or that such payment shall then be required to
pay for repairs then being made, pay the amount of such payment, and any
interest or income earned thereon, to the Company or its order.

            2. During any period that an Aircraft or an Engine is on the ground
and not in operation, the Company may carry or cause to be carried, in lieu of

                                                                              3

paragraph 1 above, and subject to the self-insurance to the extent permitted by
Section D hereof, insurance otherwise conforming with the provisions of said
paragraph 1 except that the scope of the risks and the type of insurance shall
be consistent with industry practice for airlines operating only similar-sized
equipment on similar routes the same as from time to time applicable to aircraft
and engines owned or leased and operated by the Company (or any Permitted
Lessee) of the same or similar type which comprise the Company's (or such
Permitted Lessee's) fleet similarly on the ground and not in operation, provided
that, subject to the self-insurance to the extent permitted by Section D hereof,
the Company shall maintain or cause to be maintained insurance against risk of
loss or damage to each Engine in an amount at least equal to the Stipulated Loss
Value of such Engine during such period that such Engine is on the ground and
not in operation.

            C. Reports, Etc. The Company will furnish, or cause to be furnished,
to the Security Trustee on or before the Closing Date and annually on or before
the renewal dates of the Company's (or the Permitted Lessee's) relevant
insurance policies required hereunder, a report, signed by any reputable
recognized independent firm of insurance brokers selected by the Company, which
brokers may be regularly retained by the Company or any Permitted Lessee (the
"INSURANCE BROKER"), describing in reasonable detail the hull and liability
insurance then carried and maintained with respect to the Aircraft and the
Engines and stating the opinion of such firm that, to its knowledge, such
insurance complies with the terms of this Appendix B. Such information shall
remain confidential as provided in Section 6.12 of the Indemnity Agreement. The
Company will cause such Insurance Broker to agree to advise the Security Trustee
in writing of any default in the payment of premium and to advise the Security
Trustee at least thirty (30) days (seven (7) days in the case of War Risk
Insurance and ten (10) days in the case of nonpayment of premium) prior to the
cancellation or material adverse change of any insurance maintained pursuant to
this Appendix B, provided that, in respect of the War Risk Insurance, the
Insurance Broker shall provide for such shorter period as may be obtainable in
the international insurance market. In the event that the Company shall fail to
maintain or cause to be maintained insurance as herein provided, the Security
Trustee may, at its sole option, provide such insurance and, in such event, the
Company shall, upon demand, reimburse the Security Trustee for the cost thereof.

            D. Self-Insurance. The Company may self-insure, by way of
deductible, premium adjustment provisions in insurance policies, or otherwise,
under a program applicable to all aircraft in the Company's fleet, the risks
required to be insured against pursuant to Sections A and B hereof but in no
case shall the self-insurance with respect to all of the aircraft in the
Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft and the Engines)
exceed the lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value of any single
aircraft in the Company's fleet or (y) 1.5% of the average aggregate insurable
value (during the preceding calendar year) of all aircraft on which the Company
carries insurance, unless the Insurance Broker shall certify that the standard
among major U.S. airlines is a higher level of self-insurance, in which case the
Company may self-insure the Aircraft and the Engines to such higher level.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the insurance required by Section B.1(i) hereof
may be subject to a per occurrence deductible. With respect to the Aircraft and
the Engines when on-wing, such deductible shall be no greater than the Maximum
Self-Insurance Amount for any one occurrence. Said deductible shall not apply in
the case of a total loss of the Aircraft.

            E. Terms of Insurance Policies. Any policies carried in accordance
with Sections A and B hereof covering the Aircraft and the Engines, and any
policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any such policies, as
applicable, (1) shall name the Security Trustee and each other Secured Party
(the "Additional Insureds") as additional insureds, as their interests may
appear, (2) in the case of hull insurance, shall name the Senior Trustee (until
the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged) and the Security
Trustee (from and after the time that the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have
been discharged) as sole loss payee to the extent provided in clause (12) below,
(3) may provide for self-insurance to the extent permitted in Section D, (4)
shall provide that if the insurers cancel such insurance for any reason
whatsoever, or the same is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium or if any
material change is made in the insurance which adversely affects the interest of
any Additional Insured, such cancellation, lapse, or change shall not be
effective as to the Additional Insureds for thirty (30) days (or ten (10) days
in the case of nonpayment of premium) after issuance to (but, in the case of War
Risk Insurance, seven (7) days after sending to) the Additional Insureds of
written notice by such insurers of such cancellation or change, provided,
however, that if, the Company's War Risk Insurance provider does not provide for
provision of direct notice to Additional Insureds of cancellation, change or
lapse in the insurance required hereunder, the Company hereby agrees that, upon
receipt of notice (including any notice by publication, if applicable) of any
cancellation, change or lapse thereof from such insurance provider it shall give
the Additional Insureds immediate notice of each cancellation or lapse and
prompt notice of each change of such insurance, (5) shall provide that in
respect of the Additional Insureds' respective interests in such policies the
insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of the Company (or
any Permitted Lessee) and shall insure the respective interests of the
Additional Insureds regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty,
declaration or condition contained in such policies by the Company (or any
Permitted Lessee), (6) in the case of liability insurances, shall be primary
without any right of contribution from any other insurance which is carried by
any Additional Insured, (7) in the case of liability insurances, shall expressly
provide that all of the provisions thereof, except the limits of liability,
shall operate in the same manner as if a separate policy covered each insured,
(8) shall waive any right of subrogation of the insurers or any right of the
insurers to set-off or counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by
attachment or otherwise, in respect of any liability of any Additional Insured,
(9) shall provide that losses (other than for total loss of an Engine) shall be
adjusted with the Company (or, if an Event of Default or Special Default shall
have occurred which is continuing, with the Senior Trustee (until the Lien of
the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged) and the Security Trustee (from
and after the time that the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have been
discharged)), (10) shall provide that the Additional Insureds are not liable for
any insurance premiums, (11) shall be effective with respect to both domestic
and international operations, (12) shall provide that (i) except as specified in
clause (iii) below, in the event of a loss involving proceeds in excess of the
Threshold Amount, all proceeds in respect of such loss up to the amount of
Stipulated Loss Value for an affected Engine shall, to the extent such proceeds
are not paid by the insurer(s) directly to the person effecting the repair, be
payable to the Senior Trustee (until the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have
been discharged) and the Security Trustee (from and after the time that the Lien
of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged) to be held by Such Person
(whether such payment is made to the Company (or any Permitted Lessee) or any
third party), it being understood and agreed that in the case of any payment to
the Security Trustee otherwise than in respect of an Event of Loss of the
Engine, the

                                                                               5


Security Trustee shall, upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
that the damage giving rise to such payment shall have been repaired or that
such payment shall then be required to pay for repairs then being made or the
replacement of the Engine suffering the Event of Loss, pay the amount of such
payment, and any interest or income earned thereon, to the Company or its order,
(ii) except as specified in the following clause (iii), all proceeds less than
or equal to the Threshold Amount (regardless of the total amount of proceeds
resulting from such loss) and any proceeds of any loss in excess of Stipulated
Loss Value for the Engine suffering such loss shall be paid to the Company or
its order and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii), if a Special Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and the insurers have been notified thereof by the Security Trustee,
all proceeds of loss (other than in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value) shall
be paid to the Senior Trustee (until the Lien of the Senior Mortgage shall have
been discharged) and the Security Trustee (from and after the time that the Lien
of the Senior Mortgage shall have been discharged), (13) if separate hull and
war risk coverage is maintained, shall contain a 50/50 clause in accordance with
AVS 103, (14) shall operate on a worldwide basis subject to certain territorial
restrictions which are usual and customary in the War Risks market from time to
time and (15) shall contain a provision entitling the Security Trustee to
initiate a claim if an Event of Default shall be continuing.

            F. Reinsurance. The Company shall procure that in respect of
insurances maintained by the Company in accordance with the provisions in this
Appendix B the insurers shall maintain, if such insurances do not provide for
direct coverage in the markets hereafter referred to, reinsurance covering
identical subject matter and risk for an amount which shall not be less than
100% of the coverage amount under Sections A and B hereof in Lloyd's of London
or other internationally recognized aviation insurance and/or reinsurance
markets. Such reinsurance shall contain a customary "cut-through" endorsement
and shall provide that any payment by the reinsurers shall be made
notwithstanding any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the original
insurer and/or that the original insurer has made no payment under the original
policies.

*Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere in this Mortgage,
a lease of any Engine to an operator domiciled in any of these jurisdictions
shall be permitted only if (i) the Company and International Aero Engines, Inc.
(IAE) shall have entered into a lease with respect to such Engine that is fully
recourse to IAE, and (ii) the lease of such Engine to the operator is a sublease
from IAE to such operator. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any such
arrangement, IAE, and not the operator, would be deemed the "Lessee" or
"Permitted Lessee" as such terms are used in this Mortgage.
