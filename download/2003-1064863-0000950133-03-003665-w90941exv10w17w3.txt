         forth in Section 5.02 shall be satisfied.

                                       25

         In connection with any such increase in the Revolving Commitments,
Schedule 2.01 shall be revised to reflect the modified commitments and
commitment percentages of the Lenders, and the Borrower shall provide supporting
corporate resolutions, legal opinions, promissory notes and other items as may
be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
connection therewith.

         2.02     BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS.

         (a)      Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the
other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the
Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by
telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not
later than 11:00 a.m. (i) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, three Business
Days prior to, or (ii) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on the requested date
of, the requested date of any Borrowing, conversion or continuation. Each
telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) must be
confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan
Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(a), each Borrowing,
conversion or continuation shall be in a principal amount of (i) with respect to
Eurodollar Rate Loans, $2 million or a whole multiple of $250,000 in excess
thereof or (ii) with respect to Base Rate Loans, $1 million or a whole multiple
of $250,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written)
shall specify (i) whether such request is for a Borrowing, conversion, or
continuation, (ii) the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or
continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of
Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be
borrowed, converted or continued, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the
Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of
Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made
as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
in any Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, the Interest Period
will be deemed to be one month.

         (b)      Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the
applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is
provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of
the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the
preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the
amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on
the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of
the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (and, if such Borrowing is
the initial Credit Extension, Section 5.01), the Administrative Agent shall make
all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire
transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to
(and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower;
provided, however, that if, on the date the Loan Notice with respect to such
Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then
the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first to the payment in full of
any such L/C Borrowings and second to the Borrower as provided above.

         (c)      Except as otherwise provided herein, without the consent of
the Required Lenders, (i) a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted
only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan and
(ii) any conversion into, or continuation as, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be made
only if the conditions to Credit Extensions in Section 5.02 have been satisfied.
During the existence

                                       26

<PAGE>

of a Default or Event of Default, (i) no Loan may be requested as, converted to
or continued as a Eurodollar Rate Loan and (ii) at the request of the Required
Lenders, any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be converted immediately to
a Base Rate Loan.

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans
are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the
Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

         (e)      After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of
Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same
Type, there shall not be more than five Interest Periods in effect with respect
to Loans.

                  in Article V shall not then be satisfied and the L/C Issuer
                  shall have received written notice thereof from any Lender or

                  terminated pursuant to Section 9.02.

         (b)      Procedures for Issuance and Amendment.

                  (i)      Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as
         the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
         Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a
         Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a
         Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application
         must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not
         later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such shorter
         period as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole
         discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment,
         as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of
         a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in
         form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed
         issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a
         Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D)
         the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to
         be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F)
         the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in
         case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C
         Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any
         outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
         specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the
         Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment
         thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed
         amendment; and (4) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.

                  (ii)     Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent
         (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received
         a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if
         not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
         thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the
         Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is
         permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof,

                                       28

<PAGE>

         the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
         for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment,
         as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's
         usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance
         of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
         irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer
         a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the
         product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit.

                  (iii)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit
         or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
         thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver
         to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy
         of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

         (c)      Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                  (i)      Upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the L/C
         Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.
         Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer
         under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the
         Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative
         Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower
         fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative
         Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount
         of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount
         of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Borrower
         shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (or,
         to the extent the Borrower has given appropriate notice pursuant to
         Section 2.02(a), Eurodollar Rate Loans) to be disbursed on the Honor
         Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to
         the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal
         amount of such Loans, the amount of the unutilized portion of the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments or the conditions set forth in Section
         5.02. Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent
         pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if
         immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an
         immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding
         effect of such notice.

                  (ii)     Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C
         Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds
         available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
         at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata
         Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
         Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
         whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each
         Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a
         Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.
         The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C
         Issuer.

                  (iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
         fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans for any reason, the
         Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C
         Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so
         refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
         (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.
         In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for
         the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be
         deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing
         and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of
         its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.

                                       29

<PAGE>

                  (iv)     Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C
         Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer
         for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of
         such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
         account of the L/C Issuer.

                  (v)      Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
         Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be
         absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
         circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
         defense or other right that such Lender may have against the L/C
         Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B)
         the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default, (C)
         non-compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 5.02, or (D)
         any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any
         of the foregoing. No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
         otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C
         Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any
         Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

                  (vi)     If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount
         required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
         of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii),
         the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting
         through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the
         date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer
         at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time
         in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender
         (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing
         under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment
         under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such
         Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
         Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account
         of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed
         Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or
         otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
         Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
         Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case
         of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
         Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those
         received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Administrative Agent
         for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is
         required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
         Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
         L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata
         Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest
         thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
         returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect.

         (e)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to
repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement
under all circumstances, including the following:

                                       30

<PAGE>

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter
         of Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
         relating thereto;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off,
         defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against
         any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any
         Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
         acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with
         this Credit Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
         Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or
         any unrelated transaction;

                  (iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document
         presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
         transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                  (iv)     any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of
         Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment
         made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person
         purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
         assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
         representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of
         such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any
         proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                  (v)      any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
         circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
         a discharge of, the Borrower.

         The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

         (f)      Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that,
in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have
any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,
certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the
L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with
the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any
action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to,
and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it
may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the
respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be
liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C

                                       31

<PAGE>

Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but
only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary,
damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C
Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face
to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove
to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g)      Cash Collateral. (i) If the L/C Issuer has honored any full or
partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted
in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the L/C Expiration Date, any Letter of
Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn,
the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of
all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as
of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the L/C Expiration Date, as the case may
be). For purposes hereof, "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with
or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and
the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account
balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to
by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The
Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts
and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral
shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of
America.

         (h)      Designation of other Credit Parties as Account Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a Letter of Credit
issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter of
Credit is issued for the account of a Credit Party other than the Borrower,
provided that, notwithstanding such statement, the Borrower shall be the actual
account party for all purposes of this Credit Agreement for such Letter of
Credit and such statement shall not affect the Borrower's reimbursement
obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.

         (i)      Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued
(including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i)
the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the
Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof
as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter
of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision
published by the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998
regarding the European single currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial
Letter of Credit.

         (j)      Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay Letter of Credit
fees as set forth in Section 2.09.

         (k)      Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of
any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

         2.04     ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO SWING LINE LOANS.

                                       32

<PAGE>

         (a)      Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made
upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to
be borrowed, which shall be a minimum principal amount of $500,000 and integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, (ii) the requested borrowing date,
which shall be a Business Day, and (iii) the maturity requested therefor. Each
such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line
Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after
receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Loan Notice, the Swing Line
Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)
that the Administrative Agent has also received such Loan Notice and, if not,
the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received
notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at
the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing
Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line
Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in this Article II, or (B) that
one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article V is not then
satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line
Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such
Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower by
crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in
immediately available funds.

         (b)      Refinancing.

                  (i)      The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and
         absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which
         hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on
         its behalf), that each Lender make a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate
         Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of Swing Line
         Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which
         written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes
         hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02,
         without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the
         principal amount of Base Rate Loans, the unutilized portion of the
         Aggregate Commitments or the conditions set forth in Section 5.02. The
         Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the
         applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the
         Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro
         Rata Share of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the
         Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of
         the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office not later
         than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon,
         subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds
         available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan that is a Base
         Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent
         shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
         refinanced by such a Borrowing of Revolving Loans in accordance with
         Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Revolving Loans submitted by the
         Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request
         by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk
         participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender
         pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of
         such participation.

                  (iii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any
         amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section
         2.04(c)(i), the Swing

                                       33

<PAGE>

         Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting
         through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the
         date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line
         Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
         time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any
         Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts
         owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest
         error.

                  (iv)     Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant
         to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
         not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off,
         counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may
         have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person
         for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a
         Default or Event of Default, (C) non-compliance with the conditions set
         forth in Section 5.02, or (D) any other occurrence, event or condition,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. No such purchase or
         funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with
         interest as provided herein.

         (c)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded
         a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
         receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line
         Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such
         payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to
         reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk
         participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the
         Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in
         respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
         be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances
         described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
         entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender
         shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand
         of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
         such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make
         such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.

         (d)      Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line
Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing
Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or risk participation
pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any
Swing Line Loan, interest in respect thereof shall be solely for the account of
the Swing Line Lender.

         (e)      Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall
make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans
directly to the Swing Line Lender.

         2.05     REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

         (a)      Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on
the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
outstanding on such date.

                                       34

<PAGE>

         (b)      Swing Line Loans. The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line
Loan on the earliest to occur of (i) the maturity date agreed to by the Swing
Line Lender for such Swing Line Loan and (ii) the Termination Date.

         2.06     PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      Voluntary Prepayments.

                  (i)      Revolving Loans. The Loans may be repaid in whole or
         in part without premium or penalty (except, in the case of Loans other
         than Base Rate Loans, amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.05);
         provided that (i) notice thereof must be received by 11:00 a.m. by the
         Administrative Agent (A) at least three Business Days prior to the date
         of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (B) on the Business Day of
         prepayment of Base Rate Loans, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in
         a minimum principal amount of $2 million and integral multiples of $1
         million in excess thereof, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and a
         minimum principal amount of $1 million and integral multiples of
         $250,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Base Rate Loans, or, in each
         case, the entire principal amount thereof, if less. Each such notice of
         voluntary repayment hereunder shall be irrevocable and shall specify
         the date and amount of prepayment and the Loans and Types of Loans
         which are to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will give prompt
         notice to the applicable Lenders of any prepayment on the Loans and the
         Lender's interest therein. Prepayments of Eurodollar Rate Loans
         hereunder shall be accompanied by accrued interest thereon and breakage
         amounts, if any, under Section 3.05.

                  (ii)     Swing Line Loans. The Borrower may, upon notice to
         the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any
         time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole
         or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice
         must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent
         not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment and (B) any such
         prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $500,000. Each
         such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If
         such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such
         prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due
         and payable on the date specified therein.

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i)      Revolving Commitments. If at any time (A) the
         aggregate principal amount of Total Outstandings shall exceed the
         Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, (B) the aggregate principal
         amount of L/C Obligations shall exceed the L/C Sublimit, (C) the
         aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans shall exceed the Swing
         Line Committed Amount, prompt (and in any event within five days)
         prepayment will be made on the Revolving Loans and/or Swing Line Loans
         and/or to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to
         such excess; provided, however, that L/C Obligations will not be Cash
         Collateralized hereunder until the Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans
         have been paid in full.

                  (ii)     Asset Dispositions and Extraordinary Receipts. The
         Revolving Obligations shall be promptly, and in any event within five
         days, prepaid as hereafter provided in an amount equal to 100% of the
         Net Cash Proceeds received from any Asset Disposition and Extraordinary
         Receipts to the extent (A) such Net Cash Proceeds are not reinvested or
         committed to be reinvested in the same or similar property or assets or
         in Permitted Acquisitions within nine months of the date of such Asset
         Disposition or Extraordinary Receipts, and (B) the aggregate amount of
         such Net Cash Proceeds not reinvested in accordance with clause (A)
         shall exceed $4 million in any fiscal year.

                                       35

                  (iv)     Equity Transactions. The Revolving Obligations shall
         be promptly, and in any event within five days, prepaid as hereafter
         provided in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received
         from any Equity Transaction (other than up to $125 million in Net Cash
         Proceeds received from the Follow-On Offering).

         (c)      Application. Prepayments shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
interests therein. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied to the Obligations as
specified by the Borrower or, if not so specified, first to Base Rate Loans,
then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities and then
to a cash collateral account to secure L/C Obligations. Mandatory prepayments
shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans, then to Eurodollar Rate Loans in
direct order of Interest Period maturities and then to a cash collateral account
to secure L/C Obligations; provided that mandatory prepayments in respect of the
Revolving Commitments under subsection (b)(i) above shall be applied to the
respective Obligations as appropriate.

         2.07     TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

         (a)      Voluntary Reductions. The Commitments hereunder may be
permanently reduced in whole or in part by notice from the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent; provided that (i) any such notice thereof must be received
by 11:00 a.m. at least three Business Days prior to the date of reduction or
termination and any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $2
million and integral multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof; and (ii) the
Commitments may not be reduced to an amount less than the Total Outstandings.
The Administrative Agent will give prompt notice to the Lenders of any such
reduction in Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be
applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share
thereof. All commitment or other fees accrued until the effective date of any
termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of
such termination.

         (b)      Termination of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on
the Termination Date.

         2.08     INTEREST.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Percentage; (ii) each Loan
that is a Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate plus the Applicable Percentage; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
Percentage.

         (b)      If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Credit
Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods),
whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall
thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times
equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
Furthermore, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the Borrower shall, upon request of the Required Lenders, pay interest
on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a
fluctuating

                                       36

<PAGE>

interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due
amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
demand.

         (c)      Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

         2.09     FEES.

         (a)      Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
commitment fee equal to the Applicable Percentage of the actual daily amount by
which the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount exceeds the sum of (i) the
Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans plus (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
Obligations. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the
Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September
and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing
Date, and on the Termination Date. The commitment fee shall be calculated
quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Percentage
during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by
the Applicable Percentage separately for each period during such quarter that
such Applicable Percentage was in effect. For purposes hereof, (A) Swing Line
Loans shall not be counted toward or be considered as usage of the Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount and (B) L/C Obligations shall be counted toward and
considered as usage of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount.

         (b)      Letter of Credit Fees.

                  (i)      The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
         for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a
         Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable
         Percentage multiplied by the daily maximum amount available to be drawn
         under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then
         in effect under such Letter of Credit). Such Letter of Credit fees
         shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of
         Credit fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after
         the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with
         the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of
         Credit, on the L/C Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there
         is any change in the Applicable Percentage during any quarter, the
         daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and
         multiplied by the Applicable Percentage separately for each period
         during such quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in effect.

                  (ii)     Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges
         Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
         Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (A) with respect to each
         standby Letter of Credit, equal to 1/8 of 1% per annum multiplied by
         the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
         Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
         Letter of Credit) payable on the first Business Day after the end of
         each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first
         such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit and on
         the L/C Expiration Date, and (B) with respect to each commercial Letter
         of Credit, equal to 1/8 of 1% on the daily maximum amount available to
         be drawn under such Letter of Credit at the time of issuance. In
         addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own
         account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other
         processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the

                                       37

<PAGE>

         L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in
         effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and
         payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

         (c)      Other Fees.

                  (i)      The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the
         Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the
         amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall
         be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason
         whatsoever.

                  (ii)     The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as
         shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at
         the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and
         shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

         2.10     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime
rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall
be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in
more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis
of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the
Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the
day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is
repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a),
bear interest for one day.

         2.11     PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

         (a)      All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in
Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date
specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each
Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such
payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall
be deemed received on the immediately succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

         (b)      Subject to the definition of "Interest Period," if any payment
to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

         (c)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such
payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make
available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds, then:

                  (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
         portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender
         in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
         respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
         available by the Administrative

                                       38

<PAGE>

         Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the
         Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal
         Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                  (ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by
         the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the
         applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower
         shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with
         interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
         to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing
         herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
         fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights that the
         Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
         result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

         (d)      If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent
funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such
funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without
interest.

         (e)      The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to
fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and
not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such
participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase
its participation.

         (f)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         (g)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by or are
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C
Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied as
set forth in Section 9.02.

         2.12     SHARING OF PAYMENTS. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or
the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it
(excluding any amounts applied by the Swing Line Lender to outstanding Swing
Line Loans), any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise
of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other
share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify
the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders
such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in
the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the
case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as

                                       39

<PAGE>

the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or
any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing
Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its
discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor,
together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according
to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment
to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 11.09) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep
records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error)
of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a
participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have
the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other
communications under this Credit Agreement with respect to the portion of the
Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were
the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

         2.13     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a)      The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced
by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. The Borrower shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Note for each Lender, which shall
evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each
Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

         (b)      In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases
and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained
by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent
shall control in the absence of manifest error.

                                   ARTICLE III
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01     TAXES.

         (a)      Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Credit Document shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or

                                       40

<PAGE>

similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the
case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured
by its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net
income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under
the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
is organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall
be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Credit Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
in accordance with applicable Law, and (iv) within thirty days after the date of
such payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which
shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof.

         (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made under any Credit
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Credit Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c)      If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes
or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Credit Document
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

         (d)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii)
amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including
additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses and any costs related to the
defense of a lawsuit or other action, whether brought by a Credit Party or any
other party) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or
not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority.

         3.02     ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Loans that are Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar
Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination
no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand
from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if
applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans,
either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the

                                       41

<PAGE>

Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation
will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of
such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

         3.03     INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders
determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan,
the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of
the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have
converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Loans that are Base
Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

         3.04     INCREASED COST; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         (a)      If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's
compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as
the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction
in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of
the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased
costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of
which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve
requirements utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate, then from
time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

         (b)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to
time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

         3.05     FUNDING LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:

                  (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment
         of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than
         the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue
         or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the
         amount notified by the Borrower; or

                                       42

<PAGE>

                  (c)      any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day
         other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of
         a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.16;

including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of
funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the
deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any
customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the
foregoing.

         For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the
Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each
Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a
matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market
for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

         3.06     MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

         (a)      A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such
Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Payment of
amounts due under this Article III shall be made within thirty days after the
date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

         (b)      Upon any Lender's making of a claim for compensation under
Section 3.01 or 3.04, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 11.16.

         3.07     SURVIVAL LOSSES. All of the Borrower's obligations under this
Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment
of all other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                    GUARANTY

         4.01     THE GUARANTY.

         (a)      Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees
to each Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender party to a Swap Contract with a
Credit Party (to the extent permitted hereunder), and the Administrative Agent,
as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt
payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby
further agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a
mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and
severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and
that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the
Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at
extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory
cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such
extension or renewal.

         (b)      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein
or in any other of the Credit Documents or Swap Contracts, the obligations of
each Guarantor under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render
such

                                       43

<PAGE>

obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable
provisions of any applicable state law.

         4.02     OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of the Guarantors
under Section 4.01 are joint and several, absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability
of any of the Credit Documents or Swap Contracts, or any other agreement or
instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, impairment or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, irrespective of any other
circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this
Section 4.02 that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that
such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or
contribution against the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under
this Article IV until such time as the Obligations have been irrevocably paid in
full and the Commitments have expired or terminated. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or
impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

                  (a)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance
         shall be waived;

                  (b)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         any of the Credit Documents, any Swap Contract between any Credit Party
         and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Swap Contracts
         shall be done or omitted;

                  (c)      the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be
         accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented
         or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Credit
         Documents, any Swap Contract between any Credit Party and any Lender,
         or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument
         referred to in the Credit Documents or such Swap Contracts shall be
         waived or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security
         therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part
         or otherwise dealt with;

                  (d)      any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of
         the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e)      any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void
         or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any
         creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of
         any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any
         Guarantor).

         With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby
expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all
notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under
any of the Credit Documents, any Swap Contract between any Credit Party and any
Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to in the Credit Documents or such Swap Contracts, or against any other
Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.

         4.03     REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the Guarantors under this
Article IV shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any
reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations
is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the
Obligations,

                                       44

whether as a result of any proceedings pursuant to any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative
Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment
constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any
Debtor Relief Law.

         4.04     CERTAIN WAIVERS. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor
shall have no right of recourse to security for the Obligations, except through
the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.02 and through the
exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.06. Each Guarantor
further expressly waives any right to require that any action be brought against
the Borrower or any other Credit Party or to require recourse to security.

         4.05     REMEDIES. The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligations may be
declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 10.02 (and shall
be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances
provided in said Section 10.02) for purposes of Section 4.01 notwithstanding any
stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing
the Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any
other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Obligations
being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the Obligations
(whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due
and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 4.01.

         4.06     RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION. The Guarantors hereby agree as among
themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor
shall have a right of contributions from each other Guarantor in accordance with
applicable Law. Such contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in
right of payment to the Obligations until such time as the Obligations have been
irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated, and
none of the Guarantors shall exercise any such contribution rights until the
Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have expired
or terminated.

         4.07     GUARANTY OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTY. The guarantee in
this Article IV is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a continuing
guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.

         The Credit Parties represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders that:

         6.01     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 7.01 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (or, as
applicable with respect to HMO Subsidiaries, SAP) consistently applied
throughout the periods covered thereby, are complete and correct in all material
respects and present fairly the financial condition (including disclosure of all
material liabilities, contingent or otherwise) and results from operations of
the entities and for the periods specified, subject in the case of interim
company-prepared statements to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of
footnotes.

         6.02     NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. Since the date of the audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, there has
been no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.03     EXISTENCE, QUALIFICATION AND POWER. Each Credit Party (a) is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority and all
requisite governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to (i)
own its assets and carry on its business and (ii) execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party, (c) is duly
qualified and is licensed and in good standing under the Laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of properties or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification or license; except in each
case referred to in clause (b)(i) and (c), to the extent that failure to do so
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.04     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each member of the Consolidated Group is
in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all Medical
Reimbursement Programs and all Laws (including all HMO Regulations, Medicare
Regulations and Medicaid Regulations) and all orders, writs, injunctions,
settlements or other agreements with any Governmental Authority and decrees
applicable to it or to its properties, except in such instances in which (a)
such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree is being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted or (b) the failure
to comply therewith would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
with respect to each member of the Consolidated Group:

                  (i)      there is (A) no member of the Consolidated Group or
         individual employed by any member of the Consolidated Group that would
         reasonably be expected to have criminal culpability or to be excluded
         from participation in any Medical Reimbursement Program for corporate
         or individual actions or failures to act where such culpability or
         exclusion has resulted

                                       49

<PAGE>

         or could reasonably be expected to result in an Exclusion Event; and
         (B) no officer continuing to be employed by the Consolidated Group who
         may reasonably be expected to have individual culpability for matters
         under investigation by the OIG or other Governmental Authority unless
         such officer has been, within a reasonable period of time after
         discovery of such actual or potential culpability, either suspended or
         removed from positions of responsibility related to those activities
         under challenge by the OIG or other Governmental Authority;

                  (ii)     current billing policies, arrangements, protocols and
         instructions comply with requirements of Medical Reimbursement Programs
         and are administered by properly trained personnel, except where any
         such failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to result in an
         Exclusion Event; and

                  (iii)    current medical director compensation arrangements
         comply with state and federal anti-kick back, fraud and abuse, and
         Stark I and II requirements, except where any such failure to comply
         would not reasonably be expected to result in an Exclusion Event.

         6.05     AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Credit Party of each Credit Document to which such Person is
party, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
organizational action, and do not (a) contravene the terms of any of such
Person's Organization Documents; (b) conflict with or result in any breach or
contravention of, or the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
under, (i) any Contractual Obligation to which such Person is a party or (ii)

(except (a) as have already been obtained, (b) such filings as are necessary in
connection with the perfection of the Liens created by such Credit Documents and
(c) with respect to the exercise of the rights and remedies under the Pledge
Agreement, applicable regulatory requirements).

         6.07     BINDING EFFECT. This Credit Agreement and each other Credit
Document has been duly executed and delivered by each Credit Party that is party
thereto. This Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of such Credit Party, enforceable against such
Credit Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable Debtor Relief Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is
sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

         6.08     LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits, investigations,
criminal prosecutions, civil investigative demands, imposition of criminal or
civil fines or penalties, proceedings, claims or disputes pending or, to the
knowledge of the Credit Parties after due and diligent investigation,

Authority, by or against the any member of the Consolidated Group or against any

of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (b) would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Set forth on Schedule 6.08 is a
summary of all actions, suits, investigations, criminal prosecutions, civil

                                       50

revenues, and none of such actions, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.09     NO DEFAULT. No member of the Consolidated Group is in default
under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation that, either individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would
result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document.

         6.10     OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Each member of the Consolidated
Group (a) has good record and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest
in, all material real property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of its
business, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its other
material property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien, except for
Permitted Liens, and (b) has obtained all material licenses, permits, franchises
or other certifications, consents, approvals and authorizations, governmental or
private, necessary to the ownership of its Property and to the conduct of its
business.

         6.11     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each member of the Consolidated Group
owns, or has the legal right to use, all United States trademarks, tradenames,
copyrights, patents, technology, know-how and processes, if any, necessary for
each of them to conduct its business as currently conducted (the "Intellectual
Property") except for those the failure to own or have such legal right to use
would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Set forth on
Schedule 6.11 is a list of all patents, patent applications, trademarks,
trademark applications and registered copyrights owned or used by any member of
the Consolidated Group. No claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person
challenging or questioning the use by any member of the Consolidated Group of
any of its Intellectual Property or the validity or enforceability of any such
Intellectual Property, nor does any Credit Party know of any such threatened
claim, and to the best knowledge of the Credit Parties, the use of such
Intellectual Property by the members of the Consolidated Group does not infringe
on the rights of any Person, except for such claims and infringements that, in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         6.12     NO BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS. No applicable Law or Contractual

reports required to be filed, and have paid (a) all amounts shown therein to be
due (including interest and penalties) and (b) all other taxes, fees,
assessments and other governmental charges (including mortgage recording taxes,
documentary stamp taxes and intangibles taxes) owing, except for such taxes that
are not yet delinquent or as are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings diligently conducted and for which adequate reserves determined in
accordance with GAAP have been established, unless the failure to make any such
payment could give rise to an immediate right to foreclose on a Lien securing
such amounts. No tax claim or assessment has been asserted against members of
the Consolidated Group that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         6.14     ERISA COMPLIANCE.

         (a)      Except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Plan is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Internal Revenue
Code and other federal or state Laws, (ii) each Plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter is
currently pending before the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best knowledge
of the Borrower, nothing has occurred that would prevent, or cause the loss of,
such qualification and (iii) the Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made all
required contributions to

                                       51

to any Plan.

         (b)      There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the

occur; (ii) no Pension Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability; (iii) neither
the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to
incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan
(other than premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA); (iv)
neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects
to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred that, with the giving of
notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability) under
Sections 4201 or 4203 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan; and (v)
neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that

         6.15     MARGIN REGULATIONS; PUHCA; INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; REPORTABLE
TRANSACTIONS.

         (a)      The Credit Parties are not engaged and will not engage,
principally or as one of their important activities, in the business of
purchasing or carrying "margin stock" (within the meaning of Regulation U issued
by the FRB), or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
margin stock. Following the application of the proceeds of each Borrowing or
drawing under each Letter of Credit, not more than 25% of the value of the
assets (either of the Borrower only or of the Consolidated Group on a
consolidated basis) will be margin stock.

         (b)      None of the Credit Parties, any Person Controlling a Credit
Party, or any Subsidiary (i) is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, or (ii) is or is required to be registered
as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

         (c)      The Credit Parties do not intend to treat any of the Loans,
the Letters of Credit or any related transaction as a "reportable transaction"
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event a
Credit Party determines that it will take any action inconsistent with such
intention, it will promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof. If a Credit
Party so notifies the Administrative Agent, any Lender may treat its Loans (and
its participation interests in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans) as
subject to Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and such Lender will maintain
any lists and other records required thereby.

         6.16     SUBSIDIARIES. Set forth on Schedule 6.16, with respect to each
Credit Party, is the jurisdiction of organization, classes of Capital Stock
(including options, warrants, rights of subscription, conversion,
exchangeability and other similar rights), and ownership and ownership
percentages of each Subsidiary of such Credit Party. The outstanding shares of
Capital Stock have been validly issued, fully paid and are non-assessable and
owned free of Liens other than Permitted Liens. The outstanding shares of
Capital Stock are not subject to any buy-sell, voting trust or other shareholder
agreement except as identified on Schedule 6.16. Schedule 6.16 identifies (a)
each HMO Subsidiary and (b) each Subsidiary,

                                       52

<PAGE>

if any, that owns no assets. The Credit Parties have no Subsidiaries other than
those specifically disclosed in Schedule 6.16.

         6.17     PURPOSE OF CREDIT EXTENSIONS. The Credit Extensions will be
used by the Borrower solely for the purposes set forth in Section 7.12.

         6.18     ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. The Consolidated Group conducts in
the ordinary course of business a review of the effect of existing Environmental
Laws and claims alleging potential liability or responsibility for violation of
any Environmental Law on their respective businesses, operations and properties,
and as a result thereof the Borrower has reasonably concluded that such
Environmental Laws and claims could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.19     DISCLOSURE; NO MATERIAL MISTATEMENTS. None of the information,
reports, financial statements, exhibits or schedules, taken as a whole,
furnished by or on behalf of any member of the Consolidated Group to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of the
Credit Documents or included therein or delivered pursuant thereto contained,
contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or omitted, omits or
will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were, are or will be made, not
materially misleading, provided that to the extent any such information, report,
financial statement, exhibit or schedule was based upon or constitutes a
forecast or projection, each of the Credit Parties represents only that it acted
in good faith and utilized reasonable assumptions and due care in the
preparation of such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or
schedule, it being understood that forecasts and projections are subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Credit
Parties' control, and no assurance can be given that any forecasts or
projections will be realized.

         of the Consolidated Group pending or, to the best knowledge of the
         Credit Parties, threatened;

                  (b)      The hours worked by and payments made to employees of
         the Consolidated Group have not been in violation of the Fair Labor
         Standards Act or any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign
         law dealing with such matters in any case where a Material Adverse
         Effect would reasonably be expected to occur as a result of the
         violation thereof;

                  (c)      All payments due from members of the Consolidated
         Group, or for which any claim may be made against a member of the
         Consolidated Group, on account of wages and employee health and welfare
         insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability
         on the books of the respective members of the Consolidated Group; and

                  (d)      None of the members of the Consolidated Group is
         party to a collective bargaining agreement.

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies not Affiliates
of the Credit Parties, in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such
risks as are customarily carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and
owning similar properties in localities where the applicable member of the
Consolidated Group operates; provided that the Consolidated Group may
self-insure in accordance with normal industry practice.

         consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment,
         by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, is not in effect; or

                  (i)      ERISA. (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a
         Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or could

         (including any Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Closing Date
         in accordance with Section 7.12) or any provision thereof shall cease
         to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor (including any Person
         that becomes a Guarantor after the Closing Date in accordance with

         performed or observed pursuant to any guaranty; or

                  (k)      Invalidity of Credit Documents. Any Credit Document,
         at any time after its execution and delivery and for any reason other
         than as expressly permitted hereunder or satisfaction in full of all
         the Obligations, ceases to be in full force and effect; or any Credit
         Party or any other Person contests in any manner the validity or

         expected to materially and adversely affect such Person and such HMO
         Event shall remain unremedied for ninety days after the occurrence
         thereof (or such lesser period of time, if any, as the HMO Regulator
         administering the HMO Regulations shall have imposed for the cure of
         such HMO Event), or (ii) any HMO Subsidiary shall suffer the loss of
         25% or more of the enrolled recipients for which it is responsible
         (other than as the result of any Asset Disposition permitted hereunder)
         as measured from the beginning of the previous month or from the close
         of its immediately preceding fiscal year end that would result in a
         Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (n)      Exclusion Event. There shall occur an Exclusion Event
         that would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         9.02     REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may,
with the consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following
actions:

                  (a)      declare the commitments of the Lenders to make Loans
         and the obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to
         be terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be
         terminated;

                  (b)      declare the unpaid principal amount of all
         outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all
         other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Credit
         Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment,
         demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
         expressly waived by the Borrower;

                  (c)      require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C
         Obligations (in an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount
         thereof); and

                  (d)      exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all
         rights and remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Credit
         Documents or applicable Law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section
9.01(f) or (g), the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation
of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate,
the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other
amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the
obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as
aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         9.03     APPLICATION OF FUNDS. After the exercise of remedies provided
for in Section 9.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately
due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be
Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 9.02), any amounts
received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent in the following order:

                                       72
<PAGE>

                  First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations
         constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including
         Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III) payable to the
         Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, in each case in its
         capacity as such;

                  Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations
         constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal
         and interest) payable to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs and
         amounts payable under Article III), ratably among the Lenders in
         proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to
         them;

                  Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations
         constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and L/C
         Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective
         amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;

                  Fourth, to (a) payment of that portion of the Obligations
         constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, (b)
         payment of breakage, termination or other amounts owing in respect of
         any Swap Contract between any Credit Party and any Lender, or any
         Affiliate of a Lender, to the extent such Swap Contract is permitted
         hereunder and (c) the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
         Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of the L/C Obligations
         comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit, ratably
         among such parties in proportion to the respective amounts described in
         this clause Fourth held by them; and

                  Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have
         been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise
         required by Law.

Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fourth above shall be
applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any
amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have
either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to
the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

                                    ARTICLE X
                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         10.01    APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND
COLLATERAL AGENT.

         (a)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Credit Agreement and each other Credit Document and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by
the terms of this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed
to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Credit Agreement or any other Credit
Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and
in the other Credit Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used
merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only
an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

                                       73
<PAGE>

         (b)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes the Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Credit Agreement and each Collateral Document and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the
terms of this Credit Agreement or any Collateral Document, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any Collateral Document, the
Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein or therein, nor shall the Collateral Agent have or be
deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Credit Agreement or any Collateral Document
or otherwise exist against the Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the
Collateral Documents with reference to the Collateral Agent is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under
agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a
matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The
Collateral Agent shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any
Collateral and the Collateral Documents, and the Collateral Agent shall have all
of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this
Article X with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Collateral
Agent in connection with any Collateral or the Collateral Documents as fully as
if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the
definition of "Agent-Related Person" included the Collateral Agent with respect
to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein or in the
Collateral Documents with respect to the Collateral Agent.

         (c)      The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to
the Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the definition of
"Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
Issuer.

         10.02    DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document by or
through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice
of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         10.03    LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. No Agent-Related Person
shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
under or in connection with this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or
(b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by any Credit Party or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Credit Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Credit Agreement or any other
Credit Document, or for any failure of any Credit Party or any other party to
any Credit Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of

                                       74
<PAGE>

any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit Agreement or
any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

         10.04    RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a)      The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Credit
Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Credit Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document in accordance with a request
or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be
expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

         (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Lender that has signed this Credit Agreement
shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied
with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing
Date specifying its objection thereto.

         10.05    NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest
and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from
a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Credit Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default." The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any
such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as may be directed by the requisite Lenders in
accordance herewith; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative
Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the
best interest of the Lenders.

         10.06    CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and
all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Credit
Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other Credit

                                       75
<PAGE>

Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates that may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.

         10.07    INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on
behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the obligation of any Credit
Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however,
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of
any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other
Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the
extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or
on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations
and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         10.08    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Bank of
America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the
account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other
business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective Affiliates as
though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Credit Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent
shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect
to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Credit Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as
though it were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms
"Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

         10.09    SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty days' notice to the Lenders; provided
that any such resignation by Bank of America shall also constitute its
resignation as Collateral Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender. If the
Administrative Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the Required Lenders
shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the
Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the
Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of

                                       76
<PAGE>

Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the
Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender and the respective terms "Administrative
Agent," "Collateral Agent," "L/C Issuer" and "Swing Line Lender" thereafter
shall mean such successor administrative agent, collateral agent, Letter of
Credit issuer and swing line lender, and the retiring Administrative Agent's and
Collateral Agent's respective appointments, powers and duties in such capacities
shall be terminated, and the retiring L/C Issuer's and Swing Line Lender's
rights, powers and duties in such capacities shall be terminated, without any
other or further act or deed on the part of such retiring party or any other
Lender, other than the obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters
of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the
time of such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the
retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C
Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article X and Sections 11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent
under this Credit Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent by the date thirty days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the
Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as
provided for above.

         10.10    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective
of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise:

                  (a)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Obligations (other than obligations under
         Swap Contracts to which the Administrative Agent is not a party) that
         are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be
         necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
         compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and
         all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under
         Sections 2.09 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                  (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.

                                       77
<PAGE>

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

         10.11    COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS. The Lenders irrevocably
authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, at its option and
in its discretion:

                  (a)      to release any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Collateral Agent under any Credit Document (i) upon
         termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all
         Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the
         expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is sold
         or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted
         hereunder or under any other Credit Document, or (iii) subject to
         Section 11.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
         Required Lenders;

                  (b)      to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Collateral Agent under any Credit Document to the holder of
         any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 8.01(j); and

                  (c)      to release any Guarantor from its obligations under
         the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a
         transaction permitted hereunder.

         Upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent at any
time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the authority of the
Collateral Agent to release or subordinate its interest in particular property
and of the Administrative Agent to release any Guarantor from its obligations
hereunder pursuant to this Section 10.11.

         10.12    OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS. None of the Lenders or
other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Credit
Agreement as a "syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-agent," "book
manager," "lead manager," "arranger," "lead arranger" or "co-arranger" shall
have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Credit Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to
all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or
other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied,
and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in
deciding to enter into this Credit Agreement or in taking or not taking action
hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.01    AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of, or any consent to
deviation from, any provision of this Credit Agreement or any other Credit
Document shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Borrower, the
Credit Parties and the Required Lenders and acknowledged by the Administrative
Agent, and each such amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given; provided,
however, that:

                  (a)      unless also signed by each Lender directly affected
         thereby, no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

                                       78
<PAGE>

                           (i)      extend or increase the Commitment of any
                  Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to
                  Section 9.02), it being understood that the amendment or
                  waiver of an Event of Default or a mandatory reduction or a
                  mandatory prepayment in Commitments shall not be considered an
                  increase in Commitments,

                           (ii)     waive non-payment or postpone any date fixed
                  by this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document for any
                  payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to
                  any Lender hereunder or under any other Credit Document,

                           (iii)    reduce the principal of, or the rate of
                  interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or
                  any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other
                  Credit Document; provided, however, that only the consent of
                  the Required Lenders shall be necessary (A) to amend the
                  definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any obligation of the
                  Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate or (B) to amend
                  any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used
                  therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to
                  reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or L/C Borrowing or to
                  reduce any fee payable hereunder,

                           (iv)     change any provision of this Credit
                  Agreement regarding pro rata sharing or pro rata funding with
                  respect to (A) the making of advances (including
                  participations), (B) the manner of application of payments or
                  prepayments of principal, interest, or fees, (C) the manner of
                  application of reimbursement obligations from drawings under
                  Letters of Credit, or (D) the manner of reduction of
                  commitments and committed amounts,

                           (v)      change any provision of this Section
                  11.01(a) or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other
                  provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
                  Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any
                  rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any
                  consent hereunder,

                           (vi)     release all or substantially all of the
                  Collateral (other than as provided herein or as appropriate in
                  connection with transactions permitted hereunder), or

                           (vii)    release all or substantially all of the
                  Guarantors from their obligations hereunder (other than as

                  transactions permitted hereunder);

                  (b)      unless also signed by the L/C Issuer, no such
         amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties of the
         L/C Issuer under this Credit Agreement or any Letter of Credit
         Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
         it;

                  (c)      unless also signed by the Swing Line Lender, no such
         amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties of the
         Swing Line Lender under this Credit Agreement;

                  (d)      unless also signed by the Administrative Agent, no
         such amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties of
         the Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement or any other
         Credit Document; and

                  (e)      unless also signed by the Collateral Agent, no such
         amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties of the
         Collateral Agent under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit

<PAGE>

provided however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

         11.02    NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS; FACSIMILE COPIES.

         (a)      General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including by facsimile transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed,
faxed or delivered, and all notices and other communications expressly permitted
hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made, to the address, facsimile
number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified for the applicable
party on Schedule 11.02 or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic
mail address or telephone number as shall be designated by such party in a
notice to the other parties. All such notices and other communications shall be
deemed to be given or made upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by
the relevant party hereto and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand, when signed for by
or on behalf of the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by overnight courier
service, one Business Day after deposit with such service, delivery prepaid; (C)
if delivered by mail, three Business Days after deposit in the mails, postage
prepaid; (D) if delivered by facsimile, when sent and receipt has been confirmed

subject to the provisions of subsection (c) below), when delivered; provided,
however, that notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent, the
L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Article II shall not be
effective until actually received by such Person. In no event shall a voicemail
message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

         (b)      Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Credit
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually signed originals and shall be binding on all
Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
manually signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document
or signature.

         (c)      Limited Use of Electronic Mail. With respect to notices or
deliveries permitted or required hereunder, electronic mail and internet and
intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications, such as

used for any other purpose.

         (d)      Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any
notices (including telephonic Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of
the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner provided herein,
were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice
provided herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient,
varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and
liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice
purportedly given by or on behalf of the

                                       80
<PAGE>

Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other communications with the
Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

         11.03    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

         11.04    ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. The Credit Parties jointly
and severally agree (a) to pay directly to the provider thereof or to pay or
reimburse the Administrative Agent for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, the preservation of any rights
or remedies under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and any
amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and
thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including all Attorney Costs, and (b) to pay or
reimburse the Administrative Agent and each Lender for all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or
preservation of any rights or remedies under this Credit Agreement or the other
Credit Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any
"workout" or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal
proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all
Attorney Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search,
filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes
related thereto, and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and the reasonable cost of independent public accountants
and other outside experts retained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
All amounts due under this Section 11.04 shall be payable within ten Business
Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

         11.05    INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BORROWER. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents, trustees, advisors
and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney
Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever (subject to the provisions of Section
3.01 with respect to Taxes, Other Taxes and Excluded Taxes) that may at any time
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee (whether by a
Credit Party or any other party) in any way relating to or arising out of or in
connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or
administration of any Credit Document or any other agreement, letter or
instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment,
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom
(including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), or (c) any actual
or threatened claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements are determined by a court of

                                       81

<PAGE>

competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee
shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any
information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar
information transmission systems in connection with this Credit Agreement, and
no Indemnitee shall have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages
relating to this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or arising out of
its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the
Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section 11.05 shall be payable within
ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the
replacement of any Lender, the assignment by any Lender of any of its interests
hereunder, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

         11.06    PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid
by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate from time to time in effect.

         11.07    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this
Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject
to the restrictions of subsection (f) or (i) of this Section (and any other
attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).
Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in
subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Credit Agreement.

         (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including
for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in
Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case
of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment
to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a
Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes
Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of
the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5
million unless each of

                                       82

<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans or the
Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in
respect of Swing Line Loans; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be
approved by the Administrative Agent and, with respect to any assignment of a
Revolving Commitment, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the Person that is the proposed
assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would
otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a
party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released
from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04,
3.05, 11.04 and 11.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to
the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its
expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement
that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this
Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or
other modification that extends the time for, reduces the amount or alters the
application of proceeds with respect to such obligations and

                                       83

<PAGE>

payments required therein that directly affects such Participant. Subject to
subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though
it were a Lender.

         (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant.
A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 11.15 as though it were a
Lender.

         (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

         (g)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender that is a Fund may (without notice to or the consent of any of the
parties hereto) create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans
owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of
obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such
obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee actually
becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 11.07,
(i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations
under the Credit Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Credit Documents even though
such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged
interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

         (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to
subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty days' notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon thirty days'
notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such
resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled
to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender
hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any
such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or
Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer,
it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto
(including the right to require the Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are
Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall
retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with
respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date
of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in
outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

         11.08    CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information,
except that Confidential Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be

                                       84

<PAGE>

informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and
instructed to keep such Confidential Information confidential); (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by
applicable Law or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d)
to any other party to this Credit Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise
of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Credit Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section,
to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible
Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Credit Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or
prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective
counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction
relating to obligations of the Credit Parties; (g) with the consent of the
Borrower; (h) to the extent such Confidential Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower; (i) to the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization; or (j) to any
nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to a Lender's or an
Affiliate's investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect
to such Lender or Affiliate. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders may disclose the existence of this Credit Agreement and information
about this Credit Agreement to market data collectors (and similar service
providers) that track the loan syndications market, and to service providers to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration
and management of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the
Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Confidential Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
information. For the purposes of this Section, "Confidential Information" means
all information received from any Credit Party relating to any Credit Party or
its business, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by any Credit Party; provided that, in the case of information
received from a Credit Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly
identified in writing at the time of delivery as confidential. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, "Confidential Information" shall not include
any information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each
case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, and the
Administrative Agent and each Lender may disclose to any and all Persons,
without limitation of any kind (other than limitations provided by applicable
Law), any such information; provided that with respect to any document or
similar item that contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax
structure of the transaction as well as Confidential Information, this sentence
shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that relate to
the tax treatment or tax structure of the Loans, the Letters of Credit and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         11.09    SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender and each of its Affiliates are authorized at any time and
from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Credit
Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on
behalf of each Credit Party) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such
Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the respective Credit
Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under
any other Credit Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or
not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document and although such Obligations may
be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of
the applicable deposit or

                                       85

<PAGE>

indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

         11.10    INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Credit Document, the interest paid or agreed to be
paid under the Credit Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of
non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal
of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.
In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not
principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

         11.11    COUNTERPARTS. This Credit Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         11.12    INTEGRATION. This Credit Agreement, together with the other
Credit Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties
on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this Credit Agreement and those of any other Credit Document,
the provisions of this Credit Agreement shall control; provided that the
inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders in any other Credit Document shall not be deemed a conflict
with this Credit Agreement. Each Credit Document was drafted with the joint
participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither
against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair
meaning thereof.

         11.13    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Credit Document
or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith
or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or Event of Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall
continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation
hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall
remain outstanding.

         11.14    SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Credit Agreement or the
other Credit Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall not be affected or impaired
thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace
the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the
economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

         11.15    TAX FORMS.

                                       86

<PAGE>

         (a)      (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within
         the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code (a
         "Foreign Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to
         receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Internal
         Revenue Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein),
         two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any
         successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to
         an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to
         be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Credit
         Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all
         payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to
         this Credit Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is
         entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax,
         including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Internal
         Revenue Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign
         Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such
         additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or
         such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the
         relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available
         under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such
         evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States
         withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign
         Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement, (B) promptly
         notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances that
         would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and
         (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it,
         in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably
         necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid
         any requirement of applicable Law that the Borrower make any deduction
         or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

                  (ii)     Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
         ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
         sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Credit Documents
         (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender),
         shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign
         Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of
         any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be
         necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the
         reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed
         copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such
         Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums
         paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own
         account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly
         signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto),
         together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such
         form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required
         under the Internal Revenue Code, to establish that such Lender is not
         acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums
         payable to such Lender.

                  (iii)    The Borrower shall not be required to pay any
         additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with
         respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis
         of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender
         transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.15(a) or
         (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender shall
         have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date
         such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with
         respect to any payment under any of the Credit Documents, nothing in
         this Section 11.15(a) shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
         pay any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result
         of any change in any applicable Law, treaty or governmental rule,
         regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
         administration or

                                       87

<PAGE>

         application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to
         deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
         establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account
         of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Credit
         Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at
         a reduced rate.

                  (iv)     The Administrative Agent may, without reduction,
         withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any
         payment under any of the Credit Documents with respect to which the
         Borrower is not required to pay additional amounts under this Section
         11.15(a).

         (b)      Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that
is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Internal Revenue Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed
completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms,
then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such
Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by
the Internal Revenue Code, without reduction.

         (c)      If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax
or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate
Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of
the Administrative Agent.

         11.16    REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. Under any circumstances set forth
herein providing that the Borrower shall have the right to replace a Lender as a
party to this Credit Agreement, the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign
its Commitment (with the related assignment fee to be paid by the assignee or,
at its option, the Borrower) pursuant to Section 11.07(b) to one or more
Eligible Assignees procured by the Borrower. The assignee and/or the Borrower,
as appropriate, shall pay in full all principal, interest, fees and other
amounts owing to such Lender through the date of replacement (including any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.05). Any Lender being replaced shall
execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender's
Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing
Line Loans.

         11.17    SOURCE OF FUNDS. Each of the Lenders hereby represents and
warrants to the Borrower that at least one of the following statements is an
accurate representation as to the source of funds to be used by such Lender in
connection with the financing hereunder:

                  (a)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets allocated to a separate account maintained by such Lender, no
         part of such funds constitutes assets allocated to any separate account
         in which any employee benefit plan (or its related trust) has any
         interest;

                  (b)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets allocated to any separate account maintained by such Lender,
         such Lender has disclosed to the Borrower the name of each employee
         benefit plan whose assets in such account exceed 10% of the total
         assets of such account as of the date of such purchase (and, for
         purposes of this subsection (b), all employee benefit plans maintained
         by the same employer or employee organization are deemed to be a single
         plan) and such Lender is an insurance company that will comply with the
         record-keeping obligations established under Prohibited Transaction
         Class Exemption 90-1 issued by the Department of Labor;

                                       88

<PAGE>

                  (c)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets of an insurance company's general account, such insurance
         company has complied with all of the requirements of the regulations
         issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of ERISA such that such funds are not
         treated as assets of an employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA; or

                  (d)      such funds constitute assets of one or more specific
         employee benefit plans that such Lender has identified in writing to
         the Borrower.

         As used in this Section, the terms "employee benefit plan" and
"separate account" shall have the respective meanings provided in Section 3 of
ERISA.

         11.18    GOVERNING LAW.

         (a)      THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, the LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely within such State; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE
Agent, THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING
UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

         (b)      ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS
SITTING IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH CREDIT PARTY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent, THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND
EACH LENDER CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH CREDIT PARTY, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE Agent, THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND EACH LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE
GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY
CREDIT DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO. EACH CREDIT PARTY, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE Agent, THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND EACH LENDER WAIVES PERSONAL
SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, THAT MAY BE MADE BY ANY
OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.

         11.19    WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF
THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN
CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT
ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
