the iPass has unpaid invoices related to the use of CMI&rsquo;s network in China. iPass believes it does not owe CMI anything
because iPass does not have an agreement with CMI with commercial terms. iPass does have a commercial agreement with New Bridge
and has been paying New Bridge each month for many years for facilitating iPass&rsquo; usage of CMI&rsquo;s network. iPass believes
New Bridge owes CMI money, but CMI incorrectly asserts that New Bridge is a subsidiary of iPass. A representative of iPass has
