Dispute Resolution Provision only, the term &#147;parties&#148; shall include any Affiliate of the

binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code) (the
&#147;<U>Act</U>&#148;). The Act will apply even though this Agreement provides that it is governed by the
law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

rules and procedures for the arbitration of financial services disputes of the American Arbitration
Association or any successor thereof (&#147;<U>AAA</U>&#148;), and the terms of this Dispute Resolution
Provision. In the event of any inconsistency, the terms of this Dispute Resolution Provision shall
control. If AAA is unwilling or unable to (i)&nbsp;serve as the provider of arbitration or (ii)&nbsp;enforce
any provision of this arbitration clause, the Administrative Agent may designate another
arbitration organization with similar procedures to serve as the provider of arbitration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The arbitration shall be administered by AAA and conducted, unless otherwise required by
Law, in any U.S. state where Collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility is located or if there is
no such Collateral, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All Claims shall be determined by one
arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), upon the request of any
affected party hereto, the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings
shall commence within ninety (90)&nbsp;days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90)
days of commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of
the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good cause, may extend the
commencement of the hearing for up to an additional sixty (60)&nbsp;days. The arbitrator(s) shall
provide a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be
submitted to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and have judgment entered and enforced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;The arbitrator(s) will give effect to statutes of limitation in determining any Claim and
may dismiss the arbitration on the basis that the Claim is barred. For purposes of the application
of any statutes of limitation, the service on AAA under applicable AAA rules of a notice of Claim
is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or
whether a Claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s), except as set forth at
subparagraph (h)&nbsp;of this Dispute Resolution Provision. The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to
award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of
