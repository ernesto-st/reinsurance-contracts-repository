available to Borrower from time to time until the Commitment Termination Date its Pro Rata
Share of advances (each, a &#147;<U>Revolving Credit Advance</U>&#148;). The Pro Rata Share of the
Revolving Loan of any Revolving Lender shall not at any time exceed its separate Revolving
Loan Commitment. The obligations of each Revolving Lender hereunder shall be several and
not joint. Until the Commitment Termination Date, Borrower may from time to time borrow,
repay and reborrow under this <U>Section&nbsp;1.1(a)</U>; <I>provided</I>, that the amount of any
Revolving Credit Advance to be made at any time shall not exceed Borrowing Availability at
such time. Borrowing Availability may be further reduced by Reserves imposed by Agent in
its Permitted Discretion. Each Revolving Credit Advance shall be made on notice by
Borrower to one of the representatives of Agent identified in <U>Schedule&nbsp;1.1</U> at the
address specified therein. Any such notice must be given no later than (1)&nbsp;11:00&nbsp;a.m.
(Chicago time) on the Business Day of the proposed Revolving Credit Advance, in the case of
an Index Rate Loan, or (2)&nbsp;11:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on the date which is three (3)
Business Days prior to the proposed Revolving Credit Advance, in the case of a LIBOR Loan.
Each such notice (a &#147;<U>Notice of Revolving Credit Advance</U>&#148;) must be given in writing
(by telecopy or overnight courier) substantially in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;1.1(a)(i)</U>,
and shall include the information required in such Exhibit and such other information as
may be required by Agent. If Borrower desires to have the Revolving Credit Advances bear
interest by reference to a LIBOR Rate, it must comply with <U>Section&nbsp;1.5(e)</U>.

each Revolving Lender a note to evidence the Revolving Loan Commitment of that Revolving
Lender. Each note shall be in the principal amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment of the
applicable Revolving Lender, dated the Closing Date and substantially in the form of
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;1.1(a)(ii)</U> (each a &#147;<U>Revolving Note</U>&#148; and, collectively, the
&#147;<U>Revolving Notes</U>&#148;). Each Revolving Note shall represent the obligation of Borrower
to pay the amount of Revolving Lender&#146;s Revolving Loan Commitment or, if less, such
Revolving Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving
Credit Advances to Borrower together with interest thereon as prescribed in <U>Section
1.5</U>. The entire unpaid balance of the Revolving Loan and all other non-contingent
Obligations shall be immediately due and payable in full in immediately available funds on
the Commitment Termination Date.

Revolving Credit Advances to Borrower on behalf of Revolving Lenders in amounts that cause
the outstanding balance of the aggregate Revolving Loan to exceed the Borrowing Base (less
the Swing Line Loan) (any such excess Revolving Credit Advances are herein referred to
collectively as &#147;<U>Overadvances</U>&#148;); <I>provided</I>, that (A)&nbsp;no such event or occurrence

such notice. The provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;1.1(c)</U> shall not relieve Revolving

of (A)&nbsp;the Swing Line Commitment and (B)&nbsp;the lesser of the Maximum Amount and (except for
Overadvances) the Borrowing Base, in each case, less the outstanding balance of the
Revolving Loan at such time (&#147;<U>Swing Line Availability</U>&#148;). Until the Commitment
Termination Date, Borrower may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow under this
<U>Section&nbsp;1.1(c)</U>. Each Swing Line Advance shall be made pursuant to a Notice of
Revolving Credit advance delivered by Borrower to Agent in accordance with <U>Section
1.1(a)</U>. Any such notice must be given no later than 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (Chicago time) on the
Business Day of the proposed Swing Line Advance. The Swing Line Lender shall,
notwithstanding the failure of any condition precedent set forth in <U>Sections&nbsp;2.2</U>,
be entitled to fund that Swing Line Advance, and to have each Revolving Lender make
Revolving Credit Advances in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;1.1(c)(iii)</U> or purchase
participating interests in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;1.1(c)(iv)</U>. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Swing Line Loan
shall constitute an Index Rate Loan. Borrower shall repay the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Swing Line Loan upon demand therefor by Agent.

guaranteed by Agent but rather each Revolving Lender shall, subject to the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, purchase (or be deemed to have purchased) risk participations in all such
Letters of Credit issued with the written consent of Agent, as more fully described in paragraph

in no way be construed to limit the foregoing. If any &#147;Accounting Changes&#148; (as defined below)

Change with respect thereto has been implemented, any reference to GAAP contained in the Agreement

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><U><B>SCHEDULE 3.13 LITIGATION</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Legal proceedings. On November&nbsp;19, 2007, Dywidag Systems International, Inc. (&#147;DSI&#148;) filed a
third-party lawsuit in the Ohio Court of Claims alleging that certain epoxy-coated strand sold by
the Company to DSI in 2002, and supplied by DSI to the Ohio Department of Transportation (&#147;ODOT&#148;)
for a bridge project, was defective. The third-party action seeks recovery of any damages which may
be assessed against DSI in the action filed against it by ODOT, which allegedly could be in excess
of $8.3&nbsp;million, plus $2.7&nbsp;million in damages allegedly incurred by DSI. On Nov. 30, 2009, the Ohio
court granted the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss the third party claim against it on the grounds that
the statute of limitations had expired. DSI is currently attempting to take an interlocutory appeal
of this ruling If it is successful in having its appeal heard at this stage, the Company will
continue its vigorous defense of the matter. In addition, the Company had previously filed a
lawsuit against DSI in the North Carolina Superior Court in Surry County seeking recovery of $1.4
million (plus interest) owed for other products sold by the Company to DSI and a judgment declaring
that it had no liability to DSI arising out of the bridge project. The North Carolina action was
subsequently removed by DSI to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina,
where it is currently pending. DSI has filed a motion to dismiss or stay the North Carolina action
due to the pendency of the Ohio litigation. This motion, which the Company opposes, is awaiting a
ruling by the court. The Company has concluded that a loss is not yet probable with respect to this
matter, and therefore no liability has been recorded. In the event that DSI is successful in
overturning the dismissal of its claims against the Company (which we do not believe is likely), we
have estimated the potential loss could range to $11.0&nbsp;million.
