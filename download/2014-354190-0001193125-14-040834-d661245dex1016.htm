this Deferred Equity Participation Plan (the &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;) is to encourage key executives of Arthur J. Gallagher&nbsp;&amp; Co. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), to remain employed with the
Company until at least age 62. The retention of key executives promotes the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing continuity of management and leadership and by capitalizing on the investments the Company has made in its key
executives over the years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event that a Participant&#146;s Account is deemed invested in shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock, par value $1.00 per share (&#147;<U>Common Stock</U>&#148;), such shares of Common Stock will either be contributed to the trustee of the Trust (as defined below) by the Company, in which case they will be deemed to have been distributed
under the Arthur J. Gallagher&nbsp;&amp; Co. 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or any successor plan adopted by the Company and approved by its stockholders (the &#147;<U>LTIP</U>&#148;), and will count against the limit
on the number of shares of Common Stock available for distribution thereunder, or such shares shall have been purchased by the trustee of the Trust on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as a result of an irrevocable election by
the Participant, and shall not be deemed to have been distributed under the LTIP. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section&nbsp;1. Trust and Trust Funding. </B></P>

to the trust agreement dated March&nbsp;22, 2001, as amended. The Trust is intended to be a &#147;grantor trust&#148; under the Code and the establishment of the Trust or the utilization of the Trust for Plan benefits, as applicable, is not intended
to cause any Participant to realize current income on amounts contributed thereto, and the Trust shall be so interpreted. Any such funds will be subject to the claims of all bankruptcy or insolvency creditors of the Company as provided in the Trust
agreement. No Participant will have any vested interest or secured or preferred position with respect to such funds or have any claims against the Company hereunder except as a general creditor. </P>

(ii)&nbsp;cash, in either case in an amount approved by the Compensation Committee (the &#147;<U>Committee</U>&#148;) of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (such contribution, the &#147;<U>Annual Funding</U>&#148;). Alternatively, the Company may
contribute cash to the Trust and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares or a specified value of shares of Common Stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Committee shall exercise all rights of
ownership, including voting control, of the Trust assets prior to distribution under the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Interrelationship of the Plan and
the Trust</U>. The provisions of the Plan shall govern the rights of a Participant to receive distributions pursuant to the Plan. The provisions of the Trust shall govern the rights of the Company, the Participants and the creditors of the Company
to the assets transferred to the Trust. </P>

Participant&#146;s Account (with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer&#146;s allocation). The Committee shall determine the allocation of the Annual Funding to be awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and shall review the list provided by
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether to adjust the list of Participants and the proposed allocation of the Annual Funding to be credited to each such Participant&#146;s Account. The
Committee shall make the final determination regarding the allocation of the Annual Funding to be credited to each such Participant&#146;s Account. Receiving an allocation under the Plan in any year does not in any way entitle the Participant to
receive an allocation in any future year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Earnings</U>. The Committee shall establish from time to time the hypothetical

add one or more additional Investments under the Plan. In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may discontinue any Investment at any time, and provide for the portions of Participants&#146; Accounts designated to the discontinued
Investment to be reallocated to another Investment. While a Participant&#146;s Account does not represent the Participant&#146;s ownership of, or any ownership interest in, any particular assets, the Participant&#146;s Account shall be adjusted in
accordance with the Investment(s), subject to the conditions and procedures set forth herein or established by the Committee from time to time. Any notional cash earnings generated under an Investment (such as interest and cash dividends and
distributions) shall, at the Committee&#146;s sole discretion, either be deemed to be reinvested in that Investment or reinvested in one or more other Investment(s) designated by the Committee. All notional acquisitions and dispositions of
Investments under a Participant&#146;s Account shall be deemed to occur at such times as the Committee shall determine to be administratively feasible in its sole discretion and the Participant&#146;s Account shall be adjusted accordingly. In
addition, a Participant&#146;s Account may be adjusted from time to time, in accordance with procedures and practices established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect any notional transactional costs and other fees and expenses
relating to the deemed investment, disposition or carrying of any Investment for the Participant&#146;s Account. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section&nbsp;3.
