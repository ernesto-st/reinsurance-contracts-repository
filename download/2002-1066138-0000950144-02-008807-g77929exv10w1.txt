         Re:      Commitment to provide first mortgage financing in the
                  aggregate amount of $286,200,000 (the "LOAN") to a special
                  purpose entity (the "BORROWER"), to be owned and controlled by
                  Lodgian Inc. (the "COMPANY") following its reorganization
                  -------------------------------------------------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         On December 20, 2001, the Company filed a voluntary petition for relief
under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the "BANKRUPTCY Code")
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
"BANKRUPTCY COURT") and has since continued in the operation of its business and
the management of its properties as a debtor-in-possession pursuant to sections
1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company has informed us that it is
currently exploring exit financing alternatives as part of a proposed Plan of
Reorganization (the "PROPOSED PLAN") that it anticipates filing with the
Bankruptcy Court in July, 2002. The Proposed Plan will contemplate, among other
things, refinancing (i) an existing $195,600,000 first mortgage loan made by a
bank syndicate led by Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers and secured by mortgage
liens on 50 hotels (the "MSLB HOTELS") and (ii) two mortgage loans in the
aggregate principal amount of $60,600,000 held by Rockbridge Capital, Inc. and
secured by mortgage liens on six hotels (the "ROCKBRIDGE HOTELS"; the MSLB
Hotels and the Rockbridge Hotels, collectively, the "PORTFOLIO HOTELS").

                  Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital Inc. and/or its affiliates
("MERRILL LYNCH" or the "LENDER") are pleased to commit to provide the Loan on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Summary of
Principal Terms (the "SPT") attached hereto. The obligation of the Lender to
make the Loan is subject to, among the other conditions set forth herein and in
the SPT, the following: (i) the preparation, execution and delivery of a loan
agreement (the "LOAN AGREEMENT") and other loan documents (collectively,
together with the Loan Agreement, the "LOAN DOCUMENTS") reasonably acceptable to
the Lender and incorporating substantially the terms and conditions set forth
herein and in the SPT; (ii) actual EBITDA of the Portfolio Hotels, measured on a
cumulative basis for the period from July 1,


<PAGE>
2002 through the Closing (as defined in the SPT) shall not be less than 90% of
EBITDA of the Portfolio Hotels for the same period, as set forth in the
Company's budget (the "BUDGET"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule
1, and all calculations of EBITDA shall employ the same methodology as is
employed in the Budget; (iii) the Lender's reasonable determination that there
has been no material adverse change since the date of this commitment letter in
the United States hospitality sector due to acts of terrorism, declaration by
the United States of war or national emergency or the outbreak or escalation of
other hostilities involving the United States in the United States or abroad;
(iv) as of Closing (a) Portfolio Hotels assigned not less than 75% of the
aggregate of the percentages (the "ASSIGNED PERCENTAGES") of the total value of
the Portfolio Hotels assigned to the individual Portfolio Hotels, as set forth
on Schedule 2, must be operated under franchise agreements with Six Continents
and Marriott, and (b) Portfolio Hotels assigned not more than 10% of the
aggregate of the Assigned Percentages are operated without franchise agreements
with nationally-recognized hotel franchises; (v) as of Closing, the total number
of hotel rooms in the Portfolio Hotels having failing scores under franchise
agreements, other than failing scores under agreements with Six Continents
resulting from failing guest service scores under Six Continents' revised
scoring system ("EXCLUDED FAILING SCORES"), shall not exceed the sum of (a) the
number of hotel rooms having failing scores, other than Excluded Failing Scores,
as of the date of this commitment letter and (b) 10% of the total number of
hotel rooms in the Portfolio Hotels; and (vi) not more than 10% (by appraised
value) of the rooms constituting the Portfolio Hotels are unavailable due to
casualty.

         The Company shall continue to actively assist the Lender in connection
with the underwriting of the Loan, and, in connection therewith, shall provide
and cause its advisors to provide the Lender upon request with all information
reasonably requested and otherwise to assist the Lender in its underwriting
efforts, including making available officers and advisors of the Company from
time to time to attend and make presentations regarding the Proposed Plan and
the business and prospects of the Company and the Portfolio Hotels, as
appropriate, at a meeting or meetings with the Lender. From the date of this
commitment letter until the earlier of (i) its termination and (ii) the 70th day
after the Company's timely acceptance of this commitment letter, the Company
shall refrain from engaging or soliciting any prospective lender to provide
financing with respect to any of the Portfolio Hotels. In addition, if the
Company determines to engage a financial advisor, in addition to its currently
engaged advisors and the current scope of their engagement, with respect to the
sale, financing or refinancing of all or any portion of the Company, its
operations or assets, the Company shall, to the extent practicable, afford
appropriate affiliates of the Lender an opportunity to be considered for such
engagement(s) comparable to that afforded other prospective advisors.

         The Company recognizes that the Lender has not had the opportunity to
complete its legal due diligence, including its review of franchise
arrangements, or to conduct certain structural and environmental evaluations of
the Portfolio Hotels. The Lender's obligation to make the Loan is subject to the
Lender's satisfaction with (i) all third party reports with respect to the
Portfolio Hotels that the Lender shall reasonably require, including, without
limitation, appraisals, structural and environmental reports and title reports
(the "THIRD PARTY REPORTS"), and (ii) all legal due diligence items that the
Lender shall reasonably require with respect to the Portfolio Hotels, the
Borrower and the Company, including, without limitation, all management
agreements, franchise agreements, ground leases, space leases and filings in
pending litigation (the "LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE ITEMS"). The Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to arrange for its receipt


                                       2
<PAGE>
of the Third Party Reports not later than the 60th day following the Company's
timely acceptance of this commitment letter. The Company shall promptly, and in
any event within 10 days after receipt of the Lender's written request, make
available to the Lender copies of requested Legal Due Diligence Items. If and
when the Lender has determined to approve, for the purpose of satisfying the
corresponding conditions to the making of the Loan, all Third Party Reports and
all Legal Due Diligence Items (other than Legal Due Diligence Items that the
Company has failed to make available as required above), the Lender shall
deliver to the Company written notice (the "DILIGENCE COMPLETION NOTICE"), which
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in the SPT. Following the 84th day
(the "DUE DILIGENCE CUT-OFF DATE") after the Company's timely acceptance of this
commitment letter, if the Lender has not delivered to the Company the Diligence
Completion Notice on or before the Due Diligence Cut-off Date, the Company may,
by written notice delivered to the Lender at any time thereafter terminate this
commitment letter, and the obligations of the parties hereunder (other than the
Company's obligations to pay the expenses required by the seventh paragraph of
this commitment letter). The Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of any
findings from the Lender's review of the Third Party Reports and Legal Due
Diligence Items that the Lender believes, individually or in the aggregate,
would cause a failure of a condition precedent to the making of the Loan to be
satisfied.

         With the cooperation of the Borrower, the Lender shall coordinate with
the Borrower's counsel in engaging the service providers that will prepare Third
Party Reports, all of which shall be addressed to the Lender and the Company.
The Lender recognizes that all Third Party Reports are the property of the
Company and may be made available to the Company and any party authorized by the
Company, subject to the second sentence of the third paragraph of this
commitment letter.

         The Company hereby represents, warrants and covenants that (i) all
information, other than the Projections (as defined below), that it or its
representatives have made or hereafter make available to the Lender in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "INFORMATION"), when
taken as a whole, is and will be complete and correct in all material respects
and does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein
not misleading and (ii) all financial projections it or its representatives have
made or hereafter make available to the Lender (the "PROJECTIONS") have been and
will be prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions. The Company
shall furnish the Lender with such Information and Projections as the Lender may
reasonably request and to supplement the Information and the Projections from
time to time until the closing date for the Loan so that the representation and
warranty in the preceding sentence is correct on such closing date. The Company
acknowledges that, in underwriting the Loan, the Lender has used and relied on
and will be using and relying on the Information and the Projections without
independent verification thereof.

         The Company shall reimburse the Lender for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses payable by the Lender to third parties incurred before or
after the date of this commitment letter in connection with the Loan or the
preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this commitment letter, the
Loan Documents and any other documentation contemplated hereby or thereby; the
enforcement of the Company's obligations hereunder; due diligence investigations
relating to the Portfolio Hotels, the Borrower, the Company and the Proposed
Plan, the approval of this commitment letter and/or the Loan by the Bankruptcy
Court


                                       3
<PAGE>

and/or any of the creditors or other committees participating in the Company's
bankruptcy proceeding, participation with the Company in defending any appeal of
the Confirmation Order, including, without limitation reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, appraisal costs, costs of environmental assessments, and
costs of any inspecting architects, engineers or other consultants retained by
the Lender. In addition, if the Closing occurs while any appeal of the
Confirmation Order is pending, the Company shall indemnify the Lender for
losses, costs and expenses resulting from such appeal. The Lender shall use its
best reasonable efforts to (a) provide the Company with an estimated expense
budget as soon as practicable after, and, in any event, within 14 days after,
the Company's timely acceptance of this commitment letter, (b) provide the
Company with notice of any material upward revisions to the expense budget as
soon as practicable after the Lender determines that the same are appropriate,
(c) provide the Company with a reasonably prompt notice and description of
actual expenses incurred by the Lender for the account of the Borrower when such
expenses reach $250,000, and each $100,000 increment in excess of $250,000 and
(d) advise the Company in advance of its intention to incur more than $50,000 in
out-of-pocket costs with respect to any due diligence item(s). The Lender's
failure to perform its obligations set forth in the preceding sentence shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to reimburse the Lender for its costs and
expenses. With respect to any opinions or other advice of local counsel required
in connection with the Loan, the Lender and the Borrower shall use the same
local counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Lender, for each jurisdiction in
which a Portfolio Hotel is located.

         The obligations of the Company set forth in the immediately preceding
paragraph shall continue and are and shall remain absolute obligations of the
Company, whether or not Loan Documents are executed or any loan is made by the
Lender or any conditions of lending are met, provided, however, that such
obligations shall terminate upon the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents. The obligations of the Lender under this commitment letter shall be
enforceable solely by the Company and may not be relied upon by any other
person.

         This commitment letter and the SPT are for the Company's/Borrower's
confidential use only and may not be disclosed by them to any person other than
their employees, attorneys, financial advisors, members of the Company's
official committee of unsecured creditors, such committee's financial advisors
and as required in connection with obtaining approval of this commitment letter
and the Final Plan by the Bankruptcy Court and then only in connection with the
proposed transaction and, other than in connection with Bankruptcy Court
approvals, on a confidential basis, except where disclosure is required by law
or where the Lender consents to the proposed disclosure, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

         Please indicate your acceptance of the commitment herein contained in
the space indicated below and return a copy of this commitment letter so
executed to Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital Inc. at 4 World Financial Center 7th
Floor, New York, New York, 10080; Attention Michael Nash. This commitment will
expire at 5:00 p.m. on July 12, 2002, unless on or prior to such time Merrill
Lynch shall have received a copy of this commitment letter executed by the
Company. Notwithstanding timely acceptance of this commitment letter pursuant to
the preceding sentence, the commitment herein contained will automatically
terminate and the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder (other
than the Company's obligations set forth in the seventh paragraph hereof) if (a)
the Company does not file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking the
Approval Order (hereinafter defined) on or prior to


                                       4
<PAGE>

July 19, 2002, (b) the Bankruptcy Court does not enter an order (the "APPROVAL

performance of the Company's obligations hereunder and the Approval Order has
not become non-appealable with no appeal pending on or prior to August 30, 2002,
(c) the Company does not pay either $500,000 installment of the Commitment Fee
(as defined in the SPT) as and when due in accordance with the SPT; (d) the

2002. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not earlier than September 1, 2002, the
Company may request in writing (an "EXTENSION REQUEST") that the Lender agree to
extend the deadlines set forth in clauses (d) and (e) each by not more than 60
days. If the Lender proposes to agree to such extensions, the Company shall pay
the Lender $350,000 (the "EXTENSION FEE")in consideration of, and as a condition
to, such agreement. If the Lender does not agree in writing to such extensions
on or prior to the 10th day following the Lender's receipt of an Extension
Request, the Company may, by written notice to the Lender given not later than
the 20th day following the Lender's receipt of such Extension Request, terminate
this commitment letter and the parties shall have no further obligations
hereunder except for the Company's obligations set forth in the seventh
paragraph hereof and its obligation to pay, if due in accordance with the SPT,
the balance of the Commitment Fee.

         The Lender reserves the right to assign some or all of its rights and
delegate some or all of its responsibilities hereunder to one of its affiliates.
This commitment letter and the SPT supersede any and all prior versions hereof
or thereof. This commitment letter may only be amended by a writing signed by
all parties hereto. This commitment letter may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which

                                    right to extend the Loan Term for additional
                                    Extension Periods shall be subject to

                                    for that month, provided, however, that if
                                    Excess Cash Flow in any month exceeds the
                                    amount necessary to make the required
                                    principal payment, such excess shall be
                                    applied to reduce principal to the extent of
                                    "shortfalls" from prior months. Commencing
                                    on the first anniversary of the Closing, the
                                    Borrower shall make monthly principal
                                    payments (in addition to interest) of
                                    $375,000. Commencing on the second
                                    anniversary of the Closing and through the
                                    Maturity Date (including any Extension
                                    Periods), the Borrower shall make monthly

                                    principal payments (in addition to interest)
                                    of $500,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                                    if any principal prepayment made in
                                    connection with a Permitted Release exceeds
                                    the Allocated Loan Amount of the released
                                    Portfolio Hotel, such excess may be
                                    "applied" by the Borrower to offset its
                                    obligations to make the foregoing scheduled
                                    principal payments. If the principal amount
                                    of the Loan is ever reduced to or below 30%
                                    of the original Loan Amount, all Excess Cash
                                    Flow shall be applied monthly as a principal
                                    prepayment, without imposition of a
                                    Prepayment Fee and without regard to the
                                    preceding sentence.

ASSUMABILITY:                       The Loan may be assumed in whole, but not in
                                    part, subject to reasonable approval by the
                                    Lender of the transferee (and, if the Loan
                                    has been securitized, letters from the
                                    applicable rating agencies that such
                                    assumption will not result in a downgrade,
                                    withdrawal or qualification of any rating
                                    assigned to the securities evidencing an
                                    interest in the Loan) and payment of any
                                    reasonable costs and expenses incurred by

                                    Confirmation Order. "CLOSING" means the
                                    execution and delivery of the Loan Agreement

                                    behalf of the Lender at a bank acceptable to
                                    the Lender. All rents, receivables and other
                                    revenue generated in connection with the

                                    into the Lockbox Account. The Lender will
                                    select a servicer, acceptable to the
                                    Borrower in its reasonable discretion, to
                                    administer, at the Borrower's expense, the
                                    Loan, including the Lockbox Account and all
                                    other accounts, escrows and reserves. In

                                    pending notice of Default, an Event of
                                    Default or the existence of a Cash Trap
                                    Period, the lock box arrangement will
                                    provide that funds therein be applied first,
                                    to taxes, insurance and similar items,
                                    second, to other property expenses and/or
                                    reserves established therefor as set forth

ASSIGNMENT, PARTICIPATION,          The Lender shall have the right, without
SALE AND SECURITIZATION:            consent of the Borrower, to assign,
                                    syndicate, sell, securitize or participate

                                    structure shall not result in an increase to
                                    the Borrower in its overall borrowing costs
                                    with respect to the Loan, but without regard
                                    to the Borrower's obligation to pay its

                                    shall cooperate in such assignment,
