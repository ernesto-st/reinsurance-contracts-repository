The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related  entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any  interest rate used in this Agreement  or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant  adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may  select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this  Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to  the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or  entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential  damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity),  for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information  source or service.

(b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of  ABR Loans or Term Benchmark Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith.  Each Lender  at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to  make such Loan (and in the case of an Affiliate, the provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 shall  apply to such Affiliate to the same extent as to such Lender); provided that any exercise of such option shall  not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Revolving  Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and  not less than $1,000,000.  At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall  be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $1,000,000; provided  that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance  of the Aggregate Commitment or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as  contemplated by Section 2.06(e).  Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the  same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of three (3) Term Benchmark  Borrowings outstanding.

(j) Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on  the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders  (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than  50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the  Borrower shall deposit in an account or accounts with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the  Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders (the &#8220;LC Collateral Account&#8221;), an amount in cash  equal to 105% of the amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest  thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,  and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,  upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or  7.01(i).  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and  performance of the Obligations.  In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or Section 2.06(c), if any  LC Exposure remains outstanding after the expiration date specified in Section 2.06(c), the Borrower shall  immediately deposit into the LC Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of the amount of  such LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  The Administrative Agent  shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.   Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the  option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower&#8217;s risk and expense, such deposits  shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.   Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC  Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related fees, costs and customary  processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement  obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been  accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure  representing greater than 50% of the  total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount  of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent  not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events  of Default have been cured or waived. (k) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding that a Letter  of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary,  or states that a Subsidiary is the &#8220;account party,&#8221; &#8220;applicant,&#8221; &#8220;customer,&#8221; &#8220;instructing party,&#8221; or the like  of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of the Issuing Bank (whether arising  by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the  Borrower (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of  Credit (including to reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued  solely for the account of the Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise  be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of  such Letter of Credit.

SECTION 2.07 Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be  made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof solely by wire transfer of immediately available funds  by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated  by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  Except in respect of the provisions of this Agreement  covering the reimbursement of Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent will make such Loans  available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account of the  Administrative Agent to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New  York City or Chicago and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that  Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in  Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to  the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent  such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made  such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance  upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender  has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the  applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on  demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such  amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent,  at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative  Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the  Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the  Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing. SECTION 2.08 Interest Elections.  (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type  specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall  have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may  elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a  Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The  Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in  which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising  such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.   (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the  Administrative Agent of such election (by irrevocable written notice via an Interest Election Request signed  by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower; provided that, if such Interest Election Request is submitted  through an Approved Borrower Portal, the foregoing signature requirement may be waived at the sole  discretion of the Administrative Agent) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under  Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be  made on the effective date of such election.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section  shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to (i)  elect an Interest Period for Term Benchmark Loans  that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not  available under such Borrowing.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event  of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required  Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding  Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing and  (ii) unless repaid, (A) each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the  end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (B) each RFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR  Borrowing on the last day of the calendar month. SECTION 2.09 Termination and Reduction of Commitments.  (a) Unless previously  terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or  accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by  such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to  time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the  amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto,  (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower  to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder  for the account of the Lenders and each Lender&#8217;s share thereof.

In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to  such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in the form  attached hereto as Exhibit H or as otherwise approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans  evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment  pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document,  at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then- current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such  Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to  time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor  for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information  announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the  Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; for any Benchmark settings at or after  such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed  pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a  Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement  that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then  the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; for all Benchmark settings at or  after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (f) Upon the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark  Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for (i) a Term Benchmark Borrowing or a   conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued or (ii) a RFR  Borrowing or conversion to RFR Loans, during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the  Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR  Borrowing, as applicable, into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to (A) solely with respect to any  such request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple  SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) an ABR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily  Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event.  During any Benchmark Unavailability  Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component  of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as  applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.  Furthermore, if any Term  Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice of the  commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such  Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented  pursuant to this Section 2.14, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period  applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR  Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event  or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event,  on such day and (2) any RFR Loan shall on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent  to, and shall constitute an ABR Loan. </FONT></DIV>

(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is  required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority  for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender,  then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative  Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the  restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments  pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to  an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts  such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the  Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not  unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the  outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued  fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding  principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the  case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments  required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such  compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,  prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower  to require such  assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment  required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed  by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement  incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform  as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (ii) the Lender required to make  such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed  to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any  such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents  </FONT></DIV>

Each of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now  conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in,  every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.  Schedule 3.01 hereto (as supplemented from time  to time) identifies each Subsidiary, the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may  be, the percentage of issued and outstanding shares of each class of its capital stock or other equity  interests owned by the Borrower and the other Subsidiaries and, if such percentage is not 100%  (excluding directors&#8217; qualifying shares as required by law), a description of each class issued and  outstanding.  All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each Subsidiary  are validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares and other equity  interests indicated on Schedule 3.01 as owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary are owned,  beneficially and of record, by the Borrower or any Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens.  Except as  identified on Schedule 3.01, there are no outstanding commitments or other obligations of the Borrower  or any Subsidiary to issue, and no options, warrants or other rights of any Person to acquire, any shares of  any class of capital stock or other equity interests of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

The Transactions (a) do not  require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental  Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate  any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or  result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any  of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of, or the  requirement to create, any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

The rights and remedies of the  Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents  are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver  of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any  event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver  or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">      Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  On November 23, 2021, Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) entered into Note Purchase Agreements (the &#8220;Purchase Agreements&#8221;) with  certain institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers (collectively, the &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;) pursuant to which the Company issued and  sold $100 million of 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). The Purchase Agreements contain certain customary representations,  warranties and covenants made by the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, severally and not jointly, on the other hand. The Company  intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including growth capital.  The Notes were offered and sold by the Company in a private placement transaction in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereunder.  On November 23, 2021, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company entered into Registration Rights Agreements (the  &#8220;Registration Rights Agreements&#8221;) with the Purchasers. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements, the Company has agreed to take certain  actions to provide for the exchange of the Notes for notes that are registered under the Securities Act and have substantially the same terms as the Notes  (the &#8220;Exchange Offer&#8221;). Under certain circumstances, if the Company fails to meet its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreements, it would be  required to pay additional interest to the holders of the Notes.  On November 23, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture, relating to the issuance of the Notes (the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), by and between the Company  and Issuer and UMB Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into or exchangeable,  other than pursuant to the Exchange Offer, for any other securities or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Notes are not subject to  redemption at the option of the holder. On or after November 30, 2023, the Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at redemption prices  (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) equal to (i) 102.81250% for the twelve-month period beginning on November 30, 2023; (ii)  101.40625% for the twelve-month period beginning on November 30, 2024 and (iii) 100.000% at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest  up to, but not including, the redemption date.  The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum, subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of a downgrade or subsequent upgrade of the  rating assigned to the Notes. Interest on the Notes will be payable by the Company on May 30 and November 30 of each year, beginning on May 30,  2022. The Notes mature on November 30, 2026.  The Indenture contains certain financial covenants, including:       &#8226;   the Company shall maintain cash on hand at least equal to the next twelve months of interest payments on the Notes so long as the Notes remain  outstanding;       &#8226;   the Company must maintain Total Consolidated Indebtedness to Total Consolidated GAAP Capitalization (as these terms are defined in the  Indenture) less than or equal to 40%, as of the end of each calendar quarter;        &#8226;   other than existing secured indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Company will not incur or permit to exist any mortgage,  pledge, encumbrance or lien or charge securing indebtedness on any property or asset of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in excess of 20%  of the Total Consolidated Indebtedness of the Company, when combined with any existing secured indebtedness of the Company or any of its  subsidiaries; and       &#8226;   the Company will use reasonable best efforts to maintain a rating of the Notes from Egan-Jones Ratings Company or any other &#8220;nationally  recognized statistical rating organization&#8221; as defined under the Securities Act.  The Indenture contains events of default, the occurrence of which may result in the acceleration of the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Notes in certain  circumstances. Upon an event of default and for as long as such event of default remains outstanding, the Company will not declare or pay any cash  dividends to its stockholders.     2  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

Section 1.04 Acts of Holders.  (1) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by or under this Indenture to be made,  given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in  person or by an agent duly appointed in writing. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action will become effective when such instrument  or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments  and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the &#8220;Act&#8221; of the Holders signing such  instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a  Note, will be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 5.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company and any agent  of the Trustee or the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.  (2) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any reasonable manner that the  Trustee deems sufficient and in accordance with such reasonable rules as the Trustee may determine, and the Trustee may, in any instance, require  further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.

Unless otherwise specified, if not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Holder made by any Person in  respect of any such action, any such record date will be the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list  of Holders furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, and only such Persons, will be  entitled to make, give or take such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, whether or not such Holders remain  Holders after such record date. No such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action will be valid or effective if  made, given or taken more than 90 days after such record date.  (5) Any effective request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act by the Holder of any Note will bind every  future Holder of the same Note and the Holder of every Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in  respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not  notation of such Act is made upon such Note.  (6) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Note may do so with regard  to all or any part of the principal amount of such Note or by one or more duly appointed agents, each of which may do so in accordance with such  appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount. Any notice given or action taken by a Holder or its agents with regard to different  parts of such principal amount in accordance with this paragraph will have the same effect as if given or taken by separate Holders of each such different  part.

The Company may fix a record  date for the purpose of determining the Persons who are beneficial owners of interests in any Global Note entitled under the Applicable Procedures of  such Depositary to make, give or take, by a proxy or proxies duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,  waiver or other action provided in this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders. If such a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or  their duly appointed proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, will be entitled to make, give or take such request, demand, authorization, direction,  notice, consent, waiver or other action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. No such request, demand, authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action will be valid or effective if made, given or taken more than 90 days after such record date. Promptly  upon any record date being set in accordance with this Section 1.04, the Company, at its own expense, will cause notice of the record date, the proposed  action by Holders and the expiration date to be given to the Trustee in writing and the Holders in the manner set forth in Section 1.05.     6  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

Any report in accordance with Section 313 of the Trust Indenture Act will be transmitted in compliance with subsection (c) therein. If the  Company delivers a notice or communication to Holders, the Company will deliver a copy to the Trustee at the same time.

Any notice that is delivered  in the manner herein provided will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given or provided. In the case by reason of the suspension of regular  mail service or by reason of any other cause it will be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as will be made with the approval  of the Trustee will constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.  Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either  before or after the event, and such waiver will be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Notes will be filed with the Trustee, but  such filing will not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to any Holder of a Global Note, or of an interest therein,  such notice will be sufficiently given if given to the Depositary for such Global Note (or its designee) according to the Applicable Procedures of such  Depositary prescribed for giving such notice.  Section 1.06 Language of Notices.  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act required or permitted under this Indenture will be in the  English language, except that, if the Company so elects, any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.  Section 1.07 Incorporation by Reference of Trust Indenture Act; Conflicts.  Whenever this Indenture refers to a provision of the Trust Indenture Act, the provision is incorporated by reference in and made a part of this  Indenture. The Trust Indenture Act term &#8220;obligor&#8221; used in this Indenture means the Company and any successor obligor upon the Notes.  All other terms used in this Indenture that are defined by the Trust Indenture Act, reference to another statute or Commission rule under the Trust  Indenture Act have the meanings so assigned to them as of the date of this Indenture. If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits,  qualifies or conflicts with another provision included in this Indenture that is required to be included in this Indenture by any of Sections 310 to 317,  inclusive of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision will control. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties  imposed by Section 318(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, the duties imposed by Section 318(c) of the Trust Indenture Act will control. If any provision of  this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the provisions of the Trust Indenture  Act will be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or will be excluded, as the case may be.     7  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">    Article II  THE NOTES  Section 2.01 Forms Generally.  The Notes, the Trustee&#8217;s certificate of authentication and the Global Notes will be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-l and Exhibit A-2, as  applicable, which are a part of this Indenture. The Notes may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage  (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). The Company will provide any such notations,  legends or endorsements to the Trustee in writing. Each Note will be dated the date of its authentication. The terms and provisions contained in the  Notes will constitute, and are hereby expressly made a part of this Indenture and the Company and the Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this  Indenture, agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound thereby. However, to the extent any provision of any Note irreconcilably conflicts with  the express provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Indenture will govern and be controlling.  Section 2.02 Definitive Notes.  The Initial Notes and the Exchange Notes will be issued initially in the form of one or more Definitive Notes, unless, before the issuance of such  Initial Notes or Exchange Notes, the Company has determined that the Notes may be represented by Global Notes and has so notified the Trustee, in  which event the Initial Notes and/or Exchange Notes will be issued in the form of one or more Global Notes. Except as provided in Section 2.07,  Holders of Definitive Notes will not be entitled to transfer Definitive Notes in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Notes, and owners of  beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Definitive Notes.  Section 2.03 Global Notes.  Each Global Note issued under this Indenture will be deposited with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, as custodian for the Depositary, and  registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee thereof, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter  provided. The aggregate principal amount of any Global Note may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of  the Trustee and the Depositary as hereinafter provided. Any adjustment of the aggregate principal amount of a Global Note to reflect the amount of any  increase or decrease in the amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby will be made by the Trustee in accordance with instructions given by the  Holder thereof as required by Section 2.07 hereof and will be made on the records of the Trustee and the Depositary.  Section 2.04 Restricted Notes.  Each Restricted Definitive Note and Restricted Global Note will bear a legend in substantially the following form:  THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF  1933, AS AMENDED (THE &#8220;SECURITIES ACT&#8221;) OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW. THESE SECURITIES  MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION  FROM, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) IN ACCORDANCE AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT  AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR BLUE SKY LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL  OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, IF REQUESTED, OR (II) UNLESS SOLD IN  ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 144 UNDER SAID ACT.  The Private Placement Legend set forth above will be removed and a new Note of like tenor and principal amount without such Private Placement  Legend will be executed by the Company, and upon written request of the Company (together with an Officers&#8217; Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel),  the Trustee will authenticate and deliver such new Note to the respective Holder, if legal counsel to the Holder or owner of beneficial interests  requesting the removal of such Private Placement Legend delivers to the Trustee, any Registrar and Paying Agent (if a different Person than the Trustee)  and the Company an opinion of counsel in compliance with this Indenture and additionally opining that the Note is eligible for immediate resale,  without any remaining holding period, under Rule 144 without regard to the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public  information required under Rule 144 as to such securities.  Section 2.05 Execution and Authentication.  Notes will be executed on behalf of the Company by any Authorized Officer and may (but need not) have the Company&#8217;s corporate seal or a  facsimile thereof reproduced thereon. The signature of an Authorized Officer on the Notes may be manual or facsimile. Notes bearing the manual or  facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time of execution, Authorized Officers of the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such  Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Notes.     10  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">    The Trustee or an Authenticating Agent will authenticate and deliver the Initial Notes for original issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to  $100,000,000 upon one or more Company Orders and an Opinion of Counsel. In addition, the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent will, upon receipt of a  Company Order, Opinion of Counsel and Officers&#8217; Certificate, authenticate and deliver any Exchange Notes for an aggregate principal amount not to  exceed $100,000,000 specified in such Company Order for Exchange Notes issued hereunder. The aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes at  any time may not exceed the amount set forth in the foregoing sentence, except as otherwise provided in this Article II. The Notes will be issued only in  registered form without coupons and in minimum denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  The Trustee will not be required to authenticate any Notes if the issue of such Notes under this Indenture will affect the Trustee&#8217;s own rights,  duties or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture, or otherwise affect the trustee in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or if  the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken.  No Note will be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Note a  certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by or on behalf of the Trustee or by the Authenticating Agent by the  manual signature of one of its authorized signatories. Such certificate upon any Note will be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note  has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  Section 2.06 Registrar and Paying Agent.  The Company will maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (&#8220;Registrar&#8221;) and an  office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment (&#8220;Paying Agent&#8221;). The Registrar will keep a register of the Notes (&#8220;Note Register&#8221;) and of  their transfer and exchange. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes. The Company may appoint one or  more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term &#8220;Registrar&#8221; includes any co-registrar, and the term &#8220;Paying Agent&#8221; includes any  additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to any Holder; provided that no such removal or  replacement will be effective until a successor Paying Agent or Registrar will have been appointed by the Company and will have accepted such  appointment. The Company will notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture. If  the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee will act as such. The Company or any of its  Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.  The Company initially appoints the Trustee to act as the Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes and, in the event that any Notes are issued in  global form, to initially act as custodian with respect to the Global Notes. In the event that the Trustee will not be or will cease to be Registrar with  respect the Notes, it will have the right to examine the Note Register at all reasonable times. There will be only one Note Register.  Section 2.07 Registration of Transfer and Exchange  (1) Except as otherwise provided in or under this Indenture, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note, the Company will  execute, and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes denominated as  authorized in or under this Indenture of a like aggregate principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical  terms and provisions.  Except as otherwise provided in or under this Indenture, at the option of the Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes containing identical  terms and provisions, in any authorized denominations (minimum denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) and  of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency for such purpose. Whenever any Notes are so  surrendered for exchange, the Company will execute, and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver, subject to the terms hereof, the Notes that the Holder  making the exchange is entitled to receive.  All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes will be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt and  entitling the Holders thereof to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.  Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption will (if so required by the Company or the  Registrar for such Note) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in a form satisfactory to the Company and the  Registrar for such Note duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.     11  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

Except as otherwise provided in or under this Indenture, the Company will not be required to (i) issue, register the transfer of or exchange any  Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the selection for redemption of Notes under Section 10.03 and  ending at the close of business on the day of such selection, or (ii) register the transfer of or exchange any Note, or portion thereof, so selected for  redemption, except in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed.  Any Registrar appointed in accordance with Section 2.06 hereof will provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may reasonably  require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Notes upon transfer or exchange of Notes. No Registrar will be required to make  registrations of transfer or exchange of Notes during any periods designated in the Notes or in this Indenture as periods during which such registration of  transfers and exchanges need not be made.  The Trustee will have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this  Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among Depositary  participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence  as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine  substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.  Neither the Trustee nor any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.  (2) When Definitive Notes are presented by a Holder to the Registrar with a request to register the transfer of such Definitive Notes or to  exchange such Definitive Notes for an equal principal amount of Definitive Notes of other authorized denominations, the Registrar will register the  transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Definitive Notes  surrendered for transfer or exchange will be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the  Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder&#8217;s attorney duly authorized in writing.  (3) A Global Note may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to the  Depositary or to another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor  Depositary. All Global Notes will be exchanged by the Company for Definitive Notes if: (i) the Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling  or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Note or such Depositary has ceased to be a &#8220;clearing agency&#8221; registered under the Exchange Act,  and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (ii) the Company determines that the Notes are no longer to be represented  by Global Notes and so notifies the Trustee or (iii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes and the Depositary or its  participant(s) has requested the issuance of Definitive Notes. Any Global Note exchanged in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) above will be so  exchanged in whole and not in part, and any Global Note exchanged in accordance with clause (iii) above may be exchanged in whole or from time to  time in part as directed by the Depositary. Upon the occurrence of any of the events in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, Definitive Notes will be issued in fully  registered form, without interest coupons, will have an aggregate Principal Amount equal to that of the Global Note or portion thereof to be so  exchanged, will be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary will instruct the Trustee in writing and will bear  such legends as provided herein. Global Notes also may be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Section 2.09 hereof. Every Note  authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu of, a Global Note or any portion thereof, in accordance with this Section 2.07 or Section 2.09  hereof, will be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and will be, a Global Note, except as otherwise provided herein. A Global Note may not be  exchanged for another Note other than as provided in this Section 2.07(3); however, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be transferred and  exchanged as provided in Section 2.07(4) hereof.  Any Global Note to be exchanged in whole will be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee. With regard to any Global Note to be exchanged  in part, either such Global Note will be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with  respect to such Global Note, the principal amount thereof will be reduced by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged by means of an  appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Note  issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof.

After the Company has determined that the Notes may be represented by Global Notes and  so notifies the Trustee, then upon receipt by the Trustee of a Definitive Note duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer in  form satisfactory to the Trustee, together with written instructions from such Holder directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Registrar to make, an  adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Note to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented  by the Global Note, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such increase, the Trustee will cancel  such Definitive Note and cause, or direct the Registrar to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the  Depositary and the Registrar, the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by the Global Note to be increased by the aggregate principal amount  of the Definitive Note to be exchanged, and will credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial  interest in the Global Note equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Note so cancelled. If no Global Notes are then outstanding, the Company will  issue and the Trustee will authenticate, upon Company Order, a new Global Note in the appropriate principal amount.  (6) At such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been exchanged for Definitive Notes or a particular Global  Note has been repurchased or canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note will be returned to or retained and canceled by the Trustee in  accordance with Section 2.12 hereof. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for or transferred to  a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for Definitive Notes, the principal amount of Notes  represented by such Global Note will be reduced accordingly by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if the  beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global  Note, such other Global Note will be increased accordingly by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee to reflect such increase.  (7) No Restricted Note will be transferred or exchanged except in compliance with the Private Placement Legend or as provided in  accordance with Section 2.08. In addition to the provisions for transfer and exchange set forth in this Section 2.07, the Trustee, any Registrar and Paying  Agent (if a different Person than the Trustee) and the Company may, prior to effecting any requested transfer or exchange of any Restricted Notes, other  than an exchange in accordance with Section 2.08, require that legal counsel to the Holder or owner of beneficial interests requesting such transfer or  exchange deliver to the Trustee, any Registrar and Paying Agent (if a different Person than the Trustee) and the Company an Opinion of Counsel in  compliance with this Indenture and additionally opining that the transfer or exchange is in compliance with the requirements of the Private Placement  Legend and that the Note issued to the transferee or in exchange for the Restricted Note may be issued free of the Private Placement Legend. Any  un-transferred or un-exchanged balance of a Restricted Note will be reissued to the Holder with the Private Placement Legend unless the Private  Placement Legend may be omitted in accordance with Section 2.04, as evidenced by the Opinion of Counsel.  Section 2.08 Exchange Offer.  Upon the occurrence of an Exchange Offer in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will issue, and upon receipt of a  Company Order in accordance with Section 2.05 hereof, the Trustee will authenticate, (i) Unrestricted Definitive Notes in an aggregate principal amount  equal to the principal amount of the Restricted Definitive Notes tendered in such Exchange Offer for acceptance by Persons that certify in the applicable  Letters of Transmittal that (x) they are not Participating Broker-Dealers, (y) they are not participating in a distribution of the applicable Exchange Notes  and (z) they are not Affiliates of the Company, and accepted for exchange in such Exchange Offer or, if permitted by the Company, (ii) one or more  Unrestricted Global Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Notes  tendered in such Exchange Offer for acceptance by Persons that certify in the applicable Letters of Transmittal that (x) they are not Participating  Broker-Dealers, (y) they are not participating in a distribution of the applicable Exchange Notes and (z) they are not Affiliates of the Company, and  accepted for exchange in such Exchange Offer. Concurrently with the issuance of such Unrestricted Global Notes upon exchange of Restricted Global  Notes, the Trustee will cause the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Restricted Global Notes to be reduced accordingly, and the Company will  execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver to the Persons designated the Holders of Restricted Definitive Notes so accepted Unrestricted  Definitive Notes in the applicable principal amount. Any Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of such Exchange Offer, and Exchange  Notes issued in connection with such Exchange Offer, will be treated as a single class of securities under this Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the  only remedy for breach of registration rights by the Company is the Additional Interest set forth in Section 2(e) of the Registration Rights Agreement.

If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 2.09, the Company will execute and the Trustee will  authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Note containing identical terms, of like principal amount and bearing a number not  contemporaneously outstanding.     13  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">    If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note and (ii) such  security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the  Company or the Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company will execute, and upon the Company&#8217;s request, the  Trustee will authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new Note containing identical terms, of like  principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.09, in case the outstanding principal balance of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen  Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed by the Company pursuant to Article X hereof, the Company in its  discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay or redeem such Note, as the case may be.  Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected  therewith.  Every new Note issued in accordance with this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Note will constitute a separate obligation of the  Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note will be at any time enforceable by anyone, and will be entitled to all the benefits of this  Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.  The provisions of this Section, as amended or supplemented in accordance with this Indenture with respect to particular Notes or generally, will  (to the extent lawful) be exclusive and will (to the extent lawful) preclude all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of  mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.  Section 2.10 Payment of Interest; Rights to Interest Preserved.  Any interest on any Note that will be payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in  whose name such Note is registered as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date.  Any interest on any Note that will be payable, but will not be punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for such Note  (herein called &#8220;Defaulted Interest&#8221;) will cease to be payable to the Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such  Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in either clause (1) or (2) below:  (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Person in whose name such Note will be registered at the  close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which will be fixed in the following manner. The Company will  notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on such Note and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same  time the Company will deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted  Interest or will make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so  deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Person entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon, the Company will fix  or cause to be fixed a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which will be no less than 15 days from the proposed payment.  The Company (or, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) will cause notice of the  proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be delivered to the Holder of such Note at the Holder&#8217;s address as  it appears in the Note Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Company may, at its discretion, in the name and at the  expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper of general circulation in the City of New  York, New York, but such publication will not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed  payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been delivered as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest will be paid to the  Person in whose name such Note will be registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date.  (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any  securities exchange on which such Note may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the  Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment under this Clause, such payment will be deemed practicable by the Trustee.  Unless otherwise provided in or under this Indenture or the Notes, at the option of the Company, interest on Notes that bear interest may be paid  by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address will appear in the Note Register or by transfer to an account maintained  by the payee with a bank located in the United States.     14  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

Section 2.11 Persons Deemed Owners.  Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat  the Person in whose name such Note is registered in the Note Register as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of  and (subject to Section 2.07 and Section 2.10) interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to  such Note will be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee will be affected by notice to the contrary.  No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Note held on its behalf by a Depositary will have any rights under this Indenture with respect to  such Global Note, and such Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such  Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability  for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising  or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will prevent the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Registrar from giving effect to any  written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the applicable Depositary, as a Holder, with respect to a Global Note or impair, as  between such Depositary and the owners of beneficial interests in such Global Note, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the  rights of such Depositary (or its nominee) as the Holder of such Global Note.  Section 2.12 Cancellation.  All Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange will, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be  delivered to the Trustee, and any such Note, as well as Notes surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose, will be cancelled promptly by the  Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the  Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered will be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. No Notes will be  authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by or under this Indenture. All  cancelled Notes held by the Trustee will be disposed of in accordance with its procedure for the disposition of cancelled Notes, and the Trustee, upon  the written request of the Company, will deliver to the Company a certificate of such disposition, unless by a Company Order the Company shall direct  that cancelled Notes shall be returned to the Company.  Section 2.13 Computation of Interest.  Interest will be computed from and including the original issue date of the Notes to but excluding November 30, 2026, or the earlier redemption  date contemplated by Article X of this Indenture, at the rate of 5.625% per annum (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.14 hereof),  computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of 12 30-day months and payable semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date. Dollar  amounts resulting from this calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded up.  In the event that any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined for purposes of this Section 2.13 and the Notes  below), the interest payment due on that date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue as a result  of that postponement. The term &#8220;Business Day&#8221; as used in this Section 2.13 and in the Notes means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or any other  day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are generally authorized or required by law or executive order to be closed.  Section 2.14 Interest Rate Adjustment.  From and after the original issue date of the Notes, in the event the Notes are downgraded by the Ratings Agency below A- but equal to or above  BBB-, the rate of interest on the Notes shall increase by 0.50% to 6.125%. If the rating is subsequently increased back to A- or higher, the rate of  interest will decrease by 0.50% to 5.625%. If the rating is further downgraded to BB+ or lower, the rate of interest will increase by another 0.50% to  6.625%. If the rating is subsequently improved back to BBB- or higher, the rate of interest will decrease by 0.50% to 6.125%. Each adjustment required  by any event described in this Section 2.14 will take effect from the first Interest Payment Date following the date on which the Company receives  notice that such event has occurred. As such, interest will not accrue at such increased or decreased rate until the next Interest Payment Date following  the date on which the event occurs. If the Ratings Agency changes its rating of the Notes more than once prior to any particular Interest Payment Date or  ceases to provide a rating of the Notes, the last change by Ratings Agency prior to such Interest Payment Date     15  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

For the avoidance of doubt, no interest rate increase or decrease described in  this Section 2.14 will have any effect on interest that will have accrued on the Notes prior to such date or have any other retroactive effect.  Section 2.15 CUSIP Numbers.  The Company may issue the Notes with one or more &#8220;CUSIP&#8221; numbers (if then generally in use). The Company will promptly notify the Trustee  of any change in the &#8220;CUSIP&#8221; numbers. The Trustee may use &#8220;CUSIP&#8221; numbers in notices (including, but not limited to, notices of redemption or  exchange) as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers  either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice (including any notice of redemption or exchange) and that reliance may be placed only on the  other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such notice will not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Notes, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under  Section 5.07 and, if money will have been deposited with the Trustee in accordance with Section 3.01(1)(b), the obligations of the Company and the  Trustee with respect to the Notes under Section 3.03 and Section 9.03, will survive.  Section 3.02 Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.  (1) The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have Section 3.02(2) or Section 3.02(3) be applied to such Outstanding Notes  upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Section 3.02. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance may be effected only with respect  to all, and not less than all, of the Outstanding Notes.

For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness  represented by such Outstanding Notes, which will thereafter be deemed to be &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; only for the purposes of Section 3.02(5) and the other  Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Notes and  this Indenture insofar as such Notes are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, will execute proper instruments     16  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that with respect to such Outstanding  Notes, the Company may omit to comply with, and will have no liability in respect of, any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or  any such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by  reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document, and such omission to comply will  not constitute a default, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes will be unaffected thereby.  (4) The following will be the conditions to application of Section 3.02(2) or Section 3.02(3) to any Outstanding Notes:  (a) The Company will irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the  requirements of Section 5.08 who will agree to comply with the provisions of this Section 3.02 applicable to it) trust funds in trust for the purpose of  making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders: (i) an amount in Dollars,  (ii) Government Obligations that through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide,  not later than one day before the due date of any payment of principal of and interest, if any, on such Notes, money or (iii) a combination thereof, in any  case, in an amount sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of such principal and interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of  independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which will be applied by  the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and interest, if any, on such Outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity of  such principal or installment of principal or interest or the applicable Redemption Date, as the case may be.

If the Company fails to pay the money it is required to pay the Trustee, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may  institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may  enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner  provided by law out of the property of the Company, wherever situated.  The Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Notes by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the  Trustee will deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this  Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other proper remedy.  Upon an Event of Default, the Company may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a  liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company&#8217;s capital stock, other than: (i) any dividends or distributions in shares of, or options, warrants  or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, any class of Company&#8217;s common stock; (ii) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the  implementation of a shareholders&#8217; rights plan, the issuance of stock under any such plan in the future or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights  pursuant thereto; (iii) as a result of a reclassification of Company&#8217;s capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of Company&#8217;s  capital stock for another class or series of Company&#8217;s capital stock; (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Company&#8217;s capital stock in  accordance with the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged; or (v) purchases of any class  of Company&#8217;s common stock related to the issuance of common stock or rights under any benefit plans for Company&#8217;s directors, officers or employees  or any of Company&#8217;s dividend reinvestment plans.     19  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

Section 4.07 Unconditional Right of Holders to Payments.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Note will have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive  payment of the principal of and (subject to Section 2.07 and Section 2.10) any interest on such Note on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities  expressed in such Note (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date), and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and such  rights will not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy under this  Indenture or otherwise will not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.  Section 4.10 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.  No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Notes to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default will impair  any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in any such Event of Default.

Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising from such default will be deemed to have been cured for  every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any consequent right.  Section 4.13 Undertaking for Costs.  All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Notes by his acceptance of such Notes will be deemed to have agreed, that any court  may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action  taken, suffered, or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court  may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard  to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 4.13 will not apply to any suit  instituted by the Trustee, any Holder or any group of Holders holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, or  to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on any Notes on or after the Stated Maturity  or Maturities expressed in such Notes (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

(3) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision hereof that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs  (1) and (2) of this Section 5.01 and Section 5.02.  (4) No provision hereof will require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee will be under no  obligation to exercise any of its rights and powers under this Indenture at the request of any Holders, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee  security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.  (5) The Trustee will not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company.  Money held in trust by the Trustee shall be held un-invested and need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.     22  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

(4) No Person will accept its appointment hereunder as a successor Trustee unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Person  will be qualified and eligible under this Article. No resigning or removed Trustee shall have any liability or responsibility for the action or inaction of  any successor Trustee.  Section 5.11 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.  Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any  merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee will be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust  business of the Trustee, will be the successor of the Trustee hereunder (provided that such corporation will otherwise be qualified and eligible under this  Article), without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Notes will have been  authenticated but not delivered by the Trustee then in office, any such successor to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and  deliver the Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes. In case any Notes will not have  been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Notes in either its own name or that of its  predecessor Trustee.  Section 5.12 Appointment of Authenticating Agent.  The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents acceptable to the Company with respect to the Notes which will be authorized to act  on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Notes issued upon original issue, exchange, registration of transfer, partial redemption, partial repayment or in  accordance with Section 2.09, and Notes so authenticated will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and will be valid and obligatory for all  purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Notes by the  Trustee or the Trustee&#8217;s certificate of authentication, such reference will be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an  Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.

If at any  time an Authenticating Agent will cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it will resign immediately in the manner and  with the effect specified in this Section.  Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation  resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent will be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or  substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, will be the successor of such Authenticating Agent  hereunder, provided such corporation will be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the  part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.  An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and the Company. The Trustee may at any time  terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and the Company. Upon receiving such a  notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in the case that at any time such Authenticating Agent will cease to be eligible in accordance with  the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent that will be acceptable to the Company and will deliver written  notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names  and addresses appear in the Note Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, will become vested with  all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor  Authenticating Agent will be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 5.12.  The Company agrees to pay each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. If the  Trustee makes such payments, it will be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 5.07.  The provisions of Section 2.11, Section 5.04 and Section 5.05 will be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.     27  Schedule 6.01 </FONT></DIV>

If any Note called for redemption will not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal, until paid, will bear interest from the  Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Note or, if no rate is prescribed therefor in the Note, at the rate of interest, if any, borne by such  Note.  Section 10.07 Notes Redeemed in Part.

Indenture; Holders. This note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  &#8220;Company&#8221;), designated as the &#8220;5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026&#8221; (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 and  initially issued on November 23, 2021. The Company has issued this Note under that certain Indenture dated as of November 23, 2021, as the same may  be amended or supplemented from time to time (&#8220;Indenture&#8221;), between the Company and UMB Bank National Association, as Trustee. All capitalized  terms not otherwise defined in this Note will have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The terms of this Note include those stated in the  Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. This Note is subject to all such terms, and the Holder is referred  to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note irreconcilably conflicts with the  express provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture will govern and be controlling.  2. Payment.  (a) The Company, for value received, promises to pay to [&#8226;], or its registered assigns, the principal sum of [&#8226;] Dollars (U.S.) ($[&#8226;]), plus  accrued but unpaid interest on November 30, 2026 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;). The Company will pay interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum (subject to  adjustment as described below), computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and payable semi-annually on May 30 and  November 30 of each year (each payment date, an &#8220;Interest Payment Date&#8221;). Beginning November 30, 2021, in the event the Notes are downgraded by  the Ratings Agency below A- but equal to or above BBB-, the rate of interest on the Notes shall increase by 0.50% to 6.125%. If the rating is  subsequently increased back to A- or higher, the rate of interest will decrease by 0.50% to 5.625%. If the rating is further downgraded to BB+ or lower,  the rate of interest will increase by another 0.50% to 6.625%. If the rating is subsequently improved back to BBB- or higher, the rate of interest will  decrease by 0.50% to 6.125%. Each adjustment required by any event described herein will take effect from the first Interest Payment Date following  the date on which the Company receives notice that such event has occurred. As such, interest will not accrue at such increased or decreased rate until  the next Interest Payment Date following the date on which the event occurs. If the Ratings Agency changes its rating of the Notes more than once prior  to any particular Interest Payment Date or ceases to provide a rating of the Notes, the last change by the Ratings Agency prior to such Interest Payment  Date will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease.  (b) In the event that any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), the interest payment due on  that date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue as a result of that postponement. The term  &#8220;Business Day&#8221; means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are generally  authorized or required by law or executive order to be closed.

Indenture; Holders. This note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  &#8220;Company&#8221;) designated as the &#8220;5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026&#8221; (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 and  initially issued on November 23, 2021. The Company has issued this Note under that certain Indenture dated as of November 23, 2021, as the same may  be amended or supplemented from time to time (&#8220;Indenture&#8221;), between the Company and UMB Bank National Association, as Trustee.

This Note is subject to all such terms, and the Holder is referred  to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note irreconcilably conflicts with the  express provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture will govern and be controlling.  2. Payment.  (a) The Company, for value received, promises to pay to CEDE &amp; CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of ONE HUNDRED  MILLION Dollars (U.S.) ($100,000,000), plus accrued but unpaid interest on November 30, 2026 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;).

If the rating is subsequently increased back to A- or higher, the rate of interest will decrease by 0.50% to 5.625%. If the rating is  further downgraded to BB+ or lower, the rate of interest will increase by another 0.50% to 6.625%. If the rating is subsequently improved back to BBB-  or higher, the rate of interest will decrease by 0.50% to 6.125%.

As such, interest will not accrue at such  increased or decreased rate until the next Interest Payment Date following the date on which the event occurs. If the Ratings Agency changes its rating  of the Notes more than once prior to any particular Interest Payment Date or ceases to provide a rating of the Notes, the last change by the Ratings  Agency prior to such Interest Payment Date will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease.  (b) In the event that any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), the interest payment due on  that date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue as a result of that postponement. The term  &#8220;Business Day&#8221; means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are generally  authorized or required by law or executive order to be closed.

The relative fault of such indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand shall be  determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to  state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or parties or such indemnified party or parties, and the parties&#8217; relative  intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  (e) The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by  pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The  aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be  deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any  litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any  such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, other than in the case of intentional misrepresentation or omission of a material fact, no Holder  or Participating Broker-Dealer shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which Registrable  Securities sold by it exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer has otherwise been required to pay by reason  of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this private placement for general corporate purposes, including growth capital as primary rate  increases continue to earn through the Company&#8217;s book of business.  &#8220;We are very pleased to have completed this private placement to further our growth and to optimize our cost of capital, with strong demand from the  top-tier investor community. We look forward to demonstrating continued execution on our multi-year strategic priorities, including disciplined growth  in opportune markets and continued innovation in our services businesses, including our direct-to-consumer digital agency Clovered.com,&#8221; said Stephen  J. Donaghy, Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;I would also like to thank the Universal team for their process management, Piper Sandler &amp; Co. for their  execution, and Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and Mayer Brown LLP for their guidance.&#8221;  Piper Sandler &amp; Co. served as sole placement agent for the private placement. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP served as legal counsel to the Company,  and Mayer Brown LLP served as counsel to the placement agent in connection with the private placement.  The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent  registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company entered into  a registration rights agreement with each of the purchasers of the Notes pursuant to which the Company has agreed to take certain actions to provide for  the exchange of the Notes for notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), with substantially the same  terms as the Notes. This press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any  of the senior notes or any other securities, nor will there be any offer, solicitation or sale of the senior notes or any other securities, in any state or  jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or  jurisdiction. The Company has offered and sold the Notes only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and  institutional accredited investors (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act) in reliance upon the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities  Act and the provisions of Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
