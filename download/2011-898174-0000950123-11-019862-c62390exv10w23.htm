<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) dated as of February &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, 2011, is made by
and between Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated, a Missouri corporation (&#147;RGA&#148;) and <U>
(</U>&#148;Indemnitee&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>RECITALS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Indemnitee is a director of RGA and in such capacity is performing a valuable service for
RGA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;The Second Restated Articles of Incorporation of RGA requires RGA to indemnify its
directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by law, and indemnification is also
authorized by Section&nbsp;351.355 of The General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the
&#147;Indemnification Statute&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;The Second Restated Articles of Incorporation of RGA and the Indemnification Statute, under
which RGA is organized, expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are
not exclusive, and contemplate that contracts may be entered into between RGA and its directors and
officers with respect to indemnification.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;In accordance with the authorization provided by the Second Restated Articles of
Incorporation of RGA and the Indemnification Statute, directors and officers liability insurance
(&#147;D&#038;O Insurance&#148;) has been purchased covering certain liabilities which may be incurred by RGA&#146;s
directors and officers in the performance of their services for RGA, subsidiaries of RGA, and other
enterprises.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;RGA recognizes that competent and experienced persons are reluctant to serve as directors
or officers of corporations unless they are protected by comprehensive liability insurance or
indemnification, or both, due to increased exposure to litigation costs and risks resulting from
their service to such corporations, and due to the fact that the exposure frequently bears no
reasonable relationship to the compensation of such directors and officers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.&nbsp;The statutes and judicial decisions regarding the duties of directors and officers are
often difficult to apply, ambiguous, or conflicting, and therefore fail to provide such directors
and officers with adequate, reliable knowledge of legal risks to which they are exposed or
information regarding the proper course of action take.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G.&nbsp;RGA and Indemnitee recognize that plaintiffs often seek damages in such large amounts and
the costs of litigation may be so enormous (whether or not the case is meritorious), that the
defense and/or settlement of such litigation is often beyond the personal resources of directors
and officers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H.&nbsp;RGA believes that it is unfair for its directors and officers to assume the risk of huge
judgments and other expenses which may occur in cases in which the director or officer received no
personal profit and in cases where the director or officer was not culpable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.&nbsp;RGA, after reasonable investigation, has determined that policies of D&#038;O Insurance may be
inadequate in certain circumstances to cover all possible exposure from which Indemnitee should be
protected. RGA believes that the interests of RGA and its stockholders would best be served by a
combination of such insurance and the indemnification by RGA of the directors and officers of RGA.
To provide such protection and thereby induce Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve as a
director and/or officer of RGA, RGA has determined and agreed to enter into this Agreement with
Indemnitee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J.&nbsp;The Board of Directors has determined that contractual indemnification as set forth herein
is not only reasonable and prudent but necessary to promote the best interests of RGA and its
shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K.&nbsp;RGA desires and has requested Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve as a director and/or
officer of RGA free from undue concern for claims for damages arising out of or related to such
services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Indemnitee is willing to serve, or continue to serve, or to provide additional service as a
director and/or officer of RGA or for or on behalf of RGA, only on the condition that Indemnitee is
furnished the indemnity provided for herein.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any limitation on indemnity pursuant to Section&nbsp;2, RGA shall indemnify
Indemnitee and hold Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any
proceeding to which Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a party, or is threatened to be made
a party by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was at any time a director, officer, employee
or agent of RGA, or is or was serving or at any time serves at the request of RGA as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. To the extent that Indemnitee has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding, or in defense of any claim,
issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys&#146;
fees, actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the proceeding in question.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by RGA for
some or a portion of any expenses or liabilities of any type whatsoever (including, but not limited
to, attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement), but is not entitled,
however, to indemnification for the total amount thereof, RGA shall nevertheless indemnify the
Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which the Indemnitee is so entitled.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RGA may, but is not obligated to, obtain D&#038;O Insurance as may be or become available in
reasonable amounts from established and reputable insurers with respect to which Indemnitee is
named as an insured. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Company shall not
be obligated to indemnify Indemnitee for expenses or liabilities of any type which have been paid
directly to or on behalf of Indemnitee by D&#038;O Insurance. If RGA has D&#038;O Insurance in effect at the
time RGA receives from Indemnitee any notice of the commencement of a proceeding, RGA shall give
prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurer(s) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the applicable policy or policies. RGA shall thereafter take all necessary
or desirable action to cause such insurer(s) to pay, to or on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts
payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policy or policies.

Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state or local
law;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;from or on account of Indemnitee&#146;s conduct which is finally adjudged by a court having

actually prejudiced as a result thereof. With respect to any such proceeding as to which

the expense of Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by
RGA, (ii)&nbsp;RGA shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between RGA
and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such proceeding, or (iii)&nbsp;RGA shall not in fact
have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding, in each of which cases the
reasonable fees and expenses of Indemnitee&#146;s counsel shall be at the expense of RGA.

RGA, or is or was serving at the request or on behalf of RGA or a subsidiary of RGA as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or another enterprise, provided RGA receives an undertaking
from the Indemnitee agreeing to repay such amounts advanced in the event it is ultimately
determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by RGA therefor. The advances to
be made hereunder shall be paid by RGA to or on behalf of the Indemnitee promptly and in any event
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following delivery of a written request therefor by Indemnitee to RGA and a
copy of the invoices requested to be paid.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in accordance with and governed by the
substantive laws of the State of Missouri, without reference to its choice of law rules.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;<I>Other Rights and Remedies</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may
have under RGA&#146;s Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or the Indemnification Statute or otherwise, and
nothing herein shall be deemed to diminish or otherwise restrict Indemnitee&#146;s right to
indemnification under any such other provision. To the extent applicable law or the Articles of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of RGA, as in effect on the date hereof or at any time in the future,
permit greater indemnification than as provided for in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such law or
provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws and this Agreement shall be deemed amended
without any further action by RGA or Indemnitee to grant such greater benefits.

and by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns (including any direct or
indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of
the business and/or assets of RGA), spouses, heirs and personal and legal representatives. RGA
shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger,
consolidation, or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business
and/or assets of RGA, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee,
expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
that RGA would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall
continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director, officer,
employee or agent of RGA or of another enterprise at the request of RGA. This Agreement shall not
be deemed to create any obligation on the part of Indemnitee to continue to serve in any such
capacity. No assignment or succession (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger,
consolidation, or otherwise) shall relieve RGA of its obligations hereunder.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.&nbsp;<I>Agreement to Serve</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnitee agrees to serve and/or continue to serve as an director and/or officer of RGA, at
its will (or under separate agreement, if such agreement now or hereafter exists), so long as he or
she is duly appointed or elected and qualified in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of RGA, any subsidiary of RGA, or any applicable other foreign
or domestic corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or until such time as he or she tenders his or her resignation in writing, provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to create any right to continued
employment by Indemnitee in any capacity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;RGA expressly confirms and agrees that is has entered into this Agreement and assumed the
obligations imposed on RGA hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to become or to continue as a
director and/or officer of RGA and acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
