Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and,  if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all  funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by  (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Axos Bank with the amount of such funds or  (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably  acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date a Loan  Notice with respect to a Revolving Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings  outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full  of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above.  (c) Interest Rates. Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent  pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the  Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  (d) Cashless Settlement Mechanism. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all or the portion of its Loans in connection  with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this  Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative  Agent and such Lender.  (e) Loan Account.  The Administrative Agent, without the request of any Loan Party  Borrower, may advance any interest, fee, service charge (including direct wire fees), expenses, or other  payment to which any Secured Party is entitled from the Loan Parties pursuant hereto or any other Loan  Document and may charge the same to the Loan Account notwithstanding that an Overadvance may result  thereby.  The Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower of any such advance or charge promptly after  the making thereof.  Such action on the part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s rights and the Borrower&#8217;s obligations under Section 2.05(b)(vi).  Any amount  which is added to the principal balance of the Loan Account as provided in this Section 2.02(e) shall bear  interest at the interest rate then and thereafter applicable to Base Rate Loans.  (f) Overadvances.  The Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Swingline Lender and  the L/C Issuer shall have no obligation to make any Loan or to provide any Letter of Credit if an  Overadvance would result.  The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, make Permitted Overadvances  without the consent of the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer and the  Loan Parties and each Lender and L/C Issuer shall be bound thereby.  Any Permitted Overadvance may  constitute a Swingline Loan. A Permitted Overadvance is for the account of the Borrower and shall  constitute a Base Rate Loan and an Obligation and shall be repaid by the Borrower in accordance with the  provisions of Section 2.05(b)(vi).  The making of any such Permitted Overadvance on any one occasion  shall not obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make or permit any Permitted Overadvance  </FONT></DIV>

The making by the  Administrative Agent of a Permitted Overadvance shall not modify or abrogate any of the provisions of  Section 2.03 regarding the Lenders&#8217; obligations to purchase participations with respect to Letters of Credit  or of Section 2.04 regarding the Lenders&#8217; obligations to purchase participations with respect to Swingline  Loans.  The Administrative Agent shall have no liability for, and no Loan Party or Secured Party shall have  the right to, or shall, bring any claim of any kind whatsoever against the Administrative Agent with respect  to Unintentional Overadvances regardless of the amount of any such Overadvance(s).  2.03 Letters of Credit.  (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth  herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request that the L/C Issuer,  in reliance on the agreements of the Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, issue or cause the  Underlying Issuer to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Letters of  Credit denominated in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency for its own account or the account of any of  its Subsidiaries in such form as is acceptable to the L/C Issuer in its reasonable determination. Letters of  Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Revolving Commitments.  If the L/C Issuer, at its  option, elects to cause an Underlying Issuer to issue a requested Letter of Credit, then the L/C Issuer agrees  that it will obligate itself to reimburse such Underlying Issuer (which may include, among, other means, by  becoming an applicant with respect to such Letter of Credit or entering into undertakings which provide for  reimbursements of such Underlying Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit; each such obligation or  undertaking, irrespective of whether in writing, a &#8220;Reimbursement Undertaking&#8221;) with respect to Letters of  Credit issued by such Underlying Issuer.  By submitting a request to Issuing Lender for the issuance of a  Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that the L/C Issuer issue or that an Underlying  Issuer issue the requested Letter of Credit and to have requested the L/C Issuer to issue a Reimbursement  Undertaking with respect to such requested Letter of Credit if it is to be issued by an Underlying Issuer (it  being expressly acknowledged and agreed by the Borrower that the Borrower is and shall be deemed to be  an applicant (within the meaning of Section 5-102(a)(2) of the Code) with respect to each Underlying Letter  of Credit).  (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Extension, Reinstatement or Renewal.   (i) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment of the  terms and conditions, extension of the terms and conditions, extension of the expiration date, or  reinstatement of amounts paid, or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall  deliver (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved  by the L/C Issuer) to the L/C Issuer and to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at  least two (2) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C  Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date  or date of amendment, as the case may be a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or  identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended, reinstated or renewed, and specifying the  date of issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (which shall be a Business Day),  the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.03(d)), the  amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, the purpose and  nature of the requested Letter of Credit, the requested currency for such Letter of Credit, and such  other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, extend, reinstate or renew such Letter  of Credit. If requested by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application  and reimbursement agreement on the L/C Issuer&#8217;s standard form in connection with any request for  a Letter of Credit.

(ii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application  (or the amendment of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer may,  in its respective sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension  provisions (each, an &#8220;Auto-Extension Letter of Credit&#8221;); provided that any such Auto-Extension  Letter of Credit shall permit the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable, to prevent any  such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance  of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the  &#8220;Non-Extension Notice Date&#8221;) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon by the  Borrower and the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable, at the time such Letter of  Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable,  the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer or the Underlying  Issuer, as applicable, for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been  issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C  Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable, to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at  any time to an expiration date not later than the date permitted pursuant to Section 2.03(d);  provided, that the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable, shall not (A) permit any such  extension if (1) the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable, has determined that it would  not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its  extended form under the terms hereof (except that the expiration date may be extended to a date  that is no more than one (1) year from the then-current expiration date) or (2) it has received notice  (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on or before the day  that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative  Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (B) be obligated to  permit such extension if it has received notice (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly  confirmed in writing)) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non- Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender or the Borrower that  one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each  such case directing the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer, as applicable, not to permit such  extension.  (c) Limitations on Amounts, Issuance and Amendment.   (i) A Letter of Credit or a Reimbursement Undertaking in respect of an  Underlying Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, extended, reinstated or renewed only if (and  upon issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal of each Letter of Credit or  Reimbursement Undertaking the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after  giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (x) the aggregate  L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (y) the Revolving Exposure of any  Lender shall not exceed its Revolving Commitment and (z) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall  not exceed the Loan Cap.  (ii) Neither of the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer shall be under any  obligation to issue any Letter of Credit or a Reimbursement Undertaking if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or  arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer or the Underlying  Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit or Reimbursement Undertaking, or any Law  applicable to the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer or any request or directive (whether  </FONT></DIV>

(ii) In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving  Lender hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent in Dollars, for account of the L/C Issuer, such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of each L/C  Disbursement made by the L/C Issuer (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent  thereof) not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the notice provided by the  Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.03(f) until such L/C  Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is  required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, including after the Maturity Date. Such  payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each  such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02 with respect to Loans  made by such Lender (and Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations  of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.03), and the Administrative Agent shall  promptly pay to the L/C Issuer the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following  receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03(f),  the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the L/C Issuer or, to the extent that the  Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse the L/C Issuer,  then to such Lenders and the L/C Issuer as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a  Lender pursuant to this Section 2.03(e) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any L/C Disbursement shall  not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C  Disbursement.  (iii) Each Revolving Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its  participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender&#8217;s  Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit  at each time such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment is amended as a result of an assignment in  accordance with Section 11.06 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement.  (iv) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to  the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(e), then, without limiting the other provisions of this  Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the  Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date  such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C  Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by  the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any  administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with  the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so  paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing  or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.

(p) Replacement of the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer.  The L/C Issuer or the  Underlying Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer or Underlying Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer or  Underlying Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the L/C  Issuer or Underlying Issuer.

Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as  collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this  Agreement. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or clause (d) of this Section 2.03, if any  L/C Obligations remain outstanding after the expiration date specified in said clause (d), the  Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105%  of the Dollar Equivalent of such L/C Obligations as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid  interest thereon.

(r) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit  issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary,  the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse, indemnify and compensate the L/C Issuer or the Underlying  Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit as if such Letter of Credit had been  issues solely for the account of the Borrower.

The Loan Parties hereby authorize and direct any Underlying Issuer to deliver to the L/C  Issuer all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by such Underlying Issuer  pursuant to such Underlying Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon the Issuing Lender&#8217;s instructions  with respect to all matters arising in connection with such Underlying Letter of Credit and the Letter of  Credit Application.

Each such Swingline Loan  may be made, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to the Borrower, in Dollars, from time to  time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time  outstanding the amount of the Swingline Sublimit; provided, however, that (i) after giving effect to any  Swingline Loan, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Loan Cap at such time, and  (B) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender at such time shall not exceed such Lender&#8217;s  Revolving Commitment, (ii) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance  any outstanding Swingline Loan, and (iii) the Swingline Lender shall not be under any obligation to make  any Swingline Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent  manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing  limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section  2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and re-borrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swingline Loan shall bear  interest only at a rate based on the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans.

(b) Borrowing Procedures.  Each Swingline Borrowing shall be made upon the  Borrower&#8217;s irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given  by: (i) telephone or (iii) a Swingline Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed  immediately by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swingline Loan Notice.  Each such Swingline Loan Notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent  not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date and shall specify (A) the amount to be borrowed,  which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (B) the requested date of the Borrowing (which shall be a  Business Day). Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any Swingline Loan Notice, the  Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the  Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will  notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline  Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the  request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing  (1) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth  in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (2) that one or more of the applicable  conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the  Swingline Lender may, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Borrower at its office by  crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swingline Lender in immediately available funds.  (c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans.  (i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on  behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on  its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender&#8217;s  Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request  shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes  hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum  and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the  unutilized portion of the Revolving Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The  Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly  after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an  amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice  available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative  Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the  account of the Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice,  whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available  shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The  Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender.  (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if for any  reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance  with Section 2.04(c)(i) (including, without limitation, the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth  in Section 4.02), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth  herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders  fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Lender&#8217;s payment to  the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i)  shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.  </FONT></DIV>

If such Lender pays such amount (with interest  and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Loan included  in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the  case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the  Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c)(iii) shall be  conclusive absent manifest error.  (iv) Each Revolving Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to  purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be  absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,  counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the  Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence  or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar  to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lender&#8217;s obligation to make  Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section  4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such funding of risk participations  shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together  with interest as provided herein.  (d) Repayment of Participations.  (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk  participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of  such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable  Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender.  (ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal  or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of  the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by  the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender  its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest  thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal  to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of  the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the Facility  Termination Date.  (e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender. The Swingline Lender shall be  responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender  funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving  Lender&#8217;s Applicable Revolving Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable  Revolving Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.  </FONT></DIV>

Except as otherwise provided in Section  2.15, prepayments of the Revolving Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), first, shall be  applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings and the Swingline Loans, second, shall be applied to the  outstanding Revolving Loans, and, third, shall be used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C  Obligations; and, in the case of prepayments of the Revolving Facility required pursuant to clauses  (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 2.05(b), the amount remaining, if any, after the prepayment in  full of all L/C Borrowings, Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans outstanding at such time and the  Cash Collateralization of the remaining L/C Obligations in full (the sum of such prepayment  amounts, Cash Collateralization amounts and remaining amount being, collectively, the &#8220;Reduction  Amount&#8221;) may be retained by the Borrower for use in the ordinary course of its business. Upon the  drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral  shall be applied (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan  Party or any Defaulting Lender that has provided Cash Collateral) to reimburse the L/C Issuer, the  Underlying Issuer or the Revolving Lenders, as applicable.  Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments pursuant to this Section  2.05(b) shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to SOFR Loans. All prepayments under this  Section 2.05(b) shall be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be  accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.  </FONT></DIV>

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate  the Revolving Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit, or from time to time  permanently reduce the Revolving Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit;  provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.  five (5) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be  in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower  shall not terminate or reduce (A) the Revolving Facility if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent  prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed the Loan Cap, (B) the Letter of  Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations not fully Cash  Collateralized hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or (C) the Swingline Sublimit if, after  giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Outstanding Amount of Swingline  Loans would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, and (iv) at no time shall the Aggregate Revolving  Commitments be less than $50,000,000.   (b) Mandatory. If after giving effect to any reduction or termination of Revolving  Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or the Swingline Sublimit exceeds the  Revolving Facility at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit, as the case may  be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  (c) Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees. The Administrative  Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit,  Swingline Sublimit or the Revolving Commitment under this Section 2.06. Upon any reduction of the  Revolving Commitments, the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender shall be reduced by such  Lender&#8217;s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such Reduction Amount. All fees in respect of the Revolving  Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Facility shall be paid on the  effective date of such termination.  Contemporaneously with any reduction or termination of the Revolving  Commitments, the Borrower shall pay such fees as are required to be paid on account of such reduction or  termination pursuant to the Fee Letter.  2.07 Repayment of Loans.  (a) Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Revolving Lenders on the  Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding  on such date.  (b) Swingline Loans. The Borrower shall repay each Swingline Loan on the earlier to  occur of (i) the date ten (10) Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date for the  Revolving Facility.  2.08 Interest and Default Rate.

(b) Default Rate.  (i) All outstanding Obligations (including Letter of Credit Maintenance Fees,  but excluding Letter of Credit Fees) shall bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all  times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws (x) while an  Event of Default of the type described in Section 8.01(a), (f) or (g) exists, or (y) upon the request  of the Required Lenders or at the election of the Administrative Agent, while any other Event of  Default exists.  (ii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on  past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.  (c) Interest Payments. Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on  each Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder  shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and  after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.  2.09 Fees.  In addition to certain fees described in clauses (m), (n) and (p) of Section 2.03:  (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account or for the  account of the Lenders, as the case may be, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  (b) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately  agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when  paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees.    (a) Certain Computation Matters.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans  (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Daily Simple SOFR) shall be made on the basis of  a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and  interest, including those with respect to SOFR Loans, shall be made on the basis of a three hundred sixty  (360) day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than  if computed on the basis of a 365 day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the  Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such  portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to  Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest  rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  (b) Canadian Interest Matters.  For purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and  disclosure thereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be paid hereunder or under any other Loan  Document is to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year or any other period of time less than a calendar  year, the yearly rate of interest or fees to which the rate used in such calculation is equivalent, is the rate so  used multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or such  other period of time. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest  calculation under this Agreement and the rates of interest stipulated in this Agreement are intended to be  nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.  </FONT></DIV>

The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be  evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Loan  Account&#8221;) in the ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in  accordance with Section 11.06(c). In addition, each Lender may record in such Lender&#8217;s internal records,  an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan from such Lender, each payment and  prepayment of principal of any such Loan, and each payment of interest, fees and other amounts due in  connection with the Obligations due to such Lender.  The accounts or records maintained by the  Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit  Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so  record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower  hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between  the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative  Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the  absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the  Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall  evidence such Lender&#8217;s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules  to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and  payments with respect thereto.  (b) Maintenance of Records. In addition to the accounts and records referred to in  Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual  practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters  of Credit and Swingline Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained  by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the  accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent&#8217;s Clawback.  (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of  and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as  otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the  Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, in Dollars  in the United States and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other  applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such  Lender&#8217;s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be  deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to  accrue. Subject to Section 2.07(a) and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any  payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be  made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing  interest or fees, as the case may be.    (b) (1) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the  Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing  of SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of  such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share  of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available  on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such  Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and  </FONT></DIV>

In such  event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative  Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent  forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for  each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the  date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender,  the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with  banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees  customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of  a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and  such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the  Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the  Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative  Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any  payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender  that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  (i) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless  the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which  any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or  the Underlying Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative  Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith  and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders, the L/C Issuer  or the Underlying Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. With respect to any payment that the  Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or the Underlying Issuer  hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be  conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the  &#8220;Rescindable Amount&#8221;): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the  Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by such Borrower  (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise  erroneously made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders, the L/C Issuer or the  Underlying Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent  forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Underlying  Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the  date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative  Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent  in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any  amount owing under this clause (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the  Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions  of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent  because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived  in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as  received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make  Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments  pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint.

(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain  the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender  that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.  (f) Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available  to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then  due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder,  ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to  such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, ratably  among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings then  due to such parties.

If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff  or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations due and payable to such Lender  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the  proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the  aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan  Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lenders  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or  (b) Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan  Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such  Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of  the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan  Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all  Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such  time, then, in each case under clauses (a) and (b) above, the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall  (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in  the Loans and sub-participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans of the other Lenders, or make  such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the  Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations then due and payable to the  Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that:  </FONT></DIV>

Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower at any time that the  Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit  then in effect, then within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall provide  Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount  by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit.  (b) Specified Cash Collateral.  As and when required pursuant to the L/C Transition  Schedule with respect to Letters of Credit replacing the Existing L/Cs (or, with respect to each Letter of  Credit issued hereunder that is not replacing an Existing L/C, contemporaneously with the issuance thereof),  the Borrower shall deposit into an account established and maintained on the books and records of the  Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Specified Collateral Account&#8221;) such amounts as are required for such  replacement Letters of Credit pursuant to the L/C Transition Schedule (or, with respect to each Letter of  Credit issued hereunder that is not replacing an Existing L/C, an amount equal to 105% of the Dollar  Equivalent of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative  Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations.  In addition, and without limiting  the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement with respect to Cash Collateral, if any Event of  Default occurs as a result of a breach of Section 7.11 hereof (a &#8220;Financial Covenant Event of Default&#8221;), the  Borrower shall, upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s request, deposit into the Specified Collateral Account an  additional amount equal to the difference, if a positive number, between the then amount of Specified Cash  Collateral maintained by the Administrative Agent hereunder and 105% of the Dollar Equivalent of the  then Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion  and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Specified Collateral Account.

(c) Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any  Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the  Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Underlying Issuer  and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts  and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as Collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds  of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral or Specified Cash  Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.14(d).

All Cash Collateral  and Specified Cash Collateral (in each case other than credit support not constituting funds subject to  deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at Axos Bank. The Borrower  shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other  administrative fees and charges of Axos Bank and the Administrative Agent in connection with the  maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral and Specified Cash Collateral.

(e) Release of Cash Collateral.

(C) Defaulting Lender Fees. With respect to any fee payable under  Section 2.09 or any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender  pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting  Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with  respect to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans  that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (2)  pay to the L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee  otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer&#8217;s or  Swingline Lender&#8217;s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required  to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.

Subject to Section 11.20, no reallocation hereunder shall  constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender  arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non- Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s increased exposure following such  reallocation.

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline  Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the  Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such  notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any  Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans  of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary  to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be  held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Commitments (without giving effect to  Section 2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no  adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of  the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent  otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender  will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender&#8217;s having  been a Defaulting Lender.  </FONT></DIV>

Solely for  the purposes of this clause (f)(ii)(D), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to  FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered  pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall  update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in  writing of its legal inability to do so.

Unless required by Applicable Laws, at no time  shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or  have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for  the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its Permitted Discretion, that it has received a  refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any  Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Loan Party an  amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts  paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net  of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, as the case may be, and without  interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),  provided that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to  such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental  Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental  Authority.

Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the  amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  3.03 Circumstances Affecting Benchmark Availability, Etc.   (a) Circumstances Affecting Benchmark Availability.  If for any reason (i) the  Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest  error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable market or at the applicable rate  of the then Benchmark for the applicable amount and Interest Period, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall  determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and  adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the Benchmark for such Interest Period or (iii) the Required  Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that  the Benchmark does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining the  Loans bearing interest based on the Benchmark during such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent  shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the  Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist or a Benchmark Replacement is implemented with respect  to the then-applicable Benchmark, on the last day of the then current Interest Period, such Loans shall  accrue interest based on the Base Rate.  (b) Conversion to Base Rate Loans upon Default.  Unless the Administrative Agent  shall otherwise and in its sole but good faith discretion consent in writing, if (i) an Event of Default (with  respect to any payment obligation or otherwise, as may be defined or described in this Agreement or related  documents) has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) there exists a condition or event that, with the passage of  time, the giving of notice, or both, shall constitute such an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, in  its sole but good faith discretion, may convert outstanding SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans. Nothing herein  shall be construed to be a waiver by the Administrative Agent of its right to have the outstanding principal  balance accrue interest at the Default Rate, accelerate the indebtedness and/or exercise any other remedies  available to Administrative Agent under the terms hereof or Applicable Law.  (c) Repayment Upon Conversion to Base Rate. Except as otherwise provided herein,  during the time of any conversion of SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans, whether temporary or permanent,  and whether pursuant to an Event of Default or otherwise, and without compromising any other rights and  remedies of the Administrative Agent, and in the absence of the Administrative Agent exercising any such  other rights or remedies as may be applicable, the Borrower shall continue to repay all Obligations in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The determination by the Administrative Agent of the  foregoing amounts shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower.  (d) Assumptions Concerning Funding of Benchmark Loans.  Calculation of all  amounts payable to a Lender under Articles II and III shall be made as though such Lender had actually  funded Benchmark Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the  rate applicable to such Benchmark Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the Benchmark Loans and  having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may  </FONT></DIV>

(e) Inability to Determine SOFR; Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.  If the  Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on  Borrower absent manifest error) that for any reason SOFR cannot be determined, other than as a result of a  Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent will give notice of such determination to Borrower.  Thereafter, the Administrative Agent may not make or maintain the loans hereunder based on Term SOFR  until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing, and until such revocation, the Administrative  Agent may convert existing SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans, subject to the provisions below.  (i) Benchmark Replacement.

Each of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Underlying Issuer  hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Axos Bank to act on its behalf as the Administrative  Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take  such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the  terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The  provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the L/C  Issuer and the Underlying Issuer, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a  third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221;  herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative  Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency  doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to  create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.  In addition, to the extent  required under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States, each of the Lenders and other  Secured Parties hereby grants to the Administrative Agent any required powers of attorney to execute any  Collateral Document or other Loan Document governed by the laws of such jurisdiction on such Lender&#8217;s  or other Secured Party&#8217;s behalf.  (b) Collateral Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also act as the &#8220;collateral agent&#8221;  under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Bank Product  Provider, and a potential Cash Management Bank), the L/C Issuer and the Underlying Issuer hereby  irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender, the L/C  Issuer and the Underlying Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on  Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such  powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as  &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative  Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any  portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies  thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of  this Article IX and Article XI (including Section 11.04(c), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and  attorneys-in-fact were the &#8220;collateral agent&#8221; under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with  respect thereto.  9.02 Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have  the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as  though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; or &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall, unless otherwise  expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the  Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept  deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity  for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial, advisory, underwriting or other business  with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the  Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or to provide  notice to or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto.  </FONT></DIV>

To the extent permitted hereby, the Loan  Parties may enter into Bank Product Agreements or Cash Management Agreements with any applicable  Cash Management Bank or Bank Product Provider, as the case may be, although the Loan Parties are not  required to do so.

(i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than (w) unless an  Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such sale, any Disqualified  Institution, (x) a natural Person or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned  and operated for the primary benefit of one or more natural Persons, or (y) a Defaulting Lender, or  (z) the Borrower or any of the Borrower&#8217;s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) in all  or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a  portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender&#8217;s participations in  L/C Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender&#8217;s obligations  under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to  the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Underlying Issuer shall continue to deal  solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under  this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity  under Section 11.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participations.  (ii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a  participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement  and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the  consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the  first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant.

Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request  and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions  of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant  also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such  Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells  a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower,  maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal  amounts (and interest amounts) of each Participant&#8217;s interest in the Loans or other obligations under  the Loan Documents (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any  obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any  Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters  of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that  such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other  obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103&#8211;1(c) of the United States Treasury  Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and  such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner  of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)  shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest  in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note or Notes, if any) to secure  obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve  Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations  hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  (f) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Axos Bank assigns all of its Revolving Commitment  and Revolving Loans pursuant to clause (b) above, Axos Bank may, (i) upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to the  Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days&#8217;  notice to the Borrower, resign as Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or  Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer  or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such  successor shall affect the resignation of Axos Bank as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

If Axos Bank resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided  for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such  resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations  in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

(a) Treatment of Certain Information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders  and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that  Information may be disclosed (i) to its Affiliates, its auditors and its Related Parties (it being understood  that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such  Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent required or requested  by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including  any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (iii) to the  extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any  other party hereto, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan  Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the  enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions  substantially the same as those of this Section 11.07, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any  prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (B) any  actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which  payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments  hereunder, (vii) on a confidential basis to (A) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or  its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (B) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar  agency in connection with the application, issuance, publishing and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other  market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, or (viii) with the consent of the  Borrower or to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach  of this Section 11.07, (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any  of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (C) is  independently discovered or developed by a party hereto without utilizing any Information received from  the Borrower or violating the terms of this Section 11.07. For purposes of this Section 11.07, &#8220;Information&#8221;  means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any  Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the  Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the  Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any  Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.07 shall  be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of  care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential  information. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this  Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the  lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the  administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Revolving Commitments.

The Loan Parties and their Affiliates agree that they will not in the  future issue any press releases or other public disclosure using the name of the Administrative Agent or any  Lender or their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents without  the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, unless (and only to the extent that) the Loan Parties  or such Affiliate is required to do so under law and then, in any event the Loan Parties or such Affiliate will  consult with such Person before issuing such press release or other public disclosure.  (d) Customary Advertising Material. The Loan Parties consent to the publication by  the Administrative Agent or any Lender of customary advertising material relating to the transactions  contemplated hereby using the name, product photographs, logo or trademark of the Loan Parties.  11.08 Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender,  the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time,  after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by  Applicable Law to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional  or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time  owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower  or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party now or  hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, the L/C Issuer or such  Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any  demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower  or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured, secured or unsecured, or are owed to a branch, office  or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such  deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall  exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the  Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending  such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust  for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender  shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Secured  Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of  each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section 11.08 are in addition to other  rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective  Affiliates may have under Applicable Law. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower  and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to  give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.   11.09 Interest Rate Limitation.

If the Administrative Agent or  any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be  applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In  determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a  Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,  (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest,  (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread  in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations  hereunder.  11.10 Integration; Effectiveness.
