<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, Global Indemnity Cayman also confirms the arrangements under which Fox Paine agrees to
provide to Global Indemnity Cayman and its affiliates financial advice and assistance in the event
of a possible Change of Control transaction, including, as appropriate, advice and assistance with
respect to defining objectives, performing valuation analyses and structuring, planning and
negotiating any such transaction (the &#147;Advisory Services&#148;). Global Indemnity Cayman understands
that Fox Paine would not be providing (nor would Global Indemnity Cayman and its affiliates be
relying on it for) tax, regulatory, legal or accounting advice in connection with a Change of
Control and that Fox Paine is not rendering any formal opinions to Global Indemnity Cayman with
respect to the Advisory Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If a Change of Control is consummated, Global Indemnity Cayman agrees to pay Fox Paine, upon the
consummation of the Change of Control an amount in cash equal to the product of (a)&nbsp;1.0% times (b)
the Transaction Value (the &#147;Transaction Fee&#148;). &#147;Transaction Value&#148; means with respect to a Change
of Control involving (i)&nbsp;the voting stock of Global Indemnity, the total value of (A)&nbsp;the
consideration paid per Global Indemnity voting share of each class multiplied by the total number
of Global Indemnity voting shares of each class outstanding (including the number of voting shares
that would be outstanding upon exercise, conversion, redemption or exchange of any in-the-money
securities, including options, warrants, convertible debt and convertible preferred stock) of
Global Indemnity but net of any proceeds received by Global Indemnity upon the exercise of any
options or warrants and (B)&nbsp;any capital distribution to the shareholders of Global Indemnity,
including extraordinary dividends, share repurchases, self tender offers or other forms of
returning capital to shareholders, that is expressly provided for in the Change of Control
documentation and is conditioned upon the consummation of the Change of Control (or, conversely,
the Change of Control is conditioned upon completion of such return of capital), and (ii)&nbsp;any sale
of assets or any other transaction not involving the voting stock of Global Indemnity, the total
value of (A)&nbsp;all cash, securities, assets and other property paid, directly or indirectly, by a
buyer to Global Indemnity or, if applicable, a subsidiary of Global Indemnity in connection with a
Change of Control or, in the case of a partnership, joint or collaborative venture or similar
arrangement, the total value of all cash, securities, assets and other property, directly or
indirectly, paid or contributed by Global Indemnity or, if applicable, a subsidiary of Global
Indemnity to such venture, excluding any subsequent capital contributions to fund such venture&#146;s
operations and (B)&nbsp;any capital distribution to the shareholder(s) of Global Indemnity or, if
applicable, a subsidiary of Global Indemnity, including extraordinary dividends, share repurchases,
self tender offers or other forms of returning capital to shareholders, that is expressly provided
for in the Change of Control documentation and is conditioned upon the completion of the Change of
Control (or, conversely, the Change of Control is conditioned upon completion of such return of
capital). For purposes of
determining the Transaction Fee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Global Indemnity
shall reasonably determine the Transaction Value so as not to &#147;double count&#148; the proceeds of any
transaction or series of transactions that has been consummated prior to the consummation of a
Change of Control transaction. Notwithstanding anything in this letter agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall more than one Change of Control Fee be payable under the terms of this letter
agreement.
