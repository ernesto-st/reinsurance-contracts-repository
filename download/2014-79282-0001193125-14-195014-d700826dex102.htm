success. Executive&#146;s role in the M&amp;A Process is one of confidence and trust with the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(f) The Company shall indemnify,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) Executive&#146;s compensation shall be as agreed and set forth herein. Any modifications to Executive&#146;s compensation shall be as
agreed between Company and Executive from time to time, subject to withholding for state and federal income tax, FICA, FUTA, SUTA, and other required statutory deductions. Executive&#146;s starting annual salary shall be $500,000.00, less applicable
deductions and pro-rated for time employed in 2014 (&#147;Base Salary&#148;), payable in installments in accordance with the Company&#146;s normal payroll practices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) In addition to Base Salary, Executive shall be eligible to receive a performance-based bonus with an estimated base bonus amount of
$350,000.00 for calendar year 2014 and pro-rated for time employed in 2014 provided that Executive remains continuously employed by the Company from date of hire until the bonus payment date and payable with normal bonus payments in the first
quarter of 2015 (&#147;Base Bonus&#148;). Like Executive&#146;s Base Salary, the Base Bonus will be reviewed annually by the Company&#146;s Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. The performance-based goals will be established by the
CEO. In addition, consistent with the Base Bonuses for all of the Company&#146;s executive officers, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion and in the event the Company&#146;s financial performance is unexpectedly poor or in the event
that Executive commits an act of malfeasance, may reduce or eliminate this Base Bonus. Finally and for the avoidance of doubt, while the Base Bonus amount, performance-based goals and pro-ration for 2014 will differ from the Company&#146;s other
executive officers, the mechanics and process of the calculation of the performance-based bonus will be the same as that for the Company&#146;s other executive officers for 2014 and future years. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(i) Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (A)&nbsp;the Company has recognized Executive&#146;s merit and has hired Executive to the
executive leadership of the Company; (B)&nbsp;the Company has permitted and encouraged Executive&#146;s interaction and the development of relationships with persons and entities in the Insurance Business and third party stock analysts, Company
shareholders and Company directors; (C)&nbsp;the Company has long-term relationships with its Client Accounts and Restricted Third Parties and that those relationships were in many instances developed at considerable expense and difficulty to the
Company over several years of close and continuing involvement and that the Company is acquiring at considerable expense the benefits and goodwill associated with such relationships; (D)&nbsp;Executive has carefully considered, and agrees that the
provisions of this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> are fair, reasonable, and not unduly restrictive on Executive, and do not preclude Executive from earning a livelihood or unreasonably impose limitations on Executive&#146;s ability to earn a living;
(E)&nbsp;the potential harm to the Company and its Affiliates of the non-enforcement of any provision of this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> outweighs any potential harm to Executive of its enforcement by injunction or otherwise; and (F)&nbsp;Executive has
had an opportunity to obtain legal advice before agreeing to these terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(ii) Executive agrees that the Company shall have the right to
communicate the terms of this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> after the Separation Date to any prospective or current employer of Executive. Executive waives any right to assert any claim for damages against Company or any officer, employee or agent of the
Company arising from such disclosure of the terms of this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(iii) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the
provisions of this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B>, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief as well as any other applicable remedies at law or in equity. Executive understands and agrees that without such protection, the Company&#146;s business
would be irreparably harmed, and that the remedy of monetary damages alone would be inadequate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(iv) Executive acknowledges that the
purposes of this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> would be frustrated by measuring the period of restriction from the Separation Date where Executive failed to honor the Agreement during the Restricted Period, as applicable, until directed to do so by court
order. Therefore, should Executive violate this Agreement and should legal proceedings have to be brought by the Company against Executive to enforce this Agreement, the period of restriction under this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> shall be deemed to be
extended for a period equal to the period of violation by Executive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(v) The provisions of this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> shall be
independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of this
<B>Section&nbsp;4</B> by the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(vi) It is the intention of the Parties that the terms and provisions of this Agreement be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties further agree that if a court of competent jurisdiction declares any of the covenants set forth in this <B>Section&nbsp;4</B> unenforceable,
then such court shall be authorized to modify such covenants so as to render the remaining covenants and the modified covenants valid and enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and as so modified, to enforce this Agreement in accordance with
its terms. In accordance with the foregoing, if any provision of this <B>Section&nbsp;4 </B>shall be held to be excessively broad, it shall be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law. This Agreement does not relieve the
Executive of other legal responsibilities and liabilities that Executive has to the Company under applicable state and federal statutes and common law.&nbsp;Instead, Executive acknowledges that this Agreement creates additional rights and
responsibilities for protecting the Company&#146;s interests.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B></B>5. <B><U>Creations</U></B>. Executive irrevocably assigns to the
