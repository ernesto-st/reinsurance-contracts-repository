Closing  Date,  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP and in  accordance  with the
accounting  principles  and  procedures  set  forth  in  Schedule  1.1(a).  Such
financial  statements  shall  include  the  consolidated  balance  sheets of the
Companies (and their  Subsidiaries) as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance
Sheet") and as of  December  31,  2000.  Sellers  shall also  deliver to Buyer a
statement  (the  "Closing  Statement")  setting  forth  the  Book  Value  of the
Companies (and their Subsidiaries) as of December 31, 2000 and as of the Closing
Date.
Within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet
and the balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and the Closing  Statement,  Buyer
may dispute all or any portion of the Closing Statement by giving written notice
to Sellers  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the basis for any such dispute
(any such dispute being hereinafter called a "Book Value  Disagreement").  Buyer
and Sellers  shall  promptly  commence  good faith  negotiations  with a view to
resolving all such Book Value Disagreements.  If Buyer does not give such notice
within the period set forth, Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably  accepted
the  calculation  of Base Book  Value and Final  Book  Value as set forth in the
Closing Statement.
If,  within  thirty  (30) days  following  the  delivery  to Buyer of the notice
pursuant to Section 3.4(b) of such Book Value Disagreement, Buyer and Sellers do
not resolve the Book Value  Disagreement  (as  evidenced by a written  agreement
among the Buyer and Sellers),  such Book Value Disagreement shall be referred to
an  Independent  Accounting  Firm  mutually  selected  by Sellers  and Buyer for
resolution of such Book Value  Disagreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.  If Buyer and Sellers do not  promptly  agree on the  selection of an
Independent  Accounting Firm, their respective  independent  public  accountants
shall  mutually  select  such  firm.  The   determinations  of  the  Independent
Accounting Firm with respect to any Book Value  Disagreement  shall be final and
binding upon Buyer and Sellers, and the calculation of Base Book Value and Final
Book Value so  determined  shall be deemed to be final.  Buyer and Sellers shall
use commercially  reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
render its determination as soon as practicable after referral of the Book Value
Disagreement  to such firm, and Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with such firm
and provide such firm with reasonable access to their books and records and such
other information as such firm may require in order to render its determination.
At the  commencement  of the  engagement,  Buyer and Sellers shall  instruct the
Independent  Accounting Firm to issue a letter to the Escrow Agent (within three
(3) Business  Days  following  the date the Base Book Value and Final Book Value
are finally  determined by such firm),  instructing  the Escrow Agent to release
and disburse the Purchase Price Adjustment  Escrow Amount in accordance with the
Independent  Accounting Firm's final  determination of such amounts.  All of the
fees and expenses of the Independent  Accounting Firm retained  pursuant to this
Section  3.4(c) shall be shared  equally by Buyer and Queensway  Limited.  Final
Settlement. If the Final Book Value of the Companies (and their Subsidiaries) is
less than the Base Book Value, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
difference  between such two amounts.  If the Final Book Value of the  Companies
(and their  Subsidiaries)  is more than the Base Book Value,  Buyer shall pay to
Sellers  (pursuant to the allocation  percentages  set forth in Schedule 2.2) an
amount equal to the difference between such two amounts.  Any payment to be made
pursuant to this  Section 3.5 shall be made by Wire  Transfer  within  three (3)
Business  Days  following  the day on which the Base Book  Value and Final  Book
Value shall have been  finally  determined  pursuant to the terms of Section 3.4
hereof (the "Final Settlement  Date"). If, pursuant to this Section 3.5, Sellers
are required to pay Buyer any amount,  such amount shall first be satisfied  out
of the Escrow (and paid directly by Escrow  Agent),  with any balance being paid
directly by  Sellers.  Any payment  pursuant to this  Section 3.5 shall  include
interest  on such amount for the number of days from and  including  the Closing
Date to, but excluding,  the Final  Settlement Date at a rate per annum equal to
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect from time to time during such period.


REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF SELLERS AND THE COMPANIES
REGARDING THE COMPANIES and their subsidiaries
         Sellers and each Company hereby, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to Buyer as follows:

incorporated,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of its  incorporation.  Each Company has the  corporate  power and  authority to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own all of its assets,
and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each  jurisdiction  in which

by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary. Schedule 4.1 sets forth a
true,  accurate and complete list of each  jurisdiction in which each Company is
so  authorized  and lists the  directors  and  officers of each  Company and its
Subsidiaries. Sellers have delivered to Buyer correct and complete copies of the

board of directors,  and any  committees of the board of  directors),  the stock
certificate  books,  and  the  stock  record  books  of  each  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries are correct and complete.  No Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
in default under or in violation of any provision of its charter or bylaws.

Noncontravention. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.2, neither the execution and
the  delivery  of this  Agreement,  nor  the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  will (a) violate any constitution,  statute,  regulation,
rule,  injunction,  judgment,  order,  decree,  ruling,  charge, or other Law or
restriction  of any  government,  governmental  agency,  or court  to which  any
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or any provision of the charter or
bylaws of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) conflict with, result in
a breach of,  constitute a default under,  result in the acceleration of, create
in any party the right to accelerate,  terminate,  modify, or cancel, or require
any notice under any agreement,  Contract, lease, license,  instrument, or other
arrangement  to which any  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  is a party or by
which it is bound or to which any of its  assets is  subject  (or  result in the
imposition of any security interest upon any of its assets). Except as set forth
in Schedule 4.2, no Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  is required to give any
notice  to,  make any filing  with,  or obtain any  authorization,  consent,  or
approval of any government or  governmental  agency or any other Person in order
for the  Companies  (or  their  Subsidiaries)  to  consummate  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
Capitalization.  Schedule 4.3 sets forth a true,  accurate and complete  list of
the authorized,  issued, and outstanding  capital stock of each Company.  All of
the Shares have been duly  authorized,  are  validly  issued,  fully  paid,  and

There are no  outstanding  or authorized  options,  warrants,  purchase  rights,
subscription rights,  conversion rights,  exchange rights, or other Contracts or
commitments that would require any Company to issue, sell, or otherwise cause to
become  outstanding  any of its  capital  stock.  There  are no  outstanding  or
authorized stock appreciation,  phantom stock, profit participation,  or similar
rights with  respect to any Company.  There are no voting  trusts,  proxies,  or
other  agreements  or  understandings  with respect to the voting of the capital
stock of any Company.
Subsidiaries.
The identity of each Company's Subsidiaries,  their respective  jurisdictions of
organization,  their authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock,
and the owners of their capital stock are set forth in Schedule  4.4(a).  Except
as set forth in Schedule 4.4(a),  all of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Subsidiaries of each Company are owned beneficially and of record by such
Company,  free and clear of any Encumbrances.  All of the outstanding  shares of
capital stock of each  Subsidiary  have been duly  authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable.  There is no outstanding option,  warrant,
right,  subscription,  call,  unsatisfied preemptive right or other agreement of
any kind to purchase or otherwise acquire from any Subsidiary or any Company any
capital stock of any Subsidiary,  whether issued or outstanding,  authorized but
unissued,  or treasury shares.  Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized,
validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  Laws  of  its  state  of
incorporation  or domicile and has the corporate power and authority to carry on
its businesses as now being conducted,  and to own, lease and operate all of its
respective  properties and assets. Each Subsidiary is duly licensed or qualified
to do  business  in each  jurisdiction  in  which  the  nature  of the  business
conducted  by it or  the  character  of  the  assets  owned  by  it  makes  such
qualification  or  licensing  necessary.  Schedule  4.4(a)  sets  forth  a true,
accurate and complete list of all jurisdictions in which the Subsidiaries are so
licensed or  qualified.  There  exists no  restriction,  other than  pursuant to
applicable  Laws,  on the payment of cash  dividends  by any  Subsidiary  of any
Company.
Except  (i) as  set  forth  in  Schedule  4.4(b),  (ii)  for  the  stock  of the
Subsidiaries,  and (iii) for portfolio  investments,  there are no corporations,

Subsidiary is a member of (nor does it conduct any part of its business through)
any partnership or other Person. Financial Statements.

and to any other jurisdiction where required on forms prescribed or permitted by

compliance  with all  applicable  Laws when  filed and,  as of their  respective
dates, did not contain any false statements or misstatements of material fact or

Insurance Company or Insurance Subsidiary by any regulatory  commission,  agency
or  authority  with  respect  to  such  filings  or  submissions.  Sellers  have

Governmental  Authorities  ("Permits  ")  held  by  any  Company  or  any of its
Subsidiaries  for the use of their  respective  properties  and  assets  and the
conduct of their respective businesses.  Except as set forth in Schedule 4.8(a),
each Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  holds all Permits  necessary for the
lawful  ownership  and use of their  respective  properties  and  assets and the

Subsidiaries  has received any notice that any violation exists or is alleged to
exist with  respect to any such  Permit,  and no  proceeding  is pending  or, to

Authority  in the  regular  course of the  business of the  Companies  and their
Subsidiaries,  during  the last five (5)  years no  Governmental  Authority  has
initiated any proceeding with respect to, or investigation  into the business or

forth a true,  accurate  and  complete  list of each  jurisdiction  in which any
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is licensed to transact  insurance  business.
Each Insurance Company and Insurance Subsidiary (i) is an authorized insurer (on
either an admitted or a  nonadmitted  basis) in each state in which it presently
writes  insurance  for the type of insurance it presently  writes in such states
and (ii) meets all statutory and  regulatory  requirements  of all  Governmental
Authorities  which  have  jurisdiction  over it to be an  authorized  insurer on
either an  admitted  or a  nonadmitted  basis.  Except as set forth in  Schedule
4.8(d),  there is no proceeding or investigation  pending or, to Sellers' or the
Companies'  Knowledge,  threatened which would reasonably be expected to lead to
the  revocation,   amendment,  failure  to  renew,  limitation,   suspension  or

are in the course of settlement in accordance with such Insurance  Company's (or
Insurance Subsidiary's) standard procedures,  except for such benefits for which
there is a reasonable  basis to contest payment and which are being or have been
contested by appropriate proceedings and in accordance with applicable Law.

No  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or  either  Seller  has  received  any
information  which  would  reasonably  cause it to  believe  that the  financial
condition of any other party to any  reinsurance,  coinsurance  or other similar
agreement with any Insurance  Company or Insurance  Subsidiary is so impaired as
to result in a default thereunder.

All  advertising,  promotional,  sales and  solicitation  materials  and product
illustrations used by any Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any agent of any
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  have complied and are in compliance with all
applicable Laws.

Schedule  4.9(b) sets forth a true,  accurate and complete  list of all managing

produced by such insurance  agent) in the particular  jurisdiction in which such
agent wrote,  sold or produced such business and was properly  appointed by such
Insurance Company or Insurance Subsidiary.  All written contracts and agreements
between  any  general  agent (or  subagent  thereof),  on the one hand,  and any
Insurance Company or Insurance Subsidiary, on the other hand, are (and have been
at all times) in material  compliance with all applicable Laws and  regulations.
To Sellers' or the  Companies'  Knowledge,  no such  general  agent (or subagent
thereof) is the subject of, or party to action or  proceeding  under  applicable
Law. As of the date hereof,  no Insurance  Company or Insurance  Subsidiary  has

relationship with any Insurance  Company or Insurance  Subsidiary as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Company  or  Insurance  Subsidiary  or  indicated  to any  Insurance  Company or
Insurance Subsidiary that it is considering the downgrade of any rating assigned
to any  Insurance  Company  or  Insurance  Subsidiary.  As of the  date  of this
Agreement,  the Insurance Companies and the Insurance Subsidiaries have the A.M.

Reserves.  All statutory  reserves as  established or reflected in the Insurance
Statements  were  determined  in  accordance  with  SAP and  generally  accepted
actuarial  assumptions,  met  the  requirements  of the  insurance  laws of each

Assets.  Each Company and each of its  Subsidiaries  own or lease all buildings,
machinery,  equipment,  and other tangible  assets  necessary for the conduct of
their businesses as presently  conducted.  Except as set forth in Schedule 4.22,
each such tangible asset is free from material  defects (patent and, to Sellers'
or the Companies'  Knowledge,  latent),  has been  maintained in accordance with
normal industry practice,  is in good operating condition and repair (subject to
normal wear and tear),  and is suitable  for the purposes for which it presently
is used.

the Closing  Date or to any years and periods  prior  thereto and for which each
Company and each of its Subsidiaries  may be directly or contingently  liable in
its own right or as a transferee  of the assets of, or successor to, any Person.
No Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  has incurred any Tax  liabilities  other
than in the  ordinary  course of  business  for any  taxable  year for which the
statute of limitations has not expired. There are no tax liens (other than liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the  properties or assets of any
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth in Schedule 4.24(b),  Sellers, on a consolidated,  combined,
or other basis which  includes  each  Company and each of its  Subsidiaries,  as
appropriate,  has: (i) timely filed (taking in account all valid extensions), or

additional liability with respect thereto.
Sellers have  delivered to or made  available  for review by Buyer  complete and
correct  copies of Tax  Returns  of each  Company  and all  direct  or  indirect
Subsidiaries of such Company filed for the taxable years ended December 31, 1996
through the date of this Agreement, inclusive.
Except as set forth in Schedule  4.24(d),  no Seller or the  Companies or any of

respect of the  examination  of any Tax Return filed by, or with respect to, any
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  (including any consolidated or combined tax
returns or reports that include the Companies and Sellers).
Except as set forth in Schedule 4.24(e),  no Tax Return is presently  undergoing
an audit or examination by the IRS or any other taxing authority,  and no Seller
or any of the Companies is aware of any proposed or contemplated commencement of
any such audit or  examination;  there are no proceedings or actions pending for
the  assessment,  or collection of additional  Taxes;  and there are no material
outstanding deficiencies asserted by any taxing authority.
Sellers have  disclosed  the contents of, or made  available to Buyer copies of,
all  Internal   Revenue  Service  revenue  agent's  reports  and  other  written
assertions of deficiencies or other  liabilities for Taxes of any Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries  received  by  Sellers  or the  Companies  from any  taxing
authority  with  respect to past  periods  for which the  applicable  statute of
limitations has not expired.
Except as set forth in Schedule  4.24(g),  no Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has  received a Tax  Ruling or entered  into a Tax  Closing  Agreement  with any
taxing  authority  (foreign  or  domestic)  that would  affect  such  Company or

term "Tax Ruling" shall mean written rulings of a taxing  authority  relating to
Taxes,  and the term "Tax  Closing  Agreement"  shall mean a written and legally
binding agreement with a taxing authority relating to Taxes.

Each Company and each of its  Subsidiaries has complied with all applicable Laws
relating to the  withholding of Taxes and have timely  collected or withheld and
paid over to the proper taxing authority all amounts required to be so collected
or withheld for all periods up to (but not including)  the Closing Date.  Except
as set forth in Schedule  4.24(i),  no Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is or
will be required to make any material  adjustment  under  Section  481(a) of the
Code by reason of a change or proposed change in accounting method or otherwise.

Each  Company  and each of the  Subsidiaries  set forth in  Schedule  4.24(j) is
properly  treated as an "insurance  company" as defined for purposes of Sections
801 and 848 of the Code,  and has qualified for such  treatment for each taxable
year of its existence.  No Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  is or has been a
"United States Real Property Holding  Corporation" within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2)  of the  Code  during  the  applicable  period  specified  in  Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii)  of the  Code.  Except  as set forth in  Schedule  4.24(l),  no
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any joint venture,  partnership
or other  arrangement or contract which is treated as a partnership  for federal
income tax purposes.
None  of the  assets  of any  Company  or  any  of its  Subsidiaries  constitute

of Section  168 of the Code,  and none of the assets  reflected  on the  Closing
Balance Sheet is subject to a lease, safe harbor lease or other arrangement as a
result of which any  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  is not  treated as the
owner for federal income tax purposes.
Environmental  Matters.  Except as set forth in Schedule  4.25:  (a) neither the
business or operation of any Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  nor any of the
assets or, to  Sellers'  or the  Companies'  Knowledge,  Real  Property,  of any

effect as of the date hereof, and no condition or event has occurred which, with
notice or the passage of time or both,  would constitute a violation of any such
Law;  (b) no Seller or any  Company or any of their  Subsidiaries  has stored or
used any pollutants,  contaminants  or hazardous or toxic wastes,  substances or
materials on or at the Real Property,  except for inventories of chemicals which
are to be used in the ordinary course of business (which  inventories  have been
stored or used in accordance with all applicable  Environmental  Permits and all
Environmental Laws); (c) none of Sellers,  the Companies,  their Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates has received any notice from any Governmental
Authority or private entity  advising it that the Real Property or the operation
of  any  Company's  (or  its  Subsidiaries')  business  is in  violation  of any
Environmental Law or any applicable  Environmental Permit or that any of them is
responsible  (or  potentially  responsible)  for the cleanup of any  pollutants,
contaminants  or hazardous or toxic  wastes,  substances  or materials at, on or
beneath the Real Property;  (d) no Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their operations are the subject of federal,  state, local or private litigation
or proceedings  involving a demand for damages or other potential liability with
respect  to  violations  of  Environmental  Laws;  (e) no  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has buried, dumped,  disposed,  spilled or released any pollutants,
contaminants  or hazardous or toxic wastes,  substances or materials on, beneath
or about the Real Property or any property adjacent thereto; and (f) to Sellers'
or the Companies' Knowledge,  no pollutants,  contaminants or hazardous or toxic
wastes, substances or materials under any Environmental Law are currently stored
or  otherwise  located at the Real  Property.  Each Company and  Subsidiary  has
timely  filed all reports  required  to be filed by it with  respect to the Real
Property and the operation of such Company's (or Subsidiary's) business, and has
generated and maintained all required data,  documentation  and records required
of it, under any applicable Environmental Laws with respect thereto.  Employees.
To Sellers' and the Companies' Knowledge,  no executive,  Key Employee, or group
of employees  has any plans to terminate  employment  with any Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries.  No Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any collective  bargaining  agreement,  nor has any of them  experienced  any
strikes,  grievances,  claims of unfair  labor  practices,  or other  collective
bargaining  disputes.  No Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  has committed any
unfair  labor  practice.   To  Sellers  '  or  the  Companies'   Knowledge,   no
organizational  effort is presently  being made or threatened by or on behalf of
any  labor  union  with  respect  to  employees  of  any  Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries.
Employee Benefit Plans.
Except as set forth in Schedule  4.27(a),  no Company or any of its Subsidiaries
nor  any  of  their  respective  ERISA  Affiliates  maintains,  is a  party  to,
participates in, or has any liability,  or contingent liability with respect to:
any "employee welfare benefit plan" or "employee pension benefit plan" (as those
terms  are  defined  in  Sections  3(1) and 3(2) of  ERISA,  respectively);  any
retirement or deferred  compensation  plan,  incentive  compensation plan, stock
plan,  unemployment   compensation  plan,  vacation  plan,  vacation  pay  plan,
severance  pay,  bonus or  benefit  arrangement,  insurance  or  hospitalization
program  or any other  fringe  benefit  arrangements  for any  current or former
employee,   director,   consultant  or  agent,  whether  pursuant  to  contract,
arrangement,  custom or informal  understanding,  which does not  constitute  an
employee  benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA);  or any employment
agreement or consulting agreement.

Schedule 4.27(b) sets forth a true,  accurate and complete list of each employee
benefit  plan,  arrangement  or  agreement  of  each  Company  and  each  of its
Subsidiaries  (collectively,  the "Employee  Benefit Plans"),  and all Contracts
relating thereto, or to the funding thereof, including,  without limitation, all
trust agreements,  insurance  contracts,  administration  contracts,  investment
management   agreements,   subscription  and   participation   agreements,   and
recordkeeping  agreements,  each as in  effect  on the date  hereof,  have  been
provided to Buyer.  A true,  accurate  and  complete  copy of each such plan and
related  agreement  has been  provided  to  Buyer.  In the case of any  Employee
Benefit Plan which is not in written  form,  Buyer has been provided an accurate
description  of such  Employee  Benefit Plan as in effect on the date hereof.  A
copy of each IRS or DOL audit on any Employee Benefit Plan during the last three
(3)  years,  and a true and  correct  copy of the  most  recent  annual  report,
actuarial  report,  accountant's  opinion  of the plan's  financial  statements,
summary plan description and Internal Revenue Service  determination letter with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, to the extent  applicable,  and a current
schedule of assets (and the fair market value thereof  assuming  liquidation  of
any asset  which is not  readily  tradable)  held  with  respect  to any  funded
Employee  Benefit  Plan has been  provided  to  Buyer,  and  there  have been no
material  changes in the financial  condition in the respective  plans from that
stated in the annual reports and actuarial reports provided. Except as set forth
in Schedule  4.27(b),  with respect to each such IRS or DOL audit of an Employee
Benefit Plan, all audit issues have been fully resolved,  as of the date hereof,
to the satisfaction of the IRS or DOL, as applicable.
 As to all Employee Benefit Plans:
All  Employee  Benefit  Plans comply and have been  administered  in form and in
operation in all respects in accordance with their terms and with all applicable
requirements of Law (including,  in the case of any Employee  Benefit Plan which
is an employee  pension  benefit plan, the  requirements  of Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Code),  and no event has  occurred  which will or could  cause any
such  Employee  Benefit  Plan to fail to comply  with such  requirements  and no
notice has been issued by any Governmental  Authority questioning or challenging
such compliance.

Each  Employee  Benefit  Plan which is an employee  pension  benefit plan is the
subject of a favorable  determination  letter  issued by the IRS with respect to
the  qualified  status of such  plan  under  Section  401(a) of the Code and the
tax-exempt  status of any trust  which  forms a part of such plan under  Section
501(a)  of the Code;  all  amendments  to any such  plan for which the  remedial
amendment  period  (within  the  meaning  of  Section  401(b)  of the  Code  and
applicable regulations) has expired are covered by a favorable IRS determination
letter;   and  no  event  has  occurred   which  will  or  could  give  rise  to
disqualification  of any such plan under such sections or to a tax under Section
511 of the Code.

None of the  assets  of any  Employee  Benefit  Plan are  invested  in  employer
securities or employer real property.

There have been no  "prohibited  transactions"  (as  described in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan and
no Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any prohibited transaction.

There have been no acts or omissions  by any Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
nor any of their  respective  ERISA  Affiliates  which have given rise to or may
give rise to fines,  penalties,  taxes or related  charges  under Section 502 of
ERISA or  Chapters  43, 47 or 68 of the Code for which any Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may be liable.
There are no actions,  suits or claims (other than routine  claims for benefits)
pending or, to Sellers' or the Companies'  Knowledge,  threatened  involving any
Employee  Benefit Plan or the assets thereof and no facts exist which could give
rise to any such  actions,  suits or  claims  (other  than  routine  claims  for
benefits).
No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA and no Employee Benefit
Plan is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA).

Each Employee  Benefit Plan which  constitutes a "group health plan" (as defined
in Section 607(i) of ERISA or Section  4980B(g)(2)  of the Code),  including any
plans of current and former  affiliates  which must be taken into account  under
Sections  4980B and 414(t) of the Code or Sections  601-608 of ERISA,  have been
operated in compliance  with  applicable Law,  including  continuation  coverage
requirements  of  Section  4980B of the Code and  Section  601 of ERISA  and the
portability and nondiscrimination  requirements of Sections 9801 and 9802 of the
Code and  Sections  701-707  of  ERISA,  to the  extent  such  requirements  are
applicable.

Except as set forth in Schedule  4.27(c),  no Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability or  contingent  liability  for  providing,  under any Employee
Benefit  Plan  or  otherwise,  any  postretirement  medical  or  life  insurance
benefits,  other than  statutory  liability  for  providing  group  health  plan
continuation  coverage under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the
Code.

Actuarially  adequate  accruals for all obligations  under the Employee  Benefit
Plans are reflected in the financial statements of each Company (and each of its
Subsidiaries)   and  such   obligations   include  a  pro  rata  amount  of  the
contributions  which  would  otherwise  have been made in  accordance  with past
practices and applicable Laws for the plan years which include the Closing Date.
There has been no act or omission  that would  impair the ability of any Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or any successor  thereto) to unilaterally  amend or
terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.

Except as set forth in Schedule  4.27(d),  the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement  will not (i) entitle  any Company  Employee to
severance  pay; (ii)  accelerate  the time of payment or vesting of, or increase
the amount of, compensation due to any Company Employee;  or (iii) result in the
payment to any Company  Employee of an amount that will be an "excess  parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

Insurance Policies.  Schedule 4.28 sets forth a true, accurate and complete list
of all policies of fire,  liability,  life and employee  health,  environmental,
worker's compensation and other forms of insurance currently held and maintained
by each Company and each of its Subsidiaries, specifying the insurer, the amount
of  coverage  and the type of  insurance  under each such  policy.  None of such
policies  is in default.  Each of such  policies is in full force and effect and
all premium  payments are current or accruals  therefor  provided.  No notice of
cancellation or termination has been received by such Company or such Subsidiary
with  respect  to  any  such  policy.  Coverage  for  the  Companies  and  their
Subsidiaries  under all such  policies will not expire prior to the Closing Date
and will not terminate as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby. Such
policies are sufficient for compliance with all applicable  Laws.  Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.28, during the last five (5) years, no Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  (i) has been refused any  insurance  with respect to its assets or
operations, nor has any such coverage been restricted to less than the requested
scope or amount by the relevant  carrier,  or (ii) has filed any bonding  claims
against the issuers of the policies  set forth in Schedule  4.28. A copy of each
such policy has been delivered to Buyer.
Related Party  Transactions.  Except as set forth in Schedule 4.29, no director,
officer, Key Employee,  "affiliate" or "associate" (as such terms are defined in

indebtedness,  liabilities or other similar obligations to any Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries;  (ii) owns any direct or indirect interest of any kind in, or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

complete list of each  obligation  (as of the date hereof) of any Company or any
of  its  Subsidiaries  to  any  former  owner  of  any  Company  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries  or any of their  Affiliates.  Guarantees.  Except  as set forth in
Schedule 4.31, no Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a guarantor or otherwise
is liable for any liability or obligation (including  indebtedness) of any other
Person.

expenses  of  which  will be paid by  Sellers,  no  broker,  finder  or  similar
intermediary  has  acted  for or on  behalf of  Sellers,  the  Companies  or the
Subsidiaries,  or is entitled to any broker's,  finder's or similar fee or other

of the other Parties or (B) any of the contents hereof other than as required by
Law upon prior notice to the other Parties and other than with the prior consent
of each of the other Parties.

press release related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and  shall  consult  each  other as to the form and  substance  of other  public

required by Law.
Covenants  with  Respect to  Agreement.  During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date, except as required by applicable Law or with

the Closing set forth in Article  VIII not being  satisfied;  (iii)  result in a
violation of any provision of this Agreement;  or (iv) adversely affect or delay

Sellers  and  Buyer  shall  cooperate  with  each  other  and  use  commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,  to
effect  all  applications,  notices,  petitions  and  filings,  and to obtain as
promptly  as  practicable  all  permits,   consents,   approvals,   waivers  and
authorizations  of all third  parties  and  Governmental  Authorities  which are
necessary or advisable  to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement.  Sellers  and Buyer  shall have the right to review in  advance,  and
shall  consult  with the  other  on, in each case  subject  to  applicable  Laws
relating  to the  exchange  of  information,  all the  information  relating  to
Sellers,  the Companies and their Subsidiaries or Buyer, as the case may be, and
any of their  respective  Affiliates,  which appear in any filing made with,  or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide any Party with
a right to review any information  provided to any  Governmental  Authority on a
confidential basis in connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby. The
Parties  shall  consult  with each other with  respect to the  obtaining  of all
Permits,  consents,  approvals  and  authorizations  of all  third  parties  and
Governmental  Authorities  necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement  and each Party  shall  keep the other  Parties
apprised of the status of matters  relating to  completion  of the  transactions
contemplated herein. The Party responsible for a filing as set forth above shall
promptly   deliver  to  the  other  Parties   evidence  of  the  filing  of  all
applications,  filings, registrations and notifications relating thereto (except
for any confidential portions thereof), and any supplement, amendment or item of
additional  information  in connection  therewith  (except for any  confidential
portions  thereof).  The Party  responsible  for a filing  shall  also  promptly
deliver to the other Parties a copy of each material notice,  order, opinion and
other item of correspondence received by such filing Party from any Governmental
Authority  in  respect  of any such  application  (except  for any  confidential
portions  thereof).  In exercising  the foregoing  rights and  obligations,  the
Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as  practicable.  Without  limiting
the  generality of the  foregoing,  within  fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof,  Buyer shall make Form A filings with the insurance  departments of
the  States  of  Michigan,  New  Jersey,  Indiana,  Florida,  New York  and,  if
applicable,   California   and  Illinois   with  respect  to  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby.  Buyer shall  promptly  make any and all other filings and

contemplated hereby. Sellers shall furnish Buyer with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of such Form A filings and other filings or submissions. Buyer shall
keep  Sellers  fully  apprised  of its actions  with  respect to all filings and
submissions  and shall  provide  Sellers  with copies of such Form A filings and
other filings or  submissions.  Sellers and Buyer shall,  upon request,  furnish
each  other  with  all  information  concerning  themselves,  their  Affiliates,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary in connection with any statement,  filing,  notice or application made
by or on  behalf of  Buyer,  the  Companies,  the  Subsidiaries  or any of their
respective  Affiliates  to any  Governmental  Authority in  connection  with the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  (except to the extent  that such
information  would be, or relates to  information  that would be,  filed under a
claim of  confidentiality).  Sellers and Buyer shall promptly  advise each other
upon receiving any communication  from any Governmental  Authority whose consent
or approval is required for  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement  which  causes such Party to believe  that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any requisite  regulatory  approval will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

Further  Assurances.  Each of the Parties shall execute such documents and other
papers and perform such further acts, as  expeditiously  as possible,  as may be
reasonably  required  to carry out the  provisions  hereof and the  transactions
contemplated hereby. Each such Party shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, use
all  reasonable  efforts to fulfill or obtain the  fulfillment of the conditions
precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the execution and delivery of any documents, certificates,  instruments or other
papers that are reasonably  required for the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated hereby. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall
take such further  action  (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, all at the
sole cost and expense of the requesting  Party (unless the  requesting  Party is
entitled  to   indemnification   therefor  under  Article  IX  below).   Sellers
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing,  Buyer shall be entitled
to  possession  of  all  documents,  books,  records  (including  Tax  Records),
agreements,  and  financial  data of any sort  relating to each  Company and its
Subsidiaries.
Notification  of Certain  Matters.  Each Party shall give  prompt  notice to the
other  Parties  of (i) the  occurrence,  or  failure  to occur,  of any event or
existence of any  condition  that has caused or could  reasonably be expected to
cause any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material  respect at any time after the date of this
Agreement,  up to and including  the Closing  Date,  and (ii) any failure on its
part to comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant, condition
or  agreement  to be  complied  with or  satisfied  by it under this  Agreement.

reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken
as a whole;  cause all statutory reserves and other similar amounts with respect

contemplated  hereunder by the shareholders of Queensway Limited,  to the extent
required by the  fiduciary  obligations  of the Board of  Directors of Queensway
Limited,  as  determined  in good faith by such Board of Directors  based on the
advice of  independent  counsel,  Sellers may, (x) in response to an unsolicited
takeover  proposal and subject to compliance with the provisions set forth below
in this paragraph (vi),  furnish  information  with respect to the Companies and
their  Subsidiaries  to  any  Person  pursuant  to a  customary  confidentiality
agreement (as determined by Queensway Limited's independent counsel) and discuss
such  information  with  such  Person  and (y) upon  receipt  by  Sellers  of an
unsolicited takeover proposal and, subject to compliance with the provisions set
forth below in this paragraph (vi),  participate in negotiations  regarding such
takeover proposal.  For purposes of this paragraph (vi), an unsolicited takeover
proposal shall mean a proposal not solicited or initiated after the date of this
Agreement  by either  Seller,  any  Company or any  Subsidiary  or any  officer,
director or employee of, or any investment banker,  attorney or other advisor or
representative  of,  either  Seller,  any  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries.
Without  limiting the  foregoing,  it is  understood  that any  violation of the
restrictions  set forth in the  preceding  sentence by any  director,  executive
officer or employee of either Seller,  any Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any investment  banker,  attorney or other advisor or  representative  of either
Seller,  any Company or any of its  Subsidiaries,  whether or not such person is
purporting  to act  on  behalf  of  either  Seller,  any  Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this paragraph (vi)
by  Sellers.  For  purposes of this  Agreement,  "takeover  proposal"  means any
inquiry,  proposal  or offer from any person  relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a substantial  amount of the assets of any Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries,  other  than  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  or of 10% or more of the equity  securities of any Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries  or any tender offer or exchange  offer that, if  consummated,
would  result  in any  Person  beneficially  owning  10% or more of any class of
equity  securities  of any  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or any merger,
consolidation,   business   combination,   sale  of  substantially  all  assets,
recapitalization,  liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving any
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  other than the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement.  Sellers shall notify Buyer  immediately if any Person makes any
proposal,  offer,  inquiry, or contact with respect to any of the foregoing.  In
addition to the  obligations of Sellers set forth above in this paragraph  (vi),
Sellers  promptly  shall  advise  Buyer orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any takeover proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which
could lead to any takeover  proposal,  the material terms and conditions of such
request,  takeover proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Person making any
such  request,  takeover  proposal  or inquiry.  Sellers  shall keep Buyer fully
informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments)
of any such  request,  takeover  proposal  or inquiry.  withdraw  or modify,  or
propose to withdraw or modify,  in a manner  adverse to Buyer,  the  approval or
recommendation  by the Board of Directors of either Seller of this  Agreement or
the transactions  contemplated hereunder,  (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, any takeover proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement
with respect to any takeover proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  prior to
the approval of the transactions  contemplated  hereunder by the shareholders of
Queensway  Limited (if such approval is required by Law), the Board of Directors
of Queensway Limited,  to the extent required by its fiduciary  obligations,  as
determined  in good  faith by such  Board of  Directors  based on the  advice of
independent counsel, may (subject to the following sentences) withdraw or modify
its  approval  or   recommendation   of  this  Agreement  or  the   transactions
contemplated  hereunder,  approve or recommend any Superior Proposal (as defined
below),  enter into an  agreement  with  respect to such  Superior  Proposal  or
terminate this Agreement, in each case at any time after the second business day
following Buyer's receipt of written notice from Sellers advising Buyer that the
Board of  Directors  of  Queensway  Limited  has  received a Superior  Proposal,
specifying  the material  terms and  conditions  of such  superior  proposal and
identifying the Person making such Superior  Proposal (it being  understood that
any  amendment  to a superior  proposal  shall  necessitate  an  additional  two
business day period). In addition, if Sellers propose to enter into an agreement
with respect to any takeover  proposal,  they shall,  concurrently with entering
into such  agreement,  pay, or cause to be paid,  to Buyer the  Break-Up Fee (as
described in Section 14.18). For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
means any bona fide  takeover  proposal made by a third party on terms which the
Board of Directors of Queensway Limited  determines,  in its good faith judgment
(based on the advice of a financial  advisor of  recognized  reputation),  to be
more  favorable  to  Queensway  Limited's  shareholders  than  the  transactions
contemplated hereunder and for which financing,  to the extent required, is then
committed  or which,  in the good faith  judgment of such Board of  Directors of
Queensway Limited,  is reasonably capable of being financed by such third party.

and otherwise in accordance  with past practice;  take any action  impairing its

course of business) other than as may be determined by the Board of Directors of
any  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  to be in the best  interests  of such
Company;

license to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties is bound;

principles or methods, except as may be required by applicable Law or applicable
accounting standards or in the ordinary course of business;

respect to the proposed  purchase by North Pointe  Insurance  Company of renewal
rights and unearned  premiums  pursuant to that certain Letter of Intent,  dated
March  21,  2001,   between  North  Pointe   Insurance   Company  and  Queensway
International Indemnity Company (a copy of which has previously been provided by
Sellers  to Buyer)  or (ii) as a term of, or  requires  the  performance  of any
obligations  by any Company or Subsidiary  over a period in excess of, one year,
unless it is terminable by such Company or Subsidiary without penalty or premium
upon not more than thirty (30) days' notice;  provided,  however,  that if Buyer
fails to object to any such Contract  within five (5) Business Days of receiving
notice  thereof from such Company or  Subsidiary,  Buyer shall be deemed to have
consented to such Contract;

refrain from entering into any new treaty of reinsurance,  coinsurance, or other
similar  Contract,  whether as reinsurer or reinsured;  or agree (by contract or
otherwise) to do any of the foregoing.

Access;  Certain  Communication.  Between  the  date of this  Agreement  and the
Closing  Date,   subject  to  applicable   Laws  relating  to  the  exchange  of
information, Sellers shall (and shall cause the Companies and their Subsidiaries
to)  afford to Buyer and its  authorized  agents  and  representatives  complete
access,  upon  reasonable  notice  and  during  normal  business  hours,  to all
contracts,  documents and information of or relating to the assets, liabilities,
business,  operations,  personnel  and  other  aspects  of the  business  of the
Companies  and their  Subsidiaries.  Sellers  shall  cause  each  Company's  and
Subsidiary's  personnel  to provide  reasonable  assistance  to Buyer in Buyer's
investigation  of matters  relating to the  purchase  of the  Shares;  provided,
however,  that Buyer's  investigation  shall be conducted in a manner which does
not  unreasonably  interfere  with such  Company's or its  Subsidiaries'  normal
operations, customers, and employee relations. Without limiting any of the terms
thereof, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall govern Buyer's and its
agents'  and  representatives'  obligations  with  respect  to all  confidential
information  with  respect  to  each  Company  or  Subsidiary  provided  or made
available  to them at any time,  including  the period  between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date.

Maintenance of Records.  Through the Closing Date,  each Company and each of its
Subsidiaries  shall  maintain  the  Records in the same manner and with the same
care  that the  Records  have been  maintained  prior to the  execution  of this
Agreement. From and after the Closing Date, each of the Parties shall permit the
other Parties  reasonable  access to any  applicable  Records in its  possession
relating  to  matters  arising  on or before  the  Closing  Date and  reasonably
necessary in connection with any claim,  action,  litigation or other proceeding
involving the Party requesting  access to such Records or in connection with any
legal  obligation  owed by such Party to any  present or former  customer of any
Company or its Subsidiaries.
Transition.  From and after the Closing Date,  Sellers shall not take any action
that is  designed or  intended  to have the effect of  discouraging  any lessor,
licensor,  customer, supplier, or other business associate of any of any Company
or any of its Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with
such Company or Subsidiary  after the Closing as it maintained with such Company
or Subsidiary prior to the Closing.  Sellers shall refer all customer  inquiries
relating to the businesses of the Companies and its  Subsidiaries  to Buyer from
and after the Closing.
Confidentiality.  After the Closing Date, each Seller shall, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees,  accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and
agents to, treat and hold in confidence all of the Confidential Information, and
shall not  disclose  to any third  parties any of the  Confidential  Information
except in  connection  with this  Agreement.  In the event that either Seller is
requested or required (by oral question or request for  information or documents
in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or
similar  process) to disclose  any  Confidential  Information,  then such Seller
shall notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek
an appropriate  protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section  7.2(f).  If, in the absence of a  protective  order or the receipt of a
waiver  hereunder,  either  Seller is, on the advice of  counsel,  compelled  to
disclose any  Confidential  Information  to any  tribunal  (or other  applicable
Governmental  Authority) or else stand liable for contempt, then such Seller may
disclose the  Confidential  Information  to the  tribunal  (or other  applicable
Governmental  Authority);   provided,   however,  that  such  Seller  shall  use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of Buyer,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Confidential  Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall
designate.  The  foregoing  provisions  shall  not  apply  to  any  Confidential
Information which is generally  available to the public immediately prior to the
time of disclosure.  Resignation of Directors. Each Seller shall, or shall cause
each  Company  to,  deliver at Closing to Buyer the  resignation  of the current
directors of each Company and its  Subsidiaries  listed on Schedule  7.2(g) from
such offices.  Interim Financial Statements.  Sellers shall, or shall cause each
Company  to,  provide  to Buyer  as soon as  practicable  after  the end of each
calendar  month prior to the Closing  Date,  financial  statements  (prepared in
accordance with SAP) of each Company (and each of its Subsidiaries),  consisting
of a  balance  sheet as of the end of such  month and an  income  statement  and
statement  of cash  flows for that  month and for the  portion  of the year then
ended (the "Interim Financial Statements").
Special Purchase Price Adjustment.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
Agreement,  and in addition to Buyer's  rights under Article IX, in the event of
the  occurrence of any of the following (at any time or from time to time) prior
to the second anniversary of the Closing Date:
any portion of the net  receivable  owing from The Mauro Group (as  described in
Schedule  4.16) as of the Closing  Date not having been paid in full by the date
which is thirty (30) days prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date,

the net Loss Reserves for all Insurance Companies and Insurance  Subsidiaries as
of the Closing Date being inadequate for the losses and expenses  intended to be
covered thereby, as such losses and expenses have developed as of the date which
is thirty (30) days prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date,

any of the Insurance  Companies or Insurance  Subsidiaries  being  required,  by
contract or  otherwise,  to return any ceding or profit  commission  of any kind
(booked prior to the Closing  Date),  determined on a net  individual  Insurance
Company  or  Insurance  Subsidiary  basis  thirty  (30) days prior to the second
anniversary  of the  Closing  Date,  and only to the  extent  in  excess  of any
offsetting  liability for a ceding or profit commission booked as of the Closing
Date, or

any amounts paid to Paul L. Gross by any Company or any  Subsidiary  pursuant to
the obligations of Queensway Limited and Hermitage as set forth in Schedule 4.30
(regarding  Paul L. Gross' previous sale of Kodiak  Insurance  Company shares to
Hermitage),


then,  and in each  such  instance,  Buyer  shall  be  entitled  to make a claim
therefor upon the Escrow Agent and recover, on a dollar-for-dollar  basis (up to
the remaining  balance of the Holdback  Escrow Amount and not subject to Section
9.8), the full amount thereof. Any such amount satisfied out of the Escrow shall
be considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Claims.  The provisions of this Section shall be subject to Section 9.5. As soon
as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of a claim for indemnification
under this Agreement,  the party claiming  indemnification  from the other party
(the  "Indemnified  Person")  shall  promptly give notice to the party from whom
indemnification  is  requested  (the  "Indemnifying  Person")  (and,  if a Buyer
Indemnified Party is the Indemnified  Person and the Escrow continues to be held
by the  Escrow  Agent,  the  Escrow  Agent)  of such  claim and the  amount  the
Indemnified  Person will be entitled to receive  hereunder from the Indemnifying
Person; provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give notice shall
not relieve the  Indemnifying  Person of its obligations  under this Article IX,
except to the  extent  (if any) that the  Indemnifying  Person  shall  have been
prejudiced  thereby.  If the  Indemnifying  Person does not object in writing to
such indemnification  claim within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving notice
thereof,   the  Indemnified  Person  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  from  the
Indemnifying Person (and, if a Buyer Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Person
and the Escrow  continues  to be held by the  Escrow  Agent,  the Escrow  Agent)
within five (5) Business  Days after such thirty (30) day period,  the amount of
such  claim  (but such  recovery  shall not limit the  amount of any  additional
indemnification  to which the  Indemnified  Person may be  entitled  pursuant to
Section  9.2  or  9.3).  If  the  Indemnifying  Person  agrees  that  it  has an
indemnification  obligation,  but objects in writing that it is obligated to pay
only a lesser amount,  the Indemnified  Person shall nevertheless be entitled to
recover from the Indemnifying  Person (and, if a Buyer  Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified  Person and the Escrow continues to be held by the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent)  within five (5) Business  Days of the receipt of such  objection,
the lesser amount,  without prejudice to the Indemnified  Person's claim for the
difference.

Notice of Third Party Claims;  Assumption  of Defense.  The  Indemnified  Person
shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably  practicable to the  Indemnifying
Person (and,  if the  Indemnified  Person is a Buyer  Indemnified  Party and the
Escrow  continues  to be held by the  Escrow  Agent,  the  Escrow  Agent) of the
assertion of any claim, or the  commencement of any suit,  action or proceeding,
by any person not a party  hereto in  respect of which  indemnity  may be sought
under this  Agreement;  provided that the failure of the  Indemnified  Person to
give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying  Person of its obligations  under
this  Article  IX,  except to the extent (if any) that the  Indemnifying  Person
shall have been  prejudiced  thereby.  The  Indemnifying  Person may, at its own
expense  participate  in the defense of any claim,  suit,  action or proceeding,
provided that (i) the Indemnifying  Person's counsel is reasonably  satisfactory
to the Indemnified  Person,  and (ii) the  Indemnifying  Person shall thereafter
consult with the  Indemnified  Person upon the Indemnified  Person's  reasonable
request  for such  consultation  from time to time with  respect to such  claim,
suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the
Indemnified  Person shall have the right (but not the obligation) to participate
as counsel of record in the defense  thereof and to employ  counsel,  at its own
expense,  separate from the counsel  employed by the  Indemnifying  Person.  If,
however,  the  Indemnified  Person  reasonably  determines  in its judgment that
representation  by the  Indemnifying  Person's  counsel of both the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnified  Person would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest,  then such Indemnified Person may employ separate counsel to represent
or defend it in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and the Indemnifying
Person shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate counsel. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding,  all of the parties hereto shall  cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.
Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made
by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any
such claim,  suit,  action or  proceeding of the kind referred to in Section 9.5
shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as
the case may be, in the same  manner as if a final  judgment  or decree had been
entered by a co urt of competent  jurisdiction  in the amount of such settlement
or compromise; provided that no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed
on the  Indemnified  Person as a result  of such  settlement  without  its prior
written  consent.  The party  defending  the claim shall give the other party at
least thirty (30) calendar days' notice of any proposed settlement or compromise
of any claim, suit, action or proceeding it is defending,  during which time the
other party may reject such  proposed  settlement or  compromise;  provided that
from and after such rejection,  the other party shall be obligated to assume the
defense of and full and complete  liability and  responsibility  for such claim,
suit,  action or proceeding and shall be  responsible  for any and all Losses in
connection  therewith in excess of the amount of the proposed settlement amount.
Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act. In the event that the Indemnifying Person
does not elect to assume the defense of any claim,  suit,  action or proceeding,
then any failure of the  Indemnified  Person to defend or to  participate in the
defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be
done,  shall not relieve the Indemnifying  Person of its obligations  hereunder.
Minimum  Indemnification  Threshold.  No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification  from an  Indemnifying  Person under Sections 9.2 or 9.3 of this
Article IX unless the aggregate  amount of all claims by the Indemnified  Person
exceeds $150,000 (the "Minimum Indemnification  Threshold"),  in which case, the
Indemnified Person shall only have a right to assert claims pursuant to Sections
9.2 or 9.3 hereof in excess of the Minimum Indemnification Threshold. Escrow. In
the event a Buyer  Indemnified  Party is  entitled  to receive  any amount  from
Sellers under this Agreement, including any purchase price adjustment payment or
indemnification  payment under this  Agreement,  then, at the option of Sellers,
the amount claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Party may be satisfied by a transfer
to the Buyer  Indemnified Party by the Escrow Agent of a portion of the Purchase
Price  Adjustment  Escrow Amount or the Holdback Escrow Amount (as  applicable),
pursuant  to the Escrow  Agreement.  Pursuant to the Escrow  Agreement,  (a) the
remaining  balance of the Holdback Escrow Amount shall be released to Sellers on
the second  anniversary of the Closing Date,  except if and to the extent claims
have been  asserted by Buyer  against  Sellers,  in which case,  an  appropriate
portion of the Holdback  Escrow  Amount shall remain in Escrow until such claims
are  finally  resolved,  and (b) the  remaining  portion of the  Purchase  Price
Adjustment  Escrow Amount shall be released to Sellers within three (3) Business
Days following the Final Settlement Date.
Net Losses. Any indemnification  pursuant to this Article IX shall be net of (i)
any actual  federal or state income tax benefit,  specifically  arising from the
facts and circumstances  giving rise to the Loss,  realizable by the Indemnified
Person (or any of its  Affiliates)  by a reduction in Taxes  payable,  or by the
receipt of a refund of Taxes, by the  Indemnified  Person (or such Affiliate) so
that the Indemnified  Person, on an after-tax basis, shall be placed in the same
position as though the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Loss had never
occurred  or  existed,  and  (ii) any net  insurance  proceeds  received  by the
Indemnified Person (or its Affiliates) with respect to the Loss. The Indemnified
Person  shall  treat the Loss in a good faith  manner that causes any federal or
state income tax benefit to apply in the earliest year  reasonably  permissible.
Limits of Obligations of Sellers to Indemnify Buyer.  Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing  provisions of this Article IX,  Sellers shall not be required to make
payments  pursuant to this Article IX once the aggregate  amount of all payments
made by Sellers (pursuant to this Article IX and pursuant to Section 7.3) during
the  indemnification  periods  set  forth  above  exceeds  the  Purchase  Price.
Subrogation.  An Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the Indemnified Party
with  respect to all rights of the  Indemnified  Party under any claim for which
indemnification under this Article IX is provided.  Mitigation of Losses. In all
cases in which Losses are  incurred by an  Indemnified  Party,  such party shall
take such  reasonable  steps as are required to mitigate the scope and extent of
such Losses.
Tax  Indemnification.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Article
IX,  Buyer and Sellers  agree that the  provisions  of this Article IX shall not
apply to any covenant or agreement made under Article XI of this Agreement,  and
that Article XI of this Agreement  contains the exclusive  rights of the Parties
for  indemnification  relating to a Taxes and Tax  Returns,  including,  but not
limited to, any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.24
or  covenant  set forth in  Article  XI.  Adjustments  to  Purchase  Price.  All
indemnification payments under this Article IX shall be deemed to be adjustments
to the Purchase Price.

before the date which is one hundred  (100) days from the date hereof,  provided
that no Party shall be entitled to  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant to this
clause  (b) if such  Party's  failure  to  fulfill  any  obligation  under  this
Agreement  has been the cause of, or resulted  in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date;

by any Party if a court of  competent  jurisdiction  shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling permanently  restrain,  enjoining or otherwise  prohibiting the

Closing  Date,  for purposes of  allocating  liability  for Taxes there shall be
deemed a short  taxable  year ending on and  including  the  Closing  Date and a

Refunds.  Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes (including  interest
thereon)  actually received by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer which were paid by
Sellers, any Company or any of their Subsidiaries (other than those reflected as
assets on the Closing  Balance  Sheet) payable with respect to the operations of
any  Company  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  for  any  period  included  in the
Pre-Closing  Period,  other than  refunds  resulting  from a carryback  of a tax
attribute  of any  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  from a period  beginning
after the Pre-Closing  Period to a period  included in the  Pre-Closing  Period.

operations of any Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Refunds to which Sellers
are not entitled shall be retained by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer,  and shall
not be paid to Sellers, and if received by Sellers,  shall be paid over to Buyer
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt.
Filing of Tax Returns.  Buyer shall  prepare or cause to be prepared and file or

Buyer for Taxes paid in (i) and (ii) above  within  fifteen (15) days of payment
by Buyer or an  Affiliate  of Buyer to the  extent  such  Taxes are  subject  to
Sellers' obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 11.2.  Cooperation on
Tax Matters.
Sellers and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished  to the other,  upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books
and records) and assistance  relating to each Company and its Subsidiaries as is
reasonably  necessary for the filing of any Tax Return,  the preparation for any
Tax audit, the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding  relating
to any proposed Tax  adjustment  for which  Sellers or Buyer  retains  liability
under this Article XI.  Buyer and Sellers  shall keep all such  information  and
documents received by them confidential  unless otherwise required by Law. Buyer
and Sellers shall retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent
to each Company and its Su bsidiaries until the applicable period for assessment
of Taxes  under  applicable  law  (giving  effect to any and all  extensions  or
waivers)  has  expired,   and  such  additional  period  as  necessary  for  any
administrative or judicial proceedings relating to any proposed assessment,  and
to abide by and cause each Company and its  Subsidiaries  to abide by all record
retention  agreements entered into with any Taxing authority.  Sellers and Buyer
shall give the other  reasonable  notice prior to  transferring,  discarding  or
destroying  any such  books and  records  relating  to Tax  matters  and,  if so
requested, Sellers and Buyer shall allow the requesting party to take possession
of such books and records.

Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or
other  proceedings  for any Tax purposes and they shall each execute and deliver
such powers of attorney and other documents as are reasonably necessary to carry
out the intent of this Agreement.

Termination  of Tax Sharing  Agreements.  Any and all Tax sharing  agreements in
which any Company or any Subsidiary thereof is subject to shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date or amended to exclude the Company or such Subsidiary.

Tax Contests. In the case that a Tax claim is made against Buyer, any Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which would, if successful, result in an indemnification
of Buyer by Sellers under Section 11.2, the procedures set forth in Sections 9.4
through 9.7 shall apply.



EMPLOYMENT MATTERS
Employees and Employee Plans
General. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to impair or limit in
any  way the  right  of any  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or  Buyer  to
terminate the employment of any Company  Employee,  with or without cause, or to
modify, amend or to terminate any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or
policy  established,  maintained or  contributed to by any Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  or Buyer after the Closing;  nor,  except as set forth in Schedule
12.1,  shall it  require  any  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or Buyer to
provide any form or level of benefit to any Company  Employee after the Closing,
except as required to be provided by Law.
Welfare  Plans.  Effective  as of the  Closing  Date,  the  Companies  and their
Subsidiaries  shall cease to be participating  employers in the employee welfare
benefit plans maintained by Queensway  Limited ("Seller Welfare Benefit Plans").
Effective  as of the  Closing  Date,  Buyer  shall take such  action as it deems
necessary or  appropriate  to extend  coverage to Company  Employees who, on the
Closing Date, are actively employed by or on an approved leave of absence from a
Company  or  its  Subsidiaries   ("Continuing  Employees")  and  their  eligible
dependents  under one or more new or  existing  welfare  benefit  plans  ("Buyer
Welfare Benefit Plans") providing benefits that are substantially  comparable to
those provided under the Seller Welfare Benefit Plans  immediately  prior to the
Closing Date.  Neither Buyer nor the Buyer Welfare  Benefit Plans shall have any
liability or obligation  with respect to the Seller Welfare Benefit Plans or any
benefits thereunder.
Defined  Contribution  Plan .  Effective  as of the Closing  Date (or as soon as
practicable thereafter),  the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall cease to be
participating  employers  under  Queensway  Limited's  401(k)  plan that  covers
Company  Employees on the Closing Date (the "Seller 401(k) Plan").  Effective as
of the Closing  Date,  Buyer shall take such action as it deems  appropriate  to
extend  coverage under one or more new or existing  defined  contribution  plans
meeting the requirements of section 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan")
to Continuing  Employees who have account  balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan
on the Closing Date, and shall credit to Continuing  Employees under the Buyer's
401(k) Plan for purposes of eligibility and vesting the service credited to each
such Continuing Employee under the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date for
such purposes.  To the extent  permitted by applicable Law,  account balances of
Continuing  Employees  under the Seller  401(k)  Plan shall be  distributed  and
directly  rolled over to the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable  after the
Closing Date.  Buyer shall have no liability or  obligation  with respect to the
Seller 401(k) Plan or any benefits thereunder.
Further  Assurances.  Sellers and Buyer shall  cooperate to carry out the duties
and responsibilities  contained in this Article XII. In addition,  Sellers shall
make available to Buyer such information as Buyer may reasonably  request to the
determination  of carry out the  provisions  of this Article XII. No Third Party
Beneficiaries.  It is understood  and agreed  between Buyer and Sellers that all
provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or
employee  compensation  are  included  for the sole  benefit  of the  respective
Parties and do not and shall not create, except as specifically provided in this
Article XII, any right in any other person,  including,  but not limited to, any
employee, any participant in any benefit or compensation plan or any beneficiary
thereof.


NON-COMPETITION
Non-Competition.  In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Sellers
hereby  expressly  covenant and agree that,  for a period of five (5) years from
and after the Closing Date, no Seller or any of its Affiliates will, directly or
indirectly, (a) own, manage, operate, join, control, advise or participate in or
be connected  with any business,  individual,  partnership,  firm or corporation
which is at the time engaged, wholly or partly, within the United States, in any
of the businesses  engaged in by any Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  on the
Closing Date or (b) induce or attempt to persuade any current or future employee
of any Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  to  terminate  employment  with such
Company or the applicable  Subsidiary;  provided,  however, that (i) Sellers may
own an aggregate of not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding  stock of
any class of any corporation  engaged in any such  businesses,  if such stock is
listed  on  a  national   securities   exchange  or  regularly   traded  in  the
over-the-counter  market by a member of a national securities exchange,  without
violating the foregoing restriction, provided that such person does not have the
power to control or direct the management or affairs of such  corporation and is
not otherwise  associated with it, and (ii) such restrictive  covenant shall not
apply to any  Subsidiary of Queensway  Limited (other than the Companies and the
Subsidiaries to be acquired by Buyer  hereunder) which is acquired by any Person
which is not affiliated in any way with either Seller or any of its  Affiliates.
Remedies.  Sellers  expressly  covenant and agree that the remedy at Law for any
breach of this  Article  XIII will be  inadequate  and that,  in addition to any
other  remedies  Buyer  may have,  Buyer  shall be  entitled  to  temporary  and
permanent  injunctive  relief without the necessity of proving  actual  damages.
Severability.  To the extent that any part of this  Article XIII may be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable  for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be
enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such part if more  limited in scope  would have been  enforceable  and such
part shall be deemed to have been so written  and the  remaining  parts shall as
written be effective and enforceable in all events.
Acknowledgement. Sellers acknowledge that this covenant is not overly burdensome
and that Sellers have agreed to the  restrictions set forth in this covenant for
the purpose of inducing  Buyer to enter into this  Agreement,  and that Buyer is
relying on such  restrictions  and would not have entered into this Agreement if
Sellers had not agreed to the restrictions set forth in this Article XIII.



MISCELLANEOUS
Amendments.  This  Agreement may not be amended,  altered or modified  except by
written instrument  executed by each Party.  Costs.  Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers,  on the other hand, shall each pay its own costs and expenses  incurred
by it in  negotiating  and preparing  this Agreement and in closing and carrying
out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  whether or not the Closing
shall occur. Sellers shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges and fees, if any,
imposed  by the United  States or any state or  political  subdivision  thereof,
required  to be paid in  connection  with the  transfer  and  assignment  of the

assets of any Company or any  Subsidiary  for any  expenses  incurred by them in
connection with this  transaction  (including,  without  limitation,  the taxes,

attorneys',   consultants'  or  similar  fees  and  expenses).   Interpretation;
Headings.  When a reference is made in this  Agreement to Sections,  Exhibits or
Schedules,  such  reference  shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or  Schedule to
this Agreement  unless otherwise  indicated.  The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation  of this Agreement.  Whenever the words
"include,"  "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,  they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without  limitation."  The phrases "the date
of this  Agreement,"  "the date hereof" and terms of similar import,  unless the
context  otherwise  requires,  shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in
the first  paragraph of this  Agreement.  Severability.  Except as otherwise set
forth in Section 13.3, any term or provision of this Agreement  which is invalid
or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to  that  jurisdiction,  be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rending
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting  the validity or  enforceability  of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.  If any provision of this Agreement is
so broad as to be  unenforceable,  the provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is  enforceable.  Notices.  All  notices  and  other  communications
hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed  given if (a)  delivered  in

                                            intended or shall be construed to

                                            Without the prior written consent of
                                            the Parties, this Agreement may not
                                            be assigned by any of the Parties;
                                            provided, that, without any such
                                            consent, Buyer may assign any of its

                                            Buyer.

Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,  each
of which  shall be deemed an  original,  but all of which taken  together  shall
constitute  one and the  same  agreement,  it being  understood  that all of the
Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
No Prejudice. This Agreement has been jointly prepared by the Parties hereto and
the terms  hereof  shall not be  construed  in favor of or against  any Party on
account of its participation in such preparation. Governing Law. This Agreement,
the legal relations between the Parties and the adjudication and the enforcement
thereof,  shall be governed by and  interpreted and construed in accordance with
the laws of the  State  of  Illinois,  applicable  to  contracts  made and to be
performed entirely within said state.
Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other
Parties would be irreparably  damaged in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific  terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that they each shall
be  entitled  to an  injunction  or  injunctions  to  prevent  breaches  of  the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically this Agreement and the
terms and provisions  hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United
States or any  state  thereof  having  competent  personal  and  subject  matter
jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which any of the Parties may be
entitled, at law or in equity.
Waivers.  The failure of a Party at any time or times to require  performance of
any  provision  hereof  shall in no manner  affect  its right at a later time to
enforce the same.  No waiver by a Party of any condition or of any breach of any
term, covenant,  representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be
effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or more instances shall be
deemed to be a further or continuing  waiver of any such  condition or breach in
other  instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty.
Entire  Understanding.  This  Agreement  sets  forth the  entire  agreement  and
understanding of the Parties in respect to the transactions  contemplated hereby
and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to
the subject  matter  hereof and is not  intended to confer upon any other person
any  rights  or  remedies  hereunder.  There  have  been no  representations  or
statements,  oral or  written,  that  have been  relied on by any Party  hereto,
except  those  expressly  set  forth in this  Agreement.  Disclosure  Schedules.
Nothing in a  Disclosure  Schedules  shall be deemed  adequate  to  disclose  an
exception to a  representation  or warranty made herein,  unless such Disclosure
Schedule  identifies the exception with particularity and describes the relevant
facts in detail.  Without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  the mere
listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall not be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a  representation  or warranty  made herein
(unless the  representation  or  warranty  has to do with the  existence  of the
document or other item itself).
Knowledge.  When  used  in  this  Agreement,  the  phrase  "to  Sellers'  or the
Companies'  Knowledge" and similar words and phrases means the knowledge,  after
reasonable  inquiry,  of the  individuals  listed on Schedule  14.14.  Interest.
Except as otherwise  specifically  provided herein, all sums payable pursuant to
this  Agreement  that are not paid when due shall bear  interest  at the rate of
nine percent (9%) per annum, which interest shall accrue from the date such sums
are due until paid.
Arbitration. In the event of any dispute between the Parties with respect to any
matter set forth herein, either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other
hand,  may demand  that the dispute be  submitted  to binding  arbitration.  The
demand for  arbitration  by any party (the  "Demanding  Party")  shall (i) be in
writing,  (ii) be served on the other party (the  "Non-Demanding  Party") in the
manner  prescribed in Section 14.5 for giving  notices,  and (iii) set forth the
matter or matters to be arbitrated and the name of the arbitrator  chosen by the
Demanding Party. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of such demand,
the Non-Demanding Party shall choose an arbitrator and provide written notice of
such selection to the Demanding  Party and shall specify the name and address of
such arbitrator.  If the Non-Demanding  Party shall fail to choose an arbitrator
and  notify the  Demanding  Party as herein  provided  within  such  fifteen-day
period,  the  Demanding  Party  shall  have the  right to apply to the  American
Arbitration  Association  (the  "AAA")  located  in  Chicago,  Illinois,  for an
appointment of an arbitrator.  The two  arbitrators so chosen as set forth above
shall  promptly  appoint a third  arbitrator as soon as  practicable,  provided,
however,  if they do not do so within  twenty (20) Business Days after notice is
given to the parties of the appointment of the second  arbitrator,  either Party
may  apply  to the  AAA  for  the  appointment  of  the  third  arbitrator.  Any
arbitration   pursuant  hereto  shall  be  in  accordance  with  the  Commercial
Arbitration  Rules of the AAA as then in effect,  except to the extent that such
rules are in conflict  with the  provisions  of this  Section  14.16;  provided,
however,  if the AAA is not  then  functioning  or such  rules  are not  then in
effect,  arbitration  proceedings  shall be  conducted  in  accordance  with the
requirements of the Uniform  Arbitration Act. All such  arbitration  proceedings
shall take place in Chicago,  Illinois.  The  arbitrators  shall meet as soon as
practicable  after  the  third  arbitrator  is  appointed.  Both  the  foregoing
agreement  of the  parties to  arbitrate  any and all claims,  and the  results,
determination,   finding,  judgment  and/or  award  rendered  pursuant  to  such
arbitration,  shall  be final  and  binding  on the  parties  hereto  and may be
specifically enforced by legal proceedings in any court having jurisdiction over
such action.
Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby guarantees the performance of the obligations of
Buyer to Sellers hereunder.

Break Up Fee.
General.  If (i) this  Agreement is terminated by either Seller prior to Closing
for any  reason  other  than a  material  breach  by  Buyer  of its  obligations
hereunder,  and (ii) within nine (9) months after the date of such  termination,
either  Seller  commits  to  or  consummates  a  transaction   relating  to  the
acquisition  of ten percent (10%) or more of the capital stock of any Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries,  or any material  portion of the assets or business of
any of them,  in whole or in part,  whether  through  direct  purchase,  merger,
consolidation,  sale of assets or other business combination,  then, immediately
upon such  consummation,  each of the Sellers agree that Queensway Limited shall
pay to  Buyer a fee  (the  "Break-Up  Fee"),  by Wire  Transfer  in  immediately
available  funds, in the applicable  amount set forth in paragraph (b) below. If
Buyer is paid the  Break-Up  Fee,  it shall have no other  remedies at Law or in
equity with respect to the  termination of this  Agreement.  Buyer  acknowledges
that payment of any Break-Up Fee shall be subordinate to the right of the Senior
Lenders to be repaid principal and interest on their loans to Sellers.

Amount of Break-Up  Fee.  The amount of the  Break-Up  Fee  payable  pursuant to
paragraph  (a) above  shall be  determined  in  accordance  with the  applicable
provisions set forth below:

General Premises for Termination.  In the event the termination by either Seller
of this Agreement is premised upon any reason other than (A) a condition failure
as described in paragraph (b)(ii) below or (B) a material breach by Buyer of its
obligations hereunder, the Break-Up Fee shall be equal to $2,400,000.

Non-Satisfaction of Closing  Conditions.  In the event the termination by either
Seller of this  Agreement  is  premised  upon the failure to occur of any of the
conditions  set forth in Article VIII or Sections  10.1(b),  10.1(c) or 10.1(d),
the  Break-Up  Fee shall be equal to the sum of (A) the costs  incurred by or on
behalf of Buyer in connection with pursuing the matters  contemplated  hereunder
and the  transaction  contemplated  hereby  and (B) U.S.  $300,000;  provided  ,
however, that if the above-described condition failure is attributable, in whole
or in part,  to Sellers  not  acting in good  faith (and not using  commercially
reasonable  efforts) to facilitate the  satisfaction  of such  condition  (where
Sellers have some control or influence over the satisfaction of such condition),
the  Break-Up  Fee shall be equal to the  amount set forth in  paragraph  (b)(i)
above.

Argonaut Insurance Company,  Queensway,  North Pointe Financial  Services,  Inc.
("North Pointe"), Hermitage Insurance Company ("Hermitage"),  and Universal Fire

R E C I T A L S
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Argonaut will, simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, purchase from Queensway all of the capital stock of
North  Pointe,  Hermitage  and  Universal and all of the capital stock of Queens
Pointe Financial  Services Company which is not owned by North Pointe.  Pursuant
to the Stock  Purchase  Agreement,  Argonaut and Queensway  have agreed that the
Holdback Escrow Amount and the Purchase Price Adjustment  Escrow Amount shall be
deposited into escrow (the "Escrow"), subject to the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, and released and disbursed as provided herein.

A G R E E M E N T
     In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants of the parties hereto
and for other good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, it is hereby agreed as follows:

         Establishment of Escrow.

Argonaut and Queensway hereby appoint Escrow Agent to serve as the escrow agent
under, and to administer the terms of, this Agreement.

Argonaut  has caused to be deposited  with Escrow  Agent into an escrow  account
which is hereby  established  (the "Escrow  Account") the Holdback Escrow Amount
and the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, which shall be held by Escrow Agent in
trust for the  benefit of Argonaut  and  Queensway,  and shall be  released  and
disbursed by Escrow Agent only in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement.
Escrow Agent agrees to accept the Holdback  Escrow Amount and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount and to issue its receipt upon delivery of the funds.

Release of Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount. Upon receipt by Escrow Agent
of a certificate  signed by an  authorized  officer of each of Buyer (if at all)
and Queensway Inc.,  stating how the Purchase Price Adjustment  Escrow Amount is
to be  released  to each of Buyer and  Queensway  Inc.  (on behalf of itself and
Queensway  Limited),  Escrow Agent shall,  within three (3) Business  Days after
receipt of such  certificate,  release and disburse  all of the  Purchase  Price
Adjustment  Escrow  Amount  (plus  investment  income  thereon,  as described in
Section 23) in accordance with such certificate. If Buyer and Queensway Inc. are
unable  to  agree  upon the  release  and  disbursement  of the  Purchase  Price
Adjustment  Escrow  Amount,  then Escrow Agent shall  release and disburse  such
funds  only  upon  receipt  of the  letter  (and  only in  accordance  with  the
instructions  contained in such letter) from the Independent Accounting Firm, as
set forth in Section  3.4(c) of the Stock Purchase  Agreement.  Such release and
disbursement  by Escrow Agent shall be made with three (3) Business  Days of the
receipt by Escrow Agent of such letter.

Release of Holdback Escrow Amount.  Escrow Agent agrees to disburse the Holdback
Escrow Amount as follows:
Claim Amount. Upon receipt by Escrow Agent of a certificate signed by an officer
of Argonaut (a "Claim Notice"),  stating that Losses exist or are asserted,  and
specifying in reasonable  detail the  individual  items of such Losses,  and the
nature of the  misrepresentation,  breach of  warranty or covenant to which such
item is related,  Escrow Agent shall,  subject to the provisions of this Section
3,  deliver to Argonaut  out of the Escrow,  as  promptly as  practicable,  upon
liquidating  permitted Escrow  investments as set forth in Section 23, a portion
of the  Holdback  Escrow  Amount  equal to the full  amount of such  Losses (the
"Claim  Amount").  Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  any claim by Argonaut
against the Escrow made in a Claim  Notice  pursuant to this  Section 3 shall be
referred to herein as a "Claim" or, if multiple,  "Claims."  Any delivery of the
Claim Amount by Escrow Agent out of the Holdback  Escrow Amount shall be subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 3(b) below.
Release of Claim  Amounts.  Within  twenty (20)  calendar days of receipt of the
Claim Notice from  Argonaut,  Queensway  Inc., on behalf of itself and Queensway
Limited,  shall either (i) direct  Escrow Agent in writing to disburse the Claim
Amount to Argonaut,  or (ii) notify Argonaut,  with contemporaneous  delivery to
Escrow  Agent,  in writing of an intention to dispute the Claim and the basis of
such dispute.  If Queensway  Inc.  fails to make any of the foregoing  elections
within such twenty (20) day period,  Argonaut  shall send written notice of such
failure to Escrow  Agent,  who shall  disburse the Claim Amount to Argonaut,  as
promptly as practicable  (upon liquidating  permitted Escrow  investments as set
forth in Section 23), following the receipt of such written notice. If Queensway
Limited  elects to dispute the Claim,  Argonaut and Queensway Inc. shall attempt
in good faith until thirty (30)  calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice
to agree upon the rights of the  respective  parties with respect to each Claim.
If Argonaut and Queensway Inc. should so agree, a memorandum  setting forth such
agreement  shall be prepared and signed by Queensway Inc. and Argonaut and shall
be delivered to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum  and shall  distribute  the Claim Amount,  as promptly as practicable
(upon liquidating permitted Escrow investments as set forth in Section 23), from
the Escrow in accordance with the terms thereof.  If Argonaut and Queensway Inc.
are unable to agree,  then,  subject to Sections 3(c) and 3(d) below, such Claim
Amount shall not be disbursed  from the Escrow  Account until such dispute shall
be  resolved  in  accordance  with the  terms of the Stock  Purchase  Agreement.
Promptly  after such  resolution,  Argonaut and Queensway  Inc.  shall execute a
memorandum  which sets forth such  resolution  and deliver  such  memorandum  to
Escrow Agent.  Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
shall distribute the Claim Amount in accordance with the terms thereof.
Release of Escrow.  Subject to this Section 3(c), on the second  anniversary  of
the Closing Date,  Escrow Agent shall release to Queensway Inc. (in its capacity
as a party to this Agreement and as an agent for Queensway  Limited) the balance
in the Escrow (the "Escrow  Balance"),  consisting of the Holdback Escrow Amount
and the Purchase Price  Adjustment  Escrow Amount  deposited on the date hereof,
plus the amount of investment  proceeds described in Section 23, less the amount
of the Purchase Price Adjustment  Escrow Amount disbursed  pursuant to Section 2
and the  portion  of the  Holdback  Escrow  Amount  that shall have been used to
satisfy  Claims.  In the event that there are any Claims  specified in any Claim
Notice  previously  delivered to Escrow Agent which are unresolved on the second
anniversary  of the Closing  Date,  then,  subject to the objection of Queensway
Inc. as provided  herein,  Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow  Account that
portion of the Escrow Balance which, in the reasonable judgment of Argonaut,  is
necessary  to satisfy any such  unsatisfied  Claims  until such Claims have been
fully and finally resolved (the "Retained  Amount").  If Queensway Inc. disputes
the retention of all or a portion of the Retained Amount, Argonaut and Queensway
Inc.  shall  attempt in good faith within  thirty (30)  calendar  days after the
second  anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Retention  Resolution  Period") to
agree upon the amount of the Retained  Amount.  If Argonaut and  Queensway  Inc.
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by Queensway  Inc.  and Argonaut and shall be delivered to Escrow  Agent.
Escrow  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to rely on any  such  memorandum  and  shall
distribute  and/or  retain such  Retained  Amount in  accordance  with the terms
thereof.  If  Argonaut  and  Queensway  Limited  are unable to agree  within the
Retention  Resolution  Period,  the Retained Amount (if any) shall be determined
pursuant to Section 3(d) below.
Arbitration.  If Argonaut  and  Queensway  Inc.  are unable to agree  within the
Retention Resolution Period, the Retained Amount (if any) shall be determined by
arbitration  as set forth in Section 19 below.  The  arbitrators  shall  deliver
their  decision in writing,  which shall include a  calculation  of the Retained
Amount  (if  any),  to  Escrow  Agent  contemporaneously  with the  delivery  to
Queensway  Inc.  and  Argonaut.  Escrow  Agent  shall be entitled to rely on the
decision of such  arbitrators and shall  distribute  and/or retain in the Escrow
Account such Retained Amount in accordance with the decision of the arbitrators.
Argonaut (on the one hand) and Queensway  Inc. (on the other hand) shall each be
responsible  for one  half of all  fees  and  costs  of the  arbitrators.  Joint
Release.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall promptly release and
disburse all or any portion of the Escrow Balance as directed in any certificate
which may be jointly  executed by  authorized  officers of  Queensway  Inc.  and
Argonaut.  Termination of Escrow.  This Escrow  Agreement and the Escrow Account
created  hereby  shall  terminate  upon  delivery  of all of the Escrow  Balance
pursuant to the terms of Section 3 above.
Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses.  Escrow Agent's fees for serving as Escrow Agent
hereunder shall be as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto.  If for any reason
Escrow  Agent  resigns,  then Escrow  Agent shall  refund a pro rata part of the
annual fee  described  in Exhibit A based on the number of days in the year that
Escrow Agent has served as such.  Argonaut (on the one hand) and Queensway  Inc.
(on the other  hand)  shall each be  responsible  for  one-half of all of Escrow
Agent's fees. Further,  Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed equally by Argonaut (on
one hand) and  Queensway  Inc. (on the other hand) for all  reasonable  expenses
described in Exhibit A which are incurred by Escrow Agent in the  performance of
its duties hereunder.
Scope of Undertaking.  Escrow Agent's duties and  responsibilities in connection
with this Agreement  shall be purely  ministerial  and shall be limited to those
expressly  set  forth  in  this  Agreement.  Escrow  Agent  is not a  principal,
participant  or  beneficiary in any  transaction  underlying  this Agreement and
shall have no duty to inquire  beyond the terms and  provisions  hereof.  Escrow
Agent shall have no  responsibility or obligation of any kind in connection with
this  Agreement  and shall not be required to deliver the  property  held in the
Escrow  Account  or any part  thereof  or take any  action  with  respect to any
matters that might arise in connection therewith, other than to hold, invest and
deliver the  property as herein  provided.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any error in judgment,  any act or omission,  any mistake of law or fact, or for
anything it may do or refrain  from doing in  connection  herewith,  except for,
subject to Section 7 below, its own wilful misconduct or gross negligence. It is
the intention of the parties hereto that Escrow Agent shall never be required to
use, advance or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights and powers
hereunder.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  Escrow Agent shall
have no  obligation  to file or prepare  any tax returns or to prepare any other
reports  for any  taxing  authorities  concerning  the  matters  covered by this
Agreement.
Reliance;  Liability.  Escrow  Agent may rely on,  and  shall not be liable  for
acting or  refraining  from acting  upon,  any written  notice,  instruction  or
request or other paper furnished to it hereunder or pursuant hereto and believed
by it to be  genuine  and what it  purports  to be and to have  been  signed  or
presented by the proper party or parties.  Escrow Agent shall be responsible for
holding,  investing  and  disbursing  the  property  held in the Escrow  Account
pursuant to this  Agreement;  provided  that in no event shall  Escrow  Agent be
liable  for any  lost  profits,  lost  savings,  or  other  special,  exemplary,
consequential  or incidental  damages in excess of Escrow Agent's fee hereunder,
except to the  extent  such  losses or  damages  are  attributable  to the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of Escrow Agent;  and,  provided  further,  that
Escrow  Agent shall have no  liability  for any loss or damage  arising from any
cause beyond its control,  including, but not limited to, the following: acts of
God, force majeure, including,  without limitation, war (whether or not declared
or existing),  revolution,  insurrection, riot, civil commotion, accident, fire,
explosion, stoppage of labor, strikes and other differences with employees;

the act,  failure or neglect of any other party or any agent or correspondent or
any other person reasonably selected by Escrow Agent; any delay, error, omission
or  default  of any  mail,  courier,  telegraph,  cable or  wireless  agency  or
operator;  or the acts or edicts of any  government  or  governmental  agency or
other group or entity exercising governmental powers.

In addition,  Escrow Agent is not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever
for the sufficiency,  correctness, genuineness or validity of the subject matter
of this  Agreement  or any part hereof or for the  transaction  or  transactions
requiring or underlying the execution of this  Agreement,  the form or execution
hereof or for the identity or authority of any person  executing  this Agreement
or any part hereof.

Right of Interpleader. Should any controversy arise involving the parties hereto
or any of  them or any  other  person,  firm  or  entity  with  respect  to this
Agreement, or should a substitute escrow agent fail to be designated as provided
below, or if Escrow Agent should be subject to conflicting  demands of different
parties  hereto,  Escrow  Agent  shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,
either  to (a)  withhold  delivery  of the  property  until the  controversy  is
resolved,  the conflicting demands are withdrawn,  or its doubt is resolved,  or
(b) institute a petition for interpleader in any court of competent jurisdiction
to  determine  the  rights  of  the  parties  hereto.   Should  a  petition  for
interpleader be instituted, or should Escrow Agent be threatened with litigation
or become  involved in  litigation in any manner  whatsoever in connection  with
this  Agreement,  then,  as between the other parties on the one hand and Escrow
Agent on the other,  Argonaut and Queensway  Inc.  hereby  jointly and severally
agree to reimburse  Escrow Agent for its reasonable  attorneys' fees and any and
all other expenses, losses, costs and damages of Escrow Agent in connection with
or resulting from such threatened or actual litigation prior to any disbursement
hereunder.

Indemnification.  Argonaut and Queensway Inc. hereby jointly and severally agree
to indemnify Escrow Agent, its officers,  directors,  employees and agents (each
herein called an "Indemnified  Party") against,  and hold each Indemnified Party
harmless  from,  any and all  expenses,  losses,  costs and damages,  including,
without limitation,  attorneys' fees, and claims, including, but not limited to,
costs  of  investigation,  litigation,  arbitration,  tax  liability  or loss on
investments, suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with or
arising  from or out of this  Agreement,  except such acts or  omissions  as may
result from the wilful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Party.
Resignation  and  Removal.  Escrow Agent may resign  hereunder  upon thirty (30)
calendar  days'  prior  written  notice to the other  parties  hereto.  Upon the
effective  date of such  resignation,  Escrow  Agent  shall  deliver  the Escrow
Balance  to any  substitute  escrow  agent  designated  by the other  parties in
writing. If the other parties fail to designate a substitute escrow agent within
thirty (30)  calendar  days after the giving of such  notice,  Escrow  Agent may
institute a petition  for  interpleader  or petition  any court in Cook  County,
Illinois  to  appoint  a   substitute   Escrow   Agent.   Escrow   Agent's  sole
responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold
such Escrow  Balance and to deliver the same to a designated  substitute  escrow
agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order or judgment
of a court of competent  jurisdiction,  at which time of delivery Escrow Agent's
obligations  hereunder  shall cease and terminate.  The other parties may remove
and replace  Escrow Agent by a writing signed by Argonaut and Queensway Inc. and
delivered to Escrow Agent,  and Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Balance to
any designated  replacement escrow agent selected by Argonaut and Queensway Inc.
