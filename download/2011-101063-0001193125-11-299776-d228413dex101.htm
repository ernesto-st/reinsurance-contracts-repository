The Borrower may, on any Business Day prior to the Maturity Date, increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments and/or borrow one or more additional term loans (the <I>&#147;Incremental Term Loans&#148;</I>) by delivering an
Increase Request substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;S or in such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent at least five&nbsp;(5) Business Days prior to the desired effective date of such increase or the making of such
term loan(s) (the <I>&#147;Increase&#148;</I>) identifying an additional Lender(s), which additional Lender(s) shall, to the extent such consent would be required under Section&nbsp;8.05, in the case of an additional Lender providing a Revolving
Loan Commitment, be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or additional Revolving Loan Commitments or Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, for existing Lender(s)) and the amount of its Revolving Loan Commitment (or additional amount
of its Revolving Loan Commitment(s)) or Incremental Term Loan Commitment (or additional amount of its Incremental Term Loan Commitment(s)), as applicable; <I>provided, however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;any such Increase must first be offered to existing
Lenders on the terms available to the Borrower under any financial proposal or otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Borrower in an amount equal to such Lender&#146;s Percentage of the aggregate amount of such Increase prior to being offered to any
additional Lender (<I>provided</I> that the failure of any Lender to respond to any request for an Increase within 5 Business Days following its receipt thereof shall be deemed a refusal by such Lender), (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of all such
Increases shall not exceed $50,000,000, (iii)&nbsp;any such Increase shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000, (iv)&nbsp;no Default or Event of Default shall exist at the time of the effective date of the Increase, (v)&nbsp;the Borrower shall
be in compliance on a pro forma basis with all covenants set forth in Sections&nbsp;5.02(a) and 5.02(b) and in pro forma compliance with the Financial Covenants, and (vi)&nbsp;all representations and warranties contained in Section&nbsp;4 hereof
shall be true and correct in all material respects (unless any such representation or warranty is qualified as to materiality, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on the effective date of such
Increase. The effective date (the <I>&#147;Increase Date&#148;</I>) of the Increase shall be agreed upon by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lender(s) providing such Increase. With respect to an Increase in the Revolving Loan
Commitments as described above, on the Increase Date, the new Lender(s) (or, if applicable, existing Lender(s)) shall advance Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient such that after giving effect to such advance(s) or loan(s) and the prepayment of
Loans by any Lender(s) whose commitment is not increased, each Lender shall have outstanding its Revolving Proportionate Share of Revolving Loans. It shall be a condition to such effectiveness that if any LIBOR Loans are outstanding under the
Revolving Loan Facility on the date of such effectiveness, such LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be prepaid on such date (to the extent necessary to allocate such outstanding LIBOR Loans in accordance with the Revolving Proportionate Share of each
Lender after giving effect to the related Increase) and the Borrower shall pay any amounts owing to the Lenders pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.13 hereof. The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent relating
to any Increase. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment or make Incremental Term Loans and no Lender&#146;s Revolving Loan Commitment shall be increased without
its consent thereto, and each Lender may at its option, unconditionally and without cause, decline to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment or make Incremental Term Loans. </FONT></P>

Administrative Agent or such Lender shall give the Borrower notice of the matter and the Administrative Agent or such Lender may select its own counsel or request that the Borrower defend such suit, claim or demand, with legal counsel satisfactory

judgment, claim or demand is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or creditors, any Indemnitee or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the Transaction is
