Counsel or such other officer as the Committee shall from time to time designate no later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the date of any such withholding requirement. Any shares of Dexia Stock
sold to the Company pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8 shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of the applicable withholding requirement (or if such day is not a trading day for Dexia

decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan (including without limitation any interpretation of this Agreement and the
Plan) shall be final and binding, in the absence of bad faith or manifest error, on all persons and otherwise entitled to the maximum deference permitted by law, including the Company and you. Any
dispute, controversy or claim between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration conducted in the City of New York, in accordance with the
