the knowledge of Borrowers,  threatened against Borrowers,  at law, in equity or
otherwise, before any court, board, commission, agency or instrumentality of any
federal,  state, or local government or of any agency or subdivision thereof, or
before any  arbitrator  or panel of  arbitrators,  which  challenges  Borrowers'
right,  power, or competence to enter into this Consent and Amendment or, to the
extent  applicable,  perform  any of their  obligations  under this  Consent and
Amendment,  the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document,  or the validity or
enforceability of this Consent and Amendment,  the Credit Agreement or any other
Loan  Document or an action taken under this Consent and  Amendment,  the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document or except for items on Disclosure  Schedule
(3.13)  or  notifications  sent to  Agent  since  the  Closing  Date,  which  if
determined  adversely,  is  reasonably  likely to have or  result in a  Material
Adverse  Effect after giving  effect to this Consent and  Amendment.  Except for
items on Disclosure  Schedule  (3.13) or  notifications  sent to Agent since the
Closing Date,  to the  knowledge of  Borrowers,  there does not exist a state of
facts which is reasonably likely to give rise to such proceedings.

contained in the Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be true and
correct on and as of the Consent  Effective Date (as  hereinafter  defined) with
the same effect as if such  representations  and warranties had been made on and
as of such  date,  except  that any such  representation  or  warranty  which is
expressly made only as of a specified dated need be true only as of such date.

        5.   No Other  Consents/Waivers. Except as  expressly  provided  herein,
             --------------------------
(i) the Credit  Agreement  shall be unmodified  and shall continue to be in full
force  and  effect in  accordance  with its  terms  and (ii)  this  Consent  and
Amendment  shall  not be deemed a waiver  of any term or  condition  of any Loan
Document  and shall not be deemed  to  prejudice  any right or rights  which the
Agent  or any  Lender  may  now  have  or may  have in the  future  under  or in
connection  with any  Loan  Document  or any of the  instruments  or  agreements
referred to  therein,  as the same may be amended  from time to time.  Except as
otherwise provided for herein,  nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to be a
consent by Agent or Lenders  with  respect to any sale or other  disposition  by
Borrowers of any assets.

of or in connection with the Credit Agreement (collectively,  "Claims"), whether
based in contract, tort, implied or express warranty, strict liability, criminal

any Borrower or any other Credit Party ever had, now has or might hereafter have
against Agent or Lenders which relates,  directly or indirectly,  to any acts or
omissions of Agent,  Lenders or any other Indemnified  Person on or prior to the
Consent Effective Date (as hereinafter defined),  provided, that no Borrower nor
any other Credit Party waives any Claim solely to the extent such Claim  relates
to the Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

        7.   Expenses.  Borrowers  hereby  reconfirm their obligations  pursuant
             --------
to Sections 1.9 and 11.3 of the Credit  Agreement to pay and reimburse Agent and
the  Lenders  for  all  reasonable  costs  and  expenses   (including,   without

(hereinafter called "Director").

                                    RECITALS:

A.   AGWAY has established a deferred payment program for Directors.

B.   Director desires to participate in the program upon the following terms and
     conditions.

                                   WITNESSETH:

         For good and  valuable  consideration,  the  parties,  intending  to be
legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

         1.    Director hereby designates (check one)

                         % of retainer (or $        of retainer) only
               ---  ---                    -------
                         % of per diem and all other payments other than expense
               ---  ---
               reimbursements (or $         of  per  diem and all other payments
                                   --------
               other than expense reimbursements) only
                         % of both  retainer and per diem and all other payments
               ---  ---
               other than expense reimbursements (or $          of both retainer
                                                      ---------
               and per diem)

                                       -1-

<PAGE>



for the  period  beginning  January  1, 2002 and  ending  December  31,  2002 be
credited to Director's Reserve Account.

         2. AGWAY shall  maintain in its accounting  records a separate  account
(herein called "Director's Reserve Account") for each Director electing deferral
of any amount under this  Agreement and shall credit to the  Director's  Reserve
Account  the item or items  designated  by  Director  in  Section  1 above.  The
Director's  Reserve Account shall also be credited at the close of each calendar
quarter with an amount computed by applying the average cost-of-debt  percentage
as hereinafter defined to the total average accumulated credit of the Director's
Reserve Account. "Average cost-of-debt" as used in this Agreement shall mean the
average cost to AGWAY of the debt employed by AGWAY during each calendar quarter
in the conduct of AGWAY's  business,  and this  average  cost-of-  debt shall be
determined by the Treasurer of AGWAY.

         3. AGWAY and Director  hereby  agree that  payment from the  Director's
Reserve Account shall begin on the first January 1 or July 1 that follows the 15
month  anniversary  of the Director's  attainment of age fifty-five  (55) or the
date on which Director's  service as Director of AGWAY terminates,  whichever is
earlier.

This Agreement by the Director shall be irrevocable;  provided, however, that at
least  twelve (12)  months  prior to January 1 or July 1  described  above,  the
Director may request,  by notice in writing to Agway,  that the  commencement of
payments be deferred to a specified  January 1 or July 1 date later than that on
which commencement was previously  scheduled.  Whether to approve such a request
shall be within the  discretion  of the Chief  Financial  Officer  of AGWAY,  or
his/her  designee.  Approval  of  such a  request  shall  be in  writing.  After
approval,  Director shall have no right to payment at any date earlier than that
specified in the written  approval.  In any event,  payments  shall commence not
later than the January  following the calendar  year when  Director  reaches age
seventy (70).

                                       -2-

<PAGE>



AGWAY may impose a thirty (30) day waiting  period  before the first  payment is
made.

         4. Payment will be either (a) a lump sum payment of the entire  balance
in the Director's Reserve Account; or (b) in an amount determined by multiplying
the balance in the Director's  Reserve Account at the beginning of each calendar
year during which a payment is to be made by a fraction,  the numerator of which
is one (1) and the  denominator  of which will be the number of years  remaining
during  which the  Director's  Reserve  Account  will be paid to  Director.  The
payment  election  must  be  made at  least  twelve  (12)  months  prior  to the
commencement of payment in writing to the chief  financial  officer of AGWAY, or
his/her designee, to have the payments made:
                          (A) over 3 years;
                          (B) over 5 years;
                          (C) over 10 years;
                          (D) over 15 years; or
                          (E) over 20 years.

If a timely  election  is not made,  the entire  balance in  Director's  Reserve
Account will be paid in a single lump sum.

If the  initial  annual  payment  computed  for the  applicable  payment  period
described  above  would  be less  than ten  thousand  dollars  ($10,000),  then,
notwithstanding the prior provisions of this Section, AGWAY may make payment (at
the  sole  discretion  of  AGWAY)  either  in one  (1)  lump  sum  or in  annual
installments  over the longest period  resulting in an initial annual payment of
at least ten thousand dollars ($10,000).

         5.    Upon furnishing AGWAY with proper evidence of financial hardship,
Director  may  request  a  withdrawal  of  all  or  part  of  the balance in the


                                       -3-

<PAGE>



Director's  Reserve  Account.  Whether to approve such a request shall be within
the discretion of the Chief  Financial  Officer of AGWAY,  or his/her  designee.
Approval of such a request shall be in writing.

         6. In the  event of  Director's  death,  either  before  or  after  the
payments to Director have begun,  the amount  payable,  as provided in Section 4
above, shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries  designated by Director
in the most recent  notice in writing to AGWAY in  installments  computed in the
same  manner  as if  Director  was  still  living.  If no  beneficiary  has been
designated, the amount payable, as provided in Section 4 above, shall be paid in
installments  computed  in the same manner as if  Director  was still  living to
Director's  estate or, at the sole discretion of AGWAY, the remaining balance in
the Director's  Reserve Account may be paid in a lump sum to Director's  estate.
In the event that after  payments have  commenced to the  beneficiary  or to the
beneficiaries   designated  by  Director  the  sole   beneficiary  dies  or  all
beneficiaries die, then, any remaining balance in the Director's Reserve Account
will  be  paid  in a  lump  sum  to  the  sole  beneficiary's  estate  or to the
beneficiaries'  estates.  In the absence of clear  written  instructions  to the
contrary, a designation of multiple  beneficiaries will be deemed to provide for
payment to the designated  beneficiaries in equal shares, and for the payment to
Director's estate of the share of any beneficiary who predeceases  Director.  In
the event of Director's  death before the payments to Director  have begun,  the
payments  will  commence on the January 1 or July 1, next  following the date of
Director's death.

         7.       Director agrees that AGWAY's liability to make any payment as
provided in this Agreement shall be contingent upon Director's:

              (a)     being available to AGWAY for consultation and advice after
termination of service  as  a  director of AGWAY, unless Director is disabled or
deceased; and

                                       -4-

<PAGE>



              (b)     retaining  unencumbered any interest or benefit under this
Agreement.

                  If  Director  fails  to  fulfill  any  one or  more  of  these
contingencies,  AGWAY's  obligation  under this  Agreement  may be terminated by
AGWAY as to Director.

         8.  Director  also agrees that  AGWAY's  obligations  to make  deferred
payments  under this  Agreement  are merely  contractual;  and that AGWAY is the
outright  beneficial  owner of,  and does not hold for  Director  as  trustee or
otherwise,  the amounts credited to Director's  Reserve  Account;  and that such
amounts are subject to the rights of AGWAY's creditors in the same manner and to
the same extent as all assets owned by AGWAY.

         9. Neither Director nor Director's beneficiary/ies shall have the right
to encumber,  commute, borrow against, dispose of or assign the right to receive
payments under this Agreement.

         IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  AGWAY  and  Director  have  duly  executed  this
Agreement the day and year first above written.

                                      AGWAY INC.

                                    RECITALS:

     A.   AGWAY has established a deferred payment program for Directors.

     B.   Director  desires to  participate  in the program  upon the  following
          terms and conditions.

                                   WITNESSETH:

         For good and  valuable  consideration,  the  parties,  intending  to be
legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

         1. Director hereby  designates     % (or $         ) of annual retainer

quarter in the conduct of AGWAY's business, and this average cost-of- debt shall
be determined by the Treasurer of AGWAY.

         3. AGWAY and Director  hereby  agree that  payment from the  Director's
Reserve Account shall begin on the first January 1 or July 1 that follows the 15
month  anniversary  of the Director's  attainment of age fifty-five  (55) or the

This Agreement by the Director shall be irrevocable;  provided, however, that at
least  twelve (12)  months  prior to January 1 or July 1  described  above,  the
Director may request,  by notice in writing to Agway,  that the  commencement of
payments be deferred to a specified  January 1 or July 1 date later than that on

Account will be paid in a single lump sum.

payments to Director have begun,  the amount  payable,  as provided in Section 4
above, shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries  designated by Director

the sole beneficiary dies or all beneficiaries  die, then, any remaining balance
in the  Director's  Reserve  Account  will  be paid  in a lump  sum to the  sole
beneficiary's  estate or to the beneficiaries'  estates. In the absence of clear
written  instructions to the contrary,  a designation of multiple  beneficiaries
will be deemed to provide for payment to the designated  beneficiaries  in equal
shares, and for the payment to Director's estate of the share of any beneficiary
who predeceases  Director.  In the event of Director's death before the payments
to Director  have begun,  the payments will commence on the January 1 or July 1,

4. Payout  Provisions

         (a) If EBITDA and  Leverage Targets are met at different levels for the
         purpose of annual  incentive calculation,  the payout is the sum of the
         two individual   payouts.  Example: If annual results for EBITDA equals
         Target at  $34.428M  (30%  Payout) and annual  leverage  result  equals
         maximum   payout level of 3.2 to 1 (60% Payout),  the total payout will
         be 90% of Base Salary.

         (b) All payouts will be in cash and shall be made in a lump  sum within
         90 days after the end of the term of the respective incentive plan.

         (c) EBITDA will be calculated after the accrual of the  expense for the
         incentive.

         (d) EBITDA financial  covenants under  Agway  Inc.'s  principal  credit
         agreements  in  effect  at the  time  of  each reporting period must be
         exceeded in order  for a  payout to be made  under the EBITDA incentive
         calculation contained in this agreement.


5. Conditions

          (a) If the employee voluntarily  terminates employment for good reason
          (as hereinafter defined) or if Agway terminates his employment without
          cause (as  hereinafter  defined)  during the plan  period,  he will be
          eligible for a payout under both plans.  The payout will be calculated
          on a pro-rated  basis  (using  completed  weeks of service  during the
          incentive  period)  representative  of the employee's period of active
          full time employment during the term of each such plan.

          (b) If the employee dies, retires (as hereinafter defined), or becomes
          permanently  disabled  to  such a  degree  that he is  prevented  from
          performing  the usual duties of his position,  he (or his estate) will
          be  eligible  for a  payout  under  both  plans.  The  payout  will be
          calculated  on a pro-rated  basis  (using  completed  weeks of service
          during the incentive  period)  representative of the employee's period
          of active full time employment during the term of each such plan.

          (c) If there is a change of control (as defined in the Indemnification
          Agreement between Agway Inc. and the employee) during the plan period,
          the  employee  will be  deemed  fully  vested in both the  annual  and
          long-term incentive plans. Fully vested means the payout will be fully
          earned without a reduction.

                                        2
<PAGE>


          (d) The payout for three  events,  5(a),  (b), and (c) above,  will be
          calculated based upon target  performance.  Upon the occurrence of one
          of these three  events (a),  (b) or (c) the  employee  (or his estate)
          will also receive a payout  equal to 200% of his base  salary.  Payout
          for these three events,  5(a),  (b), and (c) above and payment of base
          salary shall be made in a lump sum within 90 days after the occurrence
          of the event.

          (e) If the employee  voluntarily quits without good reason or if Agway
          terminates  his  employment for cause during an unexpired plan period,
          he will not be eligible for any part of any payout,  payments or other
          compensation  identified  in this  document  for the  applicable  plan
          period.

          (f)  Incentives  earned  under  this plan are taken into  account  for
          purposes  of Agway's  employee  benefit  plan  programs  to the extent
          provided by the terms of those programs in effect at the time payments
          are made.

          (g) Under any of the events  described in 5(a), (b) or (c) above,  (i)
          the  employee  will be deemed on leave status in order to receive full
          employee benefits at active employee  contribution rates for one year,
          and  (ii)  the  employee  will  receive  for one  year  following  his
          termination executive level career transition assistance services by a
          firm selected by the employee and paid for by Agway.

In these incentive plans, "you" and "your" refer to and mean the employee.

For  purposes  of these  incentive  plans,  "cause"  means  termination  of your
employment  by  Agway  acting  in good  faith  due to  your  (i)  willful  gross
misconduct or gross negligence with respect to your responsibilities,  including

in any material  respect any written  policy of Agway or of your duty of loyalty
owed to  Agway,  or  acting  in any way that is  materially  detrimental  to the
business  reputation  of Agway,  (ii)  conviction  of, or a plea of guilty or no
contest to, a felony or crime of moral turpitude,  or (iii) willful repeated use

businesses, (iii) any diminution in your compensation or benefits other than (a)
a diminution in your  compensation  that is  implemented  in connection  with an
across  the board  reduction  of  executive  salaries  of the  Company  or (b) a
modification  or elimination of any benefit plan that affects other employees of
Agway or other senior  executives of Agway generally,  (iv) the requirement that
you relocate  outside of the Syracuse,  NY area, or (v) the requirement that you

3. Consideration will be given for additional incentives as a result of one-time
events that financially benefit Agway and occur during the term of the plans.

4. Payout Provisions

     (a)      All payouts will be in cash and paid from Energy earnings. Payouts
              shall be made in a lump sum within 90 days  after the  end of  the
              term of the respective incentive plan.

     (b)      EBITDA will be calculated after the accrual of the expense for the
              incentive.

     (c)      EBITDA  financial  covenants  for  Agway Energy under Agway Inc.'s
              principal  credit  agreements  in  effect  at  the  time  of  each
              reporting period, both quarterly and annually, must be exceeded in
              order for a payout to be made under the annua incentive
              calculations contained in this agreement.

5.  Conditions

          (as hereinafter defined) or if Agway terminates his employment without
          cause (as  hereinafter  defined)  during the plan  period,  he will be
          eligible for a payout under both plans.  The payout will be calculated
          on a pro-rated  basis  (using  completed  weeks of service  during the
          incentive  period)  representative  of the employee's period of active
          full time employment during the term of each such plan.

          (b) If the employee dies, retires (as hereinafter defined), or becomes
          permanently  disabled  to  such a  degree  that he is  prevented  from
          performing  the usual duties of his position,  he (or his estate) will
          be  eligible  for a  payout  under  both  plans.  The  payout  will be

          of active full time employment during the term of each such plan.

          (c) If there is a change of control (as defined in the Indemnification
          Agreement between Agway Inc. and the employee) during the plan period,
          the  employee  will be  deemed  fully  vested in both the  annual  and
          long-term incentive plans. Fully vested means the payout will be fully
          earned without a reduction.

          (d) The payout for three  events,  5(a),  (b), and (c) above,  will be
          calculated based upon target  performance.  Upon the occurrence of one
          of these three  events (a),  (b) or (c) the  employee  (or his estate)
          will also receive a payout  equal to 100% of his base  salary.  Payout

          provided by the terms of those programs in effect at the time payments
          are made.

          (g) Under any of the events  described in 5(a), (b) or (c) above,  (i)
          the  employee  will be deemed on leave status in order to receive full
          employee benefits at active employee  contribution rates for one year,
          and  (ii)  the  employee  will  receive  for one  year  following  his

Dear Mike,

This letter  confirms  our  understanding  of your newest  responsibilities  and
compensation.

Effective today, your  responsibilities will include all areas of operations for
our Agriculture and Energy  businesses.  Your title is Executive Vice President,
Agriculture  & Energy and you will retain the title of  President,  Agway Energy
Products LLC. Your base compensation is $400,000 per year.

Your  fiscal  2002  incentive  arrangement  related  to Agway  Energy  Products'
performance for both short-term  incentive and long-term incentive payments will
remain in place.  In  addition,  for fiscal  2002 there will be two  payments of
$150,000  each.  The first will be for  successfully  completing  the  necessary
components of the Agriculture Plan that need to be submitted to our banks in our
3rd Quarter. The second payment will be made at year-end,  with 4th Quarter plan
execution underway.

We discussed the component of your arrangement related to potential  termination
and agreed that we need to confirm that the  language in your current  agreement
transfers  to your new  position  satisfactorily.  I have asked Jerry  Seeber to
review this.

Finally,  we agreed  that in  developing  your goals for fiscal  2003 for Energy
performance,  Feed performance,  Agronomy  performance/value  attained,  we will
target your total compensation at $1 million for that year.

Mike,  please see me if you have any  questions.  You know how pleased I am that
you are advancing  these important  business  initiatives on behalf of Agway. My
hope and belief is that I will continue to see you succeed and prosper.

Sincerely,

     comprise that group,  including  full  accountability  for results and full
     authority  for  decision  making.  You will be expected  to meet  oversight
     responsibilities of the Corporate Center,  including  financial  reporting,
     leadership development, legal matters and communications.

2.   You will report directly to me.

3.   Your initial annual base salary will be $350,000, and will be subject to an
     annual  review and  adjustment  beginning in August 2002.  Your base salary
     amount in effect from time to time during your employment shall hereinafter
     be referred to as your "base  salary." Your base salary shall be payable in
     accordance with Agway's usual payroll payment  practices.  Your base salary
     is not subject to a decrease.

4.   You will be  eligible  for an  annual  bonus  payment  based  upon  meeting
     performance  objectives which will be established prior to the beginning of
     each fiscal year of Agway.  Your  performance  objectives will be driven by
     financial goals such as earnings,  cash flow and growth. You will receive a
     cash payout of 50% of your base salary upon  completion of a strategic plan
     for Produce and  Sunflower.  You will be eligible for an additional  50% if
     earnings targets,  which we will establish prior to the beginning of fiscal
     year 2002,  are met.  These  targets will be  developed on a sliding  scale
     basis. Upon the payout of the additional 50%, we will provide an additional
     pro-rated payout for the months of May and June 2001.

     For fiscal year 2003 and thereafter,  your annual bonus will be targeted at
     50% of your base salary;  additional  or lesser  amounts above or below the
     50% may be paid depending on results.

     Your annual  bonus will be payable in a single lump sum cash payment at the
     same time as other executives' annual bonuses are paid, except as otherwise
     provided in this letter agreement.

5.   A long term incentive plan driven by earnings and/or value creation will be
     in place at the  beginning of Fiscal Year 2002,  for a single lump sum cash
     payout at the end of Fiscal Year 2004. Your target will be 75% of your base
     salary.  Additional  or lesser  amounts  above or below the 75% may be paid
     depending on results. The benefits under this long term incentive plan will
     accrue  annually,  at a rate of one third per year.  A new three (3) Fiscal

     apartment  rental expense or other housing  expense in Illinois;  and after
     you cease paying a mortgage,  apartment  rental or other housing expense in

                               INDEMNITY AGREEMENT
                               -------------------

     This Indemnity Agreement  ("Agreement") is made as of April 30, 2001 by and
between AGWAY, INC., a Delaware  corporation (the "Company"),  and Roy Lubetkin,
1470 Littlefield Court, Lake Forest, IL 60045 ("Indemnitee").

                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS,  highly  competent  persons  have become more  reluctant  to serve
publicly-held  corporations as directors or in other capacities  unless they are
provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate  indemnification
against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their
service to and activities on behalf of the corporation.

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined
that,  in order to attract and retain  qualified  individuals,  the Company will
attempt  to  maintain  on an  ongoing  basis,  at its  sole  expense,  liability
insurance  to protect  persons  serving the Company  and its  subsidiaries  from
certain  liabilities.  Although  the  furnishing  of such  insurance  has been a
customary and widespread  practice among United  States-based  corporations  and
other business  enterprises,  the Company  believes  that,  given current market
conditions and trends,  such insurance may be available to it in the future only
at  higher  premiums  and with more  exclusions.  At the same  time,  directors,
officers,  and other persons in service to corporations or business  enterprises
are being  increasingly  subjected to expensive  and  time-consuming  litigation
relating to, among other  things,  matters  that  traditionally  would have been
brought only against the Company or business  enterprise  itself. The By-laws of
the  Company  require  indemnification  of the  officers  and  directors  of the
Company.  Indemnitee  may also be  entitled to  indemnification  pursuant to the
Delaware  General  Corporation Law ("DGCL").  The By-laws and the DGCL expressly
provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive,
and thereby  contemplate  that contracts may be entered into between the Company
and members of the board of  directors,  officers and other persons with respect
to indemnification.

     WHEREAS,   the   uncertainties   relating   to   such   insurance   and  to
indemnification  have  increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such
persons.

     WHEREAS,  the  Board  has  determined  that  the  increased  difficulty  in
attracting  and retaining  such persons is  detrimental to the best interests of
the  Company's  stockholders  and that the  Company  should  act to assure  such
persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future.

     WHEREAS,   it  is  reasonable,   prudent  and  necessary  for  the  Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf
of, such persons to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable law so that they
will serve or continue to serve the Company  free from undue  concern  that they
will not be so indemnified.


                                       -1-

     WHEREAS,  this  Agreement  is a  supplement  to and in  furtherance  of the
By-laws of the Company and any resolutions  adopted pursuant thereto,  and shall
not be deemed a substitute  therefor,  nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of
Indemnitee thereunder.

     WHEREAS,  Indemnitee  does not regard the  protection  available  under the
Company's  By-laws and insurance as adequate in the present  circumstances,  and
may  not be  willing  to  serve  as an  officer  or  director  without  adequate
protection,  and the  Company  desires  Indemnitee  to serve  in such  capacity.
Indemnitee  is willing  to serve,  continue  to serve and to take on  additional
service  for  or on  behalf  of  the  Company  on the  condition  that  he be so
indemnified.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  premises  and  the  covenants
contained  herein,  the Company and  Indemnitee do hereby  covenant and agree as
follows:

     1.   SERVICES TO THE COMPANY. Indemnitee  will  serve or continue to serve,
at the  will  of  the  Company,  as an officer,  director or key employee of the
Company  for so long as  Indemnitee  is  duly  elected  or  appointed  or  until
Indemnitee tenders his or her resignation.

     2.   DEFINITIONS.   As used in this Agreement:

Securities;

            (ii) Change in Board of Directors.  During  any  period  of  two (2)
consecutive  years (not  including  any period  prior to the  execution  of this
Agreement),  individuals  who at the  beginning  of such period  constitute  the
Board,  and any new  director  whose  election  by the Board or  nomination  for
election  by the  Company's  stockholders  was  approved  by a vote of at  least
two-thirds  of the directors  then still in office who either were  directors at
the  beginning of the period or whose  election or  nomination  for election was
previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a least a majority of
the members of the Board;

            (iii) Corporate Transactions.  The  effective  date  of  a merger or
consolidation  of the  Company  with any other  entity,  other  than a merger or
consolidation  which  would  result  in the  Voting  Securities  of the  Company

represent  (either by remaining  outstanding  or by being  converted into voting
securities of the  surviving  entity) more than 51% of the total voting power of
the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
merger or  consolidation  and with the power to elect at least a majority of the
board of directors or other governing body of such surviving entity;

     3.   INDEMNITY IN THIRD-PARTY PROCEEDINGS. The  Company  shall   indemnify,
defend and hold harmless  Indemnitee in accordance  with the  provisions of this
Section 3 if  Indemnitee  was, is, or is  threatened to be made, a party to or a
participant  (as a  witness  or  otherwise)  in  any  Proceeding,  other  than a
Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor.
Pursuant  to this  Section  3,  Indemnitee  shall  be  indemnified  against  all
Expenses,  judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest,  assessments  and other charges paid or payable in connection with
or in respect of such Expenses,  judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement)  actually and reasonably  incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in
connection  with such  Proceeding  or any  claim,  issue or matter  therein,  if
Indemnitee  acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably  believed to be in
or not  opposed  to the best  interests  of the  Company  and,  in the case of a
criminal  Proceeding  had no  reasonable  cause to believe  that his conduct was
unlawful.

     4.   INDEMNITY IN PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY.        The
Company shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Indemnitee in accordance with
the  provisions of this Section 4 if Indemnitee  was, is, or is threatened to be
made, a party to or a participant  (as a witness or otherwise) in any Proceeding
by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment  in its favor.  Pursuant
to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually
and  reasonably  incurred  by him or on  his  behalf  in  connection  with  such
Proceeding or any claim,  issue or matter therein,  if Indemnitee  acted in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Company.  No  indemnification  for Expenses shall be made under
this Section 4 in respect of any claim,  issue or matter as to which  Indemnitee
shall have been finally adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company , unless
and only to the extent that any court in which the Proceeding was brought or the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine upon  application  that,  despite the
adjudication  of  liability  but in view of all the  circumstances  of the case,
Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification.

     5.   INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF A PARTY WHO IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY
SUCCESSFUL.  Notwithstanding  any other  provisions  of this  Agreement,  to the
extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on
the merits or otherwise,  in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter  therein,  in whole or in part,  the  Company  shall  indemnify  and hold
harmless Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him
in  connection  therewith.  If  Indemnitee  is not  wholly  successful  in  such
Proceeding but is successful,  on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but
less than all claims,  issues or matters in such  Proceeding,  the Company shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each successfully
resolved claim,  issue or matter.  If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in
such  Proceeding,  the Company also shall  indemnify,  defend and hold  harmless
Indemnitee against all Expenses  reasonably incurred in connection with a claim,
issue or matter related to any claim, issue, or matter on which the Indemnitee


                                       -5-

<PAGE>



was  successful.  For  purposes  of this  Section and  without  limitation,  the
termination  of any claim,  issue or matter in such a Proceeding  by  dismissal,
with or without prejudice,  shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such
claim, issue or matter.

     6.   INDEMNIFICATION  FOR  EXPENSES  OF A  WITNESS.   Notwithstanding   any
other provision of this  Agreement,  to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason
of his Corporate  Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not
a party,  he shall be  indemnified,  defended  and  held  harmless  against  all
Expenses actually and reasonably  incurred by him or on his behalf in connection
therewith.

     7.   ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)   Notwithstanding  any   limitation  in   Sections 3, 4, or 5,  the
Company shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Indemnitee if Indemnitee is a
party  to or  threatened  to be  made a party  to any  Proceeding  (including  a
Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor)
against all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including  all  interest,  assessments  and other  charges  paid or  payable in
connection with or in respect of such Expenses,  judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement)  actually and  reasonably  incurred by Indemnitee in
connection  with the  Proceeding.  No indemnity shall be made under this Section
7(a)  on  account  of  Indemnitee's   conduct  which  constitutes  a  breach  of
Indemnitee's  duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders or is an act or
omission not in good faith or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of the law.

         (b) Notwithstanding any  limitation  in  Sections 3, 4, 5 or 7(a),  the
Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indemnitee if Indemnitee  is a
party  to  or  threatened  to  be  made  a  party to any Proceeding (including a
Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor)
against all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including  all  interest,  assessments  and other  charges  paid or  payable in
connection with or in respect of such Expenses,  judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement)  actually and  reasonably  incurred by Indemnitee in
connection with the Proceeding.

      8.  CONTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF JOINT LIABILITY.

          (a) Whether or not  any  of  the  indemnification,  defense  and  hold
harmless rights provided in Sections 3, 4, 5, 7(a) and 7(b) hereof are available
in  respect  of  any  Proceeding  in  which  the  Company is jointly liable with
Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall pay, in
the  first  instance,  the  entire  amount of any judgment or settlement of such
Proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such  payment, and  the
Company hereby waives and  relinquishes  any right of  contribution  it may have
against  Indemnitee.  The  Company  shall not enter into any  settlement  of any
Proceeding in which the Company is jointly  liable with  Indemnitee (or would be
if joined in such  Proceeding)  unless such  settlement  provides for a full and
final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee.

          (b) Without  diminishing  or  impairing the obligations of the Company
set forth in the preceding subparagraph, if, for  any reason,  Indemnitee  shall
elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement  in

                                       -6-

<PAGE>



any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with  Indemnitee (or would
be if joined in such Proceeding),  the Company shall contribute to the amount of
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees),  judgments,  fines and amounts  paid in
settlement  actually incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to
the relative  benefits  received by the Company and all  officers,  directors or
employees  of the Company  other than  Indemnitee  who are  jointly  liable with
Indemnitee  (or  would be if joined in such  Proceeding),  on the one hand,  and
Indemnitee,  on the other hand, from the transaction  from which such Proceeding
arose;  provided,  however,  that  the  proportion  determined  on the  basis of
relative  benefit  may,  to the extent  necessary  to conform to law, be further
adjusted by  reference to the  relative  fault of the Company and all  officers,
directors  or  employees of the Company  other than  Indemnitee  who are jointly
liable with  Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such  Proceeding),  on the one
hand,  and  Indemnitee,  on the other hand, in  connection  with the events that
resulted in such expenses,  judgments,  fines or amounts paid in settlement,  as
well as any other  equitable  considerations.  The relative fault of the Company
and all officers,  directors or employees of the Company  other than  Indemnitee
who  are  jointly  liable  with  Indemnitee  (or  would  be if  joined  in  such
Proceeding),  on the one  hand,  and  Indemnitee,  on the other  hand,  shall be
determined  by  reference  to,  among  other  things,  the degree to which their
actions  were  motivated by intent to gain  personal  profit or  advantage,  the
degree to which their liability is primary or secondary, and the degree to which
their conduct is active or passive.

          (c) The  Company  hereby agrees to fully indemnify,  defend  and  hold
harmless  Indemnitee  from any claims for  contribution  which may be brought by
officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who may be
jointly liable with Indemnitee.

      9.  EXCLUSIONS.   Notwithstanding any  provision  in  this  Agreement, the
Company shall not be  obligated  under this Agreement  to make any  indemnity in
connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

          (a) for which payment has actually been  received by or  on behalf  of
Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except  with
respect to any excess beyond the amount actually  received  under any  insurance
policy or other indemnity provision; or

          (b) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and  sale  (or
sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar  provisions  of  state statutory
law or common law; or

          (c) except as otherwise provided in Sections 14(d)-(f)  hereof,  prior
to a Change in Control,  in connection  with any  Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding)  initiated by  Indemnitee,  including any Proceeding (or any part of
any  Proceeding)  initiated by Indemnitee  against the Company or its directors,
officers,  employees or other indemnitees,  unless (i) the Board of Directors of
the Company  authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding)  prior to
its  initiation or (ii) the Company  provides the  indemnification,  in its sole
discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law.

      10. ADVANCES OF EXPENSES; DEFENSE OF CLAIM.

         (a) Notwithstanding  any  provision of this Agreement to the  contrary,
the Company shall advance the expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
any  Proceeding  within  ten (10) days  after the  receipt  by the  Company of a
statement or statements  requesting  such  advances  from time to time,  whether
prior  to or  after  final  disposition  of any  Proceeding.  Advances  shall be
unsecured  and  interest  free.   Advances  shall  be  made  without  regard  to
Indemnitee's  ability to repay the expenses and without  regard to  Indemnitee's
ultimate  entitlement  to  indemnification  under the other  provisions  of this
Agreement.  Advances  shall  include any and all  reasonable  Expenses  incurred
pursuing  an action to enforce  this right of  advancement,  including  Expenses
incurred  preparing  and  forwarding  statements  to the  Company to support the
advances  claimed.  The  Indemnitee  shall qualify for advances  solely upon the
execution  and  delivery to the  Company of an  undertaking  providing  that the
Indemnitee  undertakes  to repay the advance to the extent that it is ultimately
determined  that  Indemnitee is not entitled to be  indemnified  by the Company.
This  Section  10(a) shall not apply to any claim made by  Indemnitee  for which
indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 9.

         (b)  The Company will be entitled to participate in the  Proceeding  at
its own expense.

         (c)  The Company shall not settle any action,  claim  or Proceeding (in
whole or in part) which would impose any Expense,  judgment,  fine,  penalty  or
limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent.

      11. PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFICATION AND APPLICATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) Within sixty (60) days after the actual receipt by  Indemnitee  of
notice that he or she is a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise)
in any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall submit  to  the  Company  a  written  notice
identifying the Proceeding. The omission by the Indemnitee to notify the Company
will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to  Indemnitee
(i) otherwise  than under this Agreement, and (ii) under this Agreement only  to
the  extent the Company can establish that such omission to notify  resulted  in
actual prejudice to the Company.

          (b) Indemnitee  shall  thereafter  deliver  to  the  Company a written
application to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indemnitee in accordance with
this Agreement.  Such  application(s)  may be delivered from time to time and at
such time(s) as  Indemnitee  deems  appropriate  in his or her sole  discretion.
Following such a written  application  for  indemnification  by Indemnitee,  the
Indemnitee's  entitlement to  indemnification  shall be determined  according to
Section 12(a) of this Agreement.

      12. PROCEDURE UPON APPLICATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to
Section 11(b), a determination, if required by applicable law,  with respect  to
Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case  by  one  of
the  following methods, which shall be at the election of Indemnitee:  (i) by  a
majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum  of
the Board; or (ii) by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board ,  a
copy  of  which  shall  be  delivered to Indemnitee. If it is so determined that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,


                                       -8-

<PAGE>



payment  to   Indemnitee   shall  be  made  within  ten  (10)  days  after  such
determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person, persons or
entity making such  determination  with respect to  Indemnitee's  entitlement to
indemnification,  including  providing  to such  person,  persons or entity upon
reasonable  advance  request  any  documentation  or  information  which  is not
privileged  or  otherwise  protected  from  disclosure  and which is  reasonably
available to Indemnitee  and  reasonably  necessary to such  determination.  Any
costs or expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees and  disbursements)  incurred by
Indemnitee  in so  cooperating  with the person,  persons or entity  making such
determination  shall be borne by the Company  (irrespective of the determination
as to  Indemnitee's  entitlement  to  indemnification)  and the  Company  hereby
indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

          (b) In the event the determination of entitlement  to  indemnification
is to be made by  Independent  Counsel  pursuant to Section  12(a)  hereof,  the
Independent  Counsel  shall be selected as provided in this Section  12(b).  The
Independent  Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee  (unless  Indemnitee  shall
request that such selection be made by the Board of  Directors),  and Indemnitee
shall give  written  notice to the Company  advising  it of the  identity of the
Independent  Counsel so selected.  If the Independent Counsel is selected by the
Board of Directors, the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising
him of the identity of the  Independent  Counsel so selected.  In either  event,
Indemnitee  or the Company,  as the case may be, may,  within 10 days after such
written notice of selection shall have been received,  deliver to the Company or
to  Indemnitee,  as the case  may be, a  written  objection  to such  selection;
provided,  however,  that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that
the  Independent   Counsel  so  selected  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of
"Independent  Counsel"  as  defined  in  Section  2 of this  Agreement,  and the
objection  shall  set  forth  with  particularity  the  factual  basis  of  such
assertion.  Absent a proper and timely  objection,  the person so selected shall
act  as  Independent   Counsel.  If  such  written  objection  is  so  made  and
substantiated,  the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent
Counsel  unless and until such  objection  is  withdrawn or a court of competent
jurisdiction  has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20
days after  submission by Indemnitee  of a written  request for  indemnification
pursuant  to  Section  11(a)  hereof,  no  Independent  Counsel  shall have been
selected and not objected to,  either the Company or  Indemnitee  may petition a
court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have
been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's  selection of  Independent
Counsel and/or for the  appointment as Independent  Counsel of a person selected
by the  Court or by such  other  person as the Court  shall  designate,  and the
person  with  respect to whom all  objections  are so  resolved or the person so
appointed shall act as Independent  Counsel under Section 12(a) hereof. Upon the
due commencement of any judicial  proceeding or arbitration  pursuant to Section
14(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of
any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards
of professional conduct then prevailing).

          (c) The  Company  agrees  to  pay  the reasonable fees and expenses of
 Independent Counsel.

      13. PRESUMPTIONS AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.

          (a) In   making  a  determination  with  respect  to  entitlement  to
indemnification   hereunder,  the  person  or  persons  or  entity  making  such
determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this  Agreement if  Indemnitee  has submitted a request for  indemnification  in
accordance with Section 11(b) of this Agreement,  and the Company shall have the
burden of proof to overcome that  presumption  in connection  with the making by
any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company  (including by its  directors or  independent
legal counsel) to have made a  determination  prior to the  commencement  of any
action  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  that  indemnification  is  proper  in the
circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor
an  actual   determination  by  the  Company  (including  by  its  directors  or
independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable  standard
of  conduct,  shall be a defense  to the  action or  create a  presumption  that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

          (b) If  the  person, persons  or  entity  empowered  or selected under
Section  12  of  this  Agreement  to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification  shall not have made a  determination  within  thirty  (30) days
after   receipt  by  the  Company  of  the  request   therefor,   the  requisite
determination  of  entitlement to  indemnification  shall be deemed to have been
made and  Indemnitee  shall be  entitled to such  indemnification,  absent (i) a
misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact
necessary  to  make  Indemnitee's  statement  not  materially   misleading,   in
connection with the request for  indemnification,  or (ii) a prohibition of such
indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 30-day period
may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional  fifteen (15)
days, if the person,  persons or entity making the determination with respect to
entitlement to  indemnification  in good faith requires such additional time for
the  obtaining  or  evaluating  of  documentation  and/or  information  relating
thereto.

          (c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter
therein, by judgment,  order,  settlement or conviction,  or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent,  shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided
in this  Agreement)  of  itself  adversely  affect  the right of  Indemnitee  to
indemnification  or create a  presumption  that  Indemnitee  did not act in good
faith and in a manner  which he  reasonably  believed to be in or not opposed to
the best  interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal  Proceeding,
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

          (d) Reliance as Safe Harbor. For purposes of any determination of good
faith,  Indemnitee  shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if  Indemnitee's
action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise,  including
financial  statements,  or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers
of the  Enterprise  in the  course of their  duties,  or on the  advice of legal
counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to
the Enterprise by an independent  certified public accountant or by an appraiser
or other expert selected by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 13(d)
shall  not  be  deemed  to be  exclusive  or to  limit  in  any  way  the  other
circumstances  in which  the  Indemnitee  may be deemed or found to have met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.



                                      -10-

<PAGE>



         (e) Actions of Others. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act,
of any other director, officer, trustee, partner,  managing  member,  fiduciary,
agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not  be  imputed  to  Indemnitee   for
purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.

      14. REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE.

         (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant  to  Section
12 of this Agreement that  Indemnitee is not entitled to  indemnification  under
this  Agreement,  (ii)  advancement  of Expenses is not timely made  pursuant to
Section  10  of  this  Agreement,  (iii)  no  determination  of  entitlement  to
indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement
within 45 days after receipt by the Company of the request for  indemnification,
(iv) payment of  indemnification  is not made pursuant to Section 5 , 6, 7, 8 or
the last sentence of Section 12(a) of this Agreement  within ten (10) days after
receipt  by the  Company  of a  written  request  therefor,  or (v)  payment  of
indemnification  pursuant to Section 3 or 4 of this Agreement is not made within
ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by the Delaware
Court (as defined  below) to such  indemnification  or  advancement of Expenses.
Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be
conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association.  The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's
right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.

         (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made  pursuant to
Section   12(a)  of  this   Agreement   that   Indemnitee  is  not  entitled  to
indemnification,  any judicial  proceeding or arbitration  commenced pursuant to
this  Section 14 shall be  conducted  in all  respects  as a de novo  trial,  or
arbitration,  on the merits and Indemnitee  shall not be prejudiced by reason of
that adverse determination.  In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced
pursuant  to this  Section  14 the  Company  shall  have the  burden of  proving
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the
case may be, and the Company may not refer to or  introduce  into  evidence  any
determination  pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement adverse to Indemnitee
for any purpose.  If Indemnitee  commences a judicial  proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to this Section 14,  Indemnitee  shall not be required to reimburse the
Company for any advances  pursuant to Section 10 until a final  determination is
made with respect to Indemnitee's  entitlement to  indemnification  (as to which
all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed).

         (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant  to Section  12(a)
of  this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,  the  Company
shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding  or  arbitration
commenced pursuant to this Section 14, absent (i) a misstatement  by  Indemnitee
of a  material  fact,  or an  omission  of a  material  fact  necessary  to make
Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request
for  indemnification,  or  (ii) a  prohibition  of  such  indemnification  under
applicable law.

         (d) In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 14, seeks  a
judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under,
or to recover  damages  for  breach  of,  this  Agreement,  Indemnitee  shall be
entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be

                                      -11-

<PAGE>



indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him in such judicial  adjudication  or  arbitration.  If it shall be
determined in said  judicial  adjudication  or  arbitration  that  Indemnitee is
entitled to receive part but not all of the  indemnification  or  advancement of
Expenses  sought,  the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company,
and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses reasonably
incurred  by  Indemnitee  in  connection  with  such  judicial  adjudication  or
arbitration .

         (e) The Company shall  be  precluded  from  asserting  in  any judicial
proceeding  or  arbitration  commenced  pursuant  to this  Section  14 that  the
procedures  and  presumptions  of this  Agreement  are not  valid,  binding  and
enforceable  and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator
that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.

         (f) The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indemnitee to
the fullest  extent  permitted by law against all Expenses  and, if requested by
Indemnitee,  shall  (within  ten (10) days after the  Company's  receipt of such
written  request)  advance such  Expenses to  Indemnitee,  which are incurred by
Indemnitee in connection with any judicial  proceeding or arbitration brought by
Indemnitee for (i)  indemnification or advances of Expenses by the Company under
the Agreement or any other  agreement or provision of the Company's  Certificate
of  Incorporation  or By-laws  now or  hereafter  in effect or (ii)  recovery or
advances under any insurance policy  maintained by any person for the benefit of
Indemnitee,  regardless  of whether  Indemnitee  ultimately  is determined to be
entitled to such indemnification, advance or insurance recovery, as the case may
be.

      15. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST. In the event of a Potential Change in Control,
the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee,  create a "Trust" for the
benefit of Indemnitee  and from time to time upon written  request of Indemnitee
shall fund such Trust in an amount  sufficient  to satisfy any and all  Expenses
reasonably  anticipated  at the time of each  such  request  to be  incurred  in
connection with investigating,  preparing for, participating in or defending any
Proceedings,  and any and all  judgments,  fines,  penalties and amounts paid in
settlement  (including  all  interest,  assessments  and other  charges  paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments,  fines penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) in connection with any and all Proceedings from time
to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid.
The  trustee of the Trust (the  "Trustee")  shall be a bank or trust  company or
other individual or entity chosen by the Indemnitee and approved by the Company.
Nothing in this Section 15 shall  relieve the Company of any of its  obligations
under  this  Agreement.  The  amount or  amounts  to be  deposited  in the Trust
pursuant  to  the  foregoing  funding  obligation  shall  be  determined  by the
Disinterested Directors. The terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a Change
in Control (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal  thereof invaded,
without the written consent of the  Indemnitee,  (ii) the Trustee shall advance,
within two business days of a request by the  Indemnitee  and upon the execution
and  delivery to the Company of an  undertaking  providing  that the  Indemnitee
undertakes to repay the advance to the extent that it is  ultimately  determined
that  Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified  by the Company,  any and all
Expenses to the  Indemnitee,  (iii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the
Company in accordance  with the funding  obligations  set forth above,  (iv) the
Trustee  shall  promptly  pay  to the  Indemnitee  all  amounts  for  which  the
Indemnitee  shall be entitled to  indemnification  pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise,  and (v) all  unexpended  funds in such  Trust  shall  revert  to the


                                      -12-

<PAGE>


Company upon a final determination by the Disinterested  Directors,  Independent
Counsel  or a court of  competent  jurisdiction,  as the  case may be,  that the
Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms of this Agreement.

      16. SECURITY. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the
extent requested by the Indemnitee and approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company, the Company may at any time and from time to time provide security to
the Indemnitee for the Company's obligations hereunder through an irrevocable
bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral. Any such security, once
provided to the Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee.

      17. NON-EXCLUSIVITY; SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS;  INSURANCE; SUBROGATION.

          (a) The  rights  of  indemnification  and  to  receive  advancement of
Expenses as  provided by this  Agreement  shall not be deemed  exclusive  of any
other rights to which  Indemnitee may at any time be entitled  under  applicable
law, the Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  the Company's By- laws, any
agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No
amendment,  alteration or repeal of this  Agreement or of any  provision  hereof
shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee  under this Agreement in respect
of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate  Status prior
to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware
law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or
advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's By-
laws and this Agreement,  it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee
shall enjoy by this  Agreement the greater  benefits so afforded by such change.
No right or remedy  herein  conferred  is intended to be  exclusive of any other
right or remedy,  and every other right and remedy  shall be  cumulative  and in
addition to every other right and remedy  given  hereunder  or now or  hereafter
existing at law or in equity or  otherwise.  The  assertion or employment of any
right or remedy  hereunder,  or  otherwise,  shall not  prevent  the  concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

          (b) To the extent that the Company maintains an  insurance  policy  or
policies  providing  liability  insurance  for  directors,  officers,  trustees,
partners, managing members, fiduciaries,  employees, or agents of the Company or

amounts  payable as a result of such  Proceeding in accordance with the terms of
such policies.

        o  Weighted 50/50
        o  Scale:  see attached scale ranging from 0 to 150% of target payout
        o  To earn the EBITDA portion of the AIP, the Credit Covenant threshold
           must be achieved (75% of Budget) for the covenant periods as follows:

             o  12/23/00 to 12/31/01       $(5.3MM)
             o  4/1/01 to 3/31/02          $(3.7MM)

*FY02 Annual Incentive Plan Scale
---------------------------------

EBITDA:  Budget = $3.916 million
         Target = $4.416 million

         EBITDA Earned             % of Target Bonus Payout
         -------------             ------------------------
         Less than $3.916MM                   0
         $3.916MM                            50
         $4.416MM                           100
         $5.000MM                           150



ROI %: Target = Budget = .6% = EBIT/Average Total Investment = $278M/$45,233M

                  ROI                       % of Target Bonus Payout
                  ---                       ------------------------
                  Less than .3%                        0
                  .3%                                 50
                  .6%                                100
                  1.6%                               150


Sample Calculation (weighting of EBITDA and ROI is 50/50)

Example:
        o  EBITDA is $4.6MM and ROI is 1.7%
        o  Target incentive is $175,000 (50% of base salary on June 30, 2002)
        o  Calculation:
           o  .5(1.0 * 175,000) + .5(1.5 * 175,000) = $218,750
           o  If an EBITDA covenant threshold was not met, then the payout would
              just be the ROI part of the bonus or $131,250 in this example.

4. Payout Provisions

          (a) If EBT and  currency  targets  are met at  different  levels,  the
          payout is the sum of the two individual  payouts.  Example:  If annual
          plan results for EBT equals Target at $22.0M (20% Payout) and currency
          96.5% (10% Payout), the total payout will be 30% of Base Salary.

          (b) All  payouts  will be in cash  and  paid  from  Telmark  earnings.
          Payouts  shall be made in a lump sum  within 90 days  after the end of
          the term of the respective incentive plan.

          (c) EBT will be  calculated  after the  accrual of the expense for the
          incentive.

5.  Conditions

          (a) If the employee voluntarily  terminates employment for good reason
          (as hereinafter defined) or if Agway terminates his employment without
          cause (as  hereinafter  defined)  during the plan  period,  he will be
          eligible for a payout under both plans.  The payout will be calculated
          on a pro-rated  basis  (using  completed  weeks of service  during the
          incentive  period)  representative  of the employee's period of active
          full time employment during the term of each such plan.


          (b) If the employee dies, retires (as hereinafter defined), or becomes
          permanently  disabled  to  such a  degree  that he is  prevented  from
          performing  the usual duties of his position,  he (or his estate) will
          be  eligible  for a  payout  under  both  plans.  The  payout  will be
          calculated  on a pro-rated  basis  (using  completed  weeks of service
          during the incentive  period)  representative of the employee's period
          of active full time employment during the term of each such plan.

          (c) If there is a change of control (as defined in the Indemnification
          Agreement between Agway Inc. and the employee) during the plan period,
          the  employee  will be  deemed  fully  vested in both the  annual  and
          long-term incentive plans. Fully vested means the payout will be fully
          earned without a reduction.

          (d) The payout for three  events,  5(a),  (b), and (c) above,  will be
          calculated based upon target  performance.  Upon the occurrence of one

                                        2
<PAGE>

          of these three  events (a),  (b) or (c) the  employee  (or his estate)
          will also receive a payout  equal to 100% of his base  salary.  Payout
          for these three events,  5(a),  (b), and (c) above and payment of base
          salary shall be made in a lump sum within 90 days after the occurrence
          of the event.

          (e) If the employee  voluntarily quits without good reason or if Agway
          terminates  his  employment for cause during an unexpired plan period,
          he will not be eligible for any part of any payout,  payments or other
          compensation  identified  in this  document  for the  applicable  plan
          period.

          (f)  Incentives  earned  under  this plan are taken into  account  for
          purposes  of Agway's  employee  benefit  plan  programs  to the extent
          provided by the terms of those programs in effect at the time payments
          are made.

          (g) Under any of the events  described in 5(a), (b) or (c) above,  (i)
          the  employee  will be deemed on leave status in order to receive full
          employee benefits at active employee  contribution rates for one year,
          and  (ii)  the  employee  will  receive  for one  year  following  his
          termination executive level career transition assistance services by a
          firm selected by the employee and paid for by Agway.

In these incentive plans, "you" and "your" refer to and mean the employee.

For  purposes  of these  incentive  plans,  "cause"  means  termination  of your
employment  by  Agway  acting  in good  faith  due to  your  (i)  willful  gross
misconduct or gross negligence with respect to your responsibilities,  including
but not limited to misappropriating  any funds or property of Agway,  committing
any act involving fraud,  failing to perform in all material respects any duties
reasonably  required in the course of your  employment  (other than such failure
resulting from your  incapacity due to illness) after Agway has notified you and
you have failed to correct such failure within 10 days of such notice, violating
in any material  respect any written  policy of Agway or of your duty of loyalty
owed to  Agway,  or  acting  in any way that is  materially  detrimental  to the
business  reputation  of Agway,  (ii)  conviction  of, or a plea of guilty or no
contest to, a felony or crime of moral turpitude,  or (iii) willful repeated use
of alcohol or drugs,  or your untreated  alcoholism or drug abuse,  in each case
impairing your ability to perform your executive responsibilities.

For purposes of these  incentive  plans,  "good  reason"  means  termination  of
employment  by you  acting in good faith due to any of the  following  occurring

                                        3
<PAGE>

without your prior consent (i) any adverse change in your title or any change in
your  reporting  relationship,  (ii) any  diminution in your  responsibility  or
authority  or the  assignment  to you of  duties  which  are  inconsistent  with
responsibilities  normally  performed  by an  executive at your level in similar
businesses, (iii) any diminution in your compensation or benefits other than (a)
a diminution in your  compensation  that is  implemented  in connection  with an
across  the board  reduction  of  executive  salaries  of the  Company  or (b) a
modification  or elimination of any benefit plan that affects other employees of
Agway or other senior  executives of Agway generally,  (iv) the requirement that
you relocate  outside of the Syracuse,  NY area, or (v) the requirement that you
sign or be bound by a written noncompetition agreement.

For purposes of these  incentive  plans,  "retire" means attaining the age of 59
1/2 and having at least 3 years of continuous  active full-time  employment with
Agway immediately prior to the date of retirement.

For purposes of these incentive plans, "Base Salary" means the employee's annual
salary at the time of the event or indicated  determination  date before bonuses
or other incentives.

6. Miscellaneous

   (a)    The incentive plans are not a contract for continued employment and do
          not  limit  the  right of Agway to terminate your employment. You are,
          and shall remain, an employee at will.

   (b)    Annual  incentive  plans targeted at 50% of Base Salary and multi-year
          incentive plans  targeted at 75% of Base Salary with substantially the
          same parameters  for  payment as  set forth in Section 1 above will be
          initiated in each ensuing fiscal year.

Re:           INCENTIVE
              ---------

Dan,  please refer to the following  regarding the  components of your incentive
compensation  that may be  payable  in the event of  Agway's  "sale of  Telmark"
during  Agway's  fiscal year ending June 30, 2003.  This letter  supercedes  and
replaces  the  November  30, 2001 memo from Jerry Seeber to you and the July 19,
2002 memo from me to you.

     1.   If you  voluntarily  leave Agway at the end of the closing of any sale
          of Telmark during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, whether or not
          to join the acquirer,  under your Executive  Incentive Plan for Period
          Beginning  July 1, 2002,  you will be  considered  to have  terminated
          employment  for "good reason."  Therefore,  you will be eligible for a
          payout of one times your base  salary and a payout of both your annual
          and multi-year incentives at target, each, pro-rated for time in plan.

          In addition,  Telmark will also provide a retention  incentive  ("stay
          pay") for you to stay as President of Telmark during the period ending
          September 30, 2003 (or earlier date if  employment  is terminated  for
          "good reason") of $230,022. You will receive 50% of the stay pay as of
          March 31, 2003 and the  remaining 50% as of September 30, 2003. In the
          event of a sale of Telmark before September 30, 2003, you will receive
          100% of the stay pay, less any stay pay payments previously received.

     2.   In addition to any  payments  that may be made to you pursuant to your
          Executive  Incentive Plan and for stay pay,  Telmark will also provide
          an incentive for any sale of Telmark through  September 30, 2003. This
          incentive is provided in recognition of the added responsibilities you
          have  assumed and will  assume to prepare  for and  complete a sale of
          Telmark.

          This component will provide you with an incentive/bonus  payment equal
          to the difference between (a) $985,000,  and (b) the amount payable to
          you pursuant to paragraph 1. In other words,  if the closing of a sale
          of Telmark  occurs on or before  September 30, 2003, and if you remain
          as President of Telmark  through the closing date,  you will receive a
          combined  amount  equal to  $985,000,  a portion of which will be paid
          pursuant to your Executive Incentive Plan, a portion for stay pay, and
          the balance of which will be paid as an incentive/bonus  for a sale of
          Telmark.  This  payment  would be made  regardless  of the actual sale
          price.

     3.   Your right to the incentive/bonus payment described above, however, is
          subject to the following added conditions:

          a.   No amount will be payable pursuant to paragraph 2 if  the closing
               date of the sale of Telmark does not occur on or before September
               30, 2003.

          b.   No  amount  will  be  payable  pursuant  to  paragraph  2 if  you
               voluntarily  terminate your employment  prior to the closing of a
               sale of Telmark or if you  continue  your  employment  with Agway
               after the closing of a sale of Telmark.

          c.   The  amount  payable  pursuant  to  paragraphs  1  and  2  is  an
               obligation of Telmark LLC.

          d.   This letter is not  intended  as a  duplication  of amounts  that
               would otherwise be payable to you under your Executive  Incentive
               Plan.  The  provisions  of your  Executive  Incentive  Plan shall
               remain in force and effect.

          e.   In  order to avoid  the  application  of  Internal  Revenue  Code
               Sections  280G and 4999 to any payments  that may be made to you,
               in no event will you be  entitled  to  payments  pursuant to this
               memo,  your  Executive  Incentive  Plan, or otherwise  that would
               result in the  application  of the  non-deduction  and excise tax
               consequences  imposed by Internal  Revenue Code Sections 280G and
               4999.  Payments  to you  pursuant to this memo will be limited to
               the extent necessary to avoid any such application.

     4.   "Sale  of  Telmark"  means a sale of  Agway's  ownership  interest  in
          Telmark,  a sale of  substantially  all of the  assets of Telmark or a
          transfer of  substantially  all of the employees of Telmark to another
          party,  such other party to be administering  substantially all of the
          assets of Telmark.

Dan,  as  evidence of receipt and  acceptance  of the  contents of this  letter,
please sign and return one copy of this letter. Thank you.

4. Payout Provisions

     (a) If EBITDA and Leverage Targets are met  at  different  levels  for  the
         purposeof annual incentive calculation,  the payout is the sum of the
         two  individual  payouts.  Example: If annual results for EBITDA equals
         Target  at $34.428M  (15%  Payout) and annual  leverage  result  equals
         maximum   payout level of 3.2 to 1 (45% Payout),  the total payout will
         be 60% of Base Salary.

     (b) All payouts will be in cash and shall be made in a lump sum  within  90
         days after the end of the term of the respective incentive plan.

     (c) EBITDA  will  be  calculated  after  the accrual of the expense for the
         incentive.

     (d) EBITDA  financial   covenants  under  Agway  Inc.'s   principal  credit
         agreements   in  effect  at the  time of each  reporting  period,  both
         quarterly and  annually,  must be exceeded in order for a payout  to be
         made  under  the  EBITDA  incentive  calculations  contained  in   this
         agreement.

5. Conditions

         (a) If the employee voluntarily terminates employment  for good  reason
         (as hereinafter defined) or if Agway  terminates his employment without
         cause (as  hereinafter  defined)  during  the plan  period,  he will be
         eligible for a  payout under both plans.  The payout will be calculated
         on a pro-rated   basis  (using  completed  weeks of service  during the
         incentive   period)  representative  of the employee's period of active
         full  time employment during the term of each such plan.

         (b) If the employee dies, retires (as hereinafter defined),  or becomes
         permanently   disabled  to  such a  degree  that he is  prevented  from
         performing  the  usual duties of his position,  he (or his estate) will
         be  eligible   for a  payout  under  both  plans.  The  payout  will be
         calculated   on a pro-rated  basis  (using  completed  weeks of service
         during  the incentive  period)  representative of the employee's period
         of  active full time employment during the term of each such plan.

         (c) If there is a change of control (as defined in the Indemnification
         Agreement between  Agway Inc. and the employee) during the plan period,
         the  employee  will  be deemed fully  vested in  both  the  annual  and
         long-term incentive plans. Fully vested means the payout  will be fully
         earned without a reduction.

                                        2
<PAGE>

         (d) The payout  for  three  events,  5(a), (b),  and (c) above, will be
         calculated based upon target performance. Upon the occurrence of one of
         these three events (a), (b) or (c) the  employee  (or his  estate) will
         also receive a  payout  equal  to  100% of  his base salary. Payout for
         these three events, 5(a), (b), and (c) above and payment of base salary
         shall be made  in a lump sum within 90 days after the occurrence of the
         event.

         (e) If the employee  voluntarily  quits without good reason or if Agway
         terminates his employment for cause during an unexpired plan period, he
         will  not be eligible for any part  of any  payout, payments  or  other
         compensation identified  in  this  document  for  the  applicable  plan
         period.

         (f) Incentives earned  under  this  plan  are  taken  into  account for
         purposes   of Agway's  employee  benefit  plan  programs  to the extent
         provided  by the terms of those programs in effect at the time payments
         are made.

         (g)  Under any of the events  described in 5(a), (b) or (c) above,  (i)
         the   employee  will be deemed on leave status in order to receive full
         employee benefits at active employee  contribution rates for one year,
         and   (ii)  the  employee  will  receive  for one  year  following  his
         termination  executive level career transition assistance services by a
         firm selected  by the employee and paid for by Agway.

In these incentive plans, "you" and "your" refer to and mean the employee.

For  purposes  of these  incentive  plans,  "cause"  means  termination  of your
employment  by  Agway  acting  in good  faith  due to  your  (i)  willful  gross
misconduct or gross negligence with respect to your responsibilities,  including
but not limited to misappropriating  any funds or property of Agway,  committing
any act involving fraud,  failing to perform in all material respects any duties
reasonably  required in the course of your  employment  (other than such failure
resulting from your  incapacity due to illness) after Agway has notified you and
you have failed to correct such failure within 10 days of such notice, violating
in any material  respect any written  policy of Agway or of your duty of loyalty
owed to  Agway,  or  acting  in any way that is  materially  detrimental  to the
business  reputation  of Agway,  (ii)  conviction  of, or a plea of guilty or no
contest to, a felony or crime of moral turpitude,  or (iii) willful repeated use
of alcohol or drugs,  or your untreated  alcoholism or drug abuse,  in each case
impairing your ability to perform your executive responsibilities.

                                        3
<PAGE>


For purposes of these  incentive  plans,  "good  reason"  means  termination  of
employment  by you  acting in good faith due to any of the  following  occurring
without your prior consent (i) any adverse change in your title or any change in
your  reporting  relationship,  (ii) any  diminution in your  responsibility  or
authority  or the  assignment  to you of  duties  which  are  inconsistent  with
responsibilities  normally  performed  by an  executive at your level in similar
businesses, (iii) any diminution in your compensation or benefits other than (a)
a diminution in your  compensation  that is  implemented  in connection  with an
across  the board  reduction  of  executive  salaries  of the  Company  or (b) a
modification  or elimination of any benefit plan that affects other employees of
Agway or other senior  executives of Agway generally,  (iv) the requirement that
you relocate  outside of the Syracuse,  NY area, or (v) the requirement that you
sign or be bound by a written noncompetition agreement.

For purposes of these  incentive  plans,  "retire" means attaining the age of 59
1/2 and having at least 3 years of continuous  active full-time  employment with
Agway immediately prior to the date of retirement.

For purposes of these incentive plans, "Base Salary" means the employee's annual
salary at the time of the event or indicated  determination  date before bonuses
or other incentives.

6.       Miscellaneous

         (a) The incentive plans are not a contract for continued employment and
             do  not  limit the right of Agway to terminate your employment. You
             are, and shall remain, an employee at will.

         (b) Annual  incentive  plans  targeted at 50% of Base Salary and multi-
             year incentive  plans  targeted  at  75%  of   Base   Salary   with
             substantially  the  same  parameters  for  payment  as set forth in
             Section 1 above will be initiated in each ensuing fiscal year.

         (c) All payments under the incentive plans are subject  to  income  tax
             and employment tax withholding.

Re:      Incentive

Jerry,  please refer to the following regarding the components of your incentive
compensation  that  will be  payable  in the  event  of  Agway's  sale of  Agway
Insurance Company:

1.   If you  voluntarily  leave  Agway at the time of the closing of any sale of
     Agway Insurance  Company,  whether or not to join the acquirer,  under your
     Executive  Incentive  Plans for Period  Beginning July 1, 2001, you will be
     considered to have terminated employment for "good reason." Therefore,  you
     will be eligible for a payout of one times your base salary and a payout of
     both your annual and  multi-year  incentives at target,  each pro-rated for
     time in plan. An example of your payout if closing were to occur on May 31,
     02, follows:

         Closing for an Agway Insurance Company Sale Occurs 5/31/02
<TABLE>

         <S>                                                                         <C>
         Base Salary                                                                 $338,000

         Annual incentive pro-rated at target for period 5/31/02-6/30/02
                           (50% salary target x 11 months/12 months)                  154,917

         Multi-year incentive pro-rated at target for period 5/31/02-6/30/03
                           (75% salary target x 11 months/24 months)                  116,188
                                                                                      -------

                                                              Total                  $609,105
</TABLE>
     The  foregoing  is only an example of the cash  payment that may be made to
     you pursuant to your Executive Incentive Plans for Period Beginning July 1,
     2001.  (This  is not  intended  as a  duplication  of  amounts  that  would
     otherwise  be  payable  to you under that  plan.)  The  provisions  of your
     Executive Incentive Plan shall remain in full force and effect.

2.   In  addition  to any  payments  that  may be made to you  pursuant  to your
     Executive   Incentive   Plan,   Agway  will  also  provide  an   additional
     incentive/bonus  for you to stay as  President of Agway  Insurance  Company
     through any sale of Agway Insurance Company. This section is in recognition
     of the added  responsibilities  you have assumed and will assume to prepare
     for and complete a sale of Agway Insurance Company.

     Specifically  this  component  will  provide  you  with an  incentive/bonus
     payment equal to 2% of the gross sale price that Agway receives from such a
     sales  transaction  or one times  your  current  base  salary of  $338,000,
     whichever is greater. This payment would be made within 30 days of closing.

3.   Your right to the  incentive/bonus  payment  described above,  however,  is
     subject to the following added conditions:

         a.   No amount will be payable  pursuant to paragraph 2, if the closing
              of the sale of Agway Insurance Company does not occur on or before
              December 31, 2002;  however,  if a definitive  agreement  has been
              executed by all parties by December 31, 2002,  and such  agreement
              sets  forth a  required  closing  date of no later  than March 31,
              2003,  then you  will  still be  entitled  to the  incentive/bonus
              payment under paragraph 2 of this letter;

         b.   No  amount  will  be  payable  pursuant  to  paragraph  2,  if you
              voluntarily  terminate your  employment  prior to the closing of a
              sale  of  Agway  Insurance  Company,   or  if  you  continue  your
              employment  with  Agway  after  the  closing  of a sale  of  Agway
              Insurance Company; and

         c.   In  order  to avoid  the  application  of  Internal  Revenue  Code
              Sections 280G and 4999 to any payments that may be made to you, in
              no event will you be entitled  to payments  pursuant to this memo,
              your Executive  Incentive  Plan, or otherwise that would result in
              the application of the non- deduction and excise tax  consequences
              imposed by Internal Revenue Code Sections 280G and 4999.  Payments

                                                        ----------------
Disclosure Schedules, all material Tax Returns that were required to be filed by
or on behalf  of  Company  have  been  prepared  and  filed in  accordance  with
applicable Legal Requirements  (taking into account any valid extensions of time
for filing).  All such Tax Returns were true and correct in all material aspects
and there is no unresolved audit, claim,  adjustment,  or deficiency proposed or
assessed  concerning any Tax Liability relating to Company.  All Tax Liabilities
that have become due  pursuant  to any such Tax  Returns and any tax  assessment
relating to Company have been paid,  or provision  has been made for the payment
thereof, except those Tax Liabilities, if any, listed in such Schedule 5.7(a) of
the Disclosure  Schedules  that are being  contested in good faith and for which
adequate reserves  (determined in accordance with SAP) have been provided in the
Financial  Statements.  Any positions  taken on such Tax Returns that could give
rise to a substantial  understatement of federal income Tax to Seller or Company
within  the  meaning  of  Section  6662(d)  of the  Code  either  were  based on
"substantial  authority" or were  "adequately  disclosed"  and had a "reasonable
basis," in each case within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B) of the Code. No
claim has ever been made by any jurisdiction  where no Tax Return has been filed
by or on behalf of  Company  that  Company  is or may be  subject to Tax by such
jurisdiction.

                           (b)   There  are  no  agreements,  waivers  or  other
arrangements  providing  for the extension of time with respect to the filing of
any Tax Return,  the payment of any Tax Liability,  or the assessment of any Tax
Liability with respect to Company. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.7(b) of the
Disclosure  Schedules,  there are no Tax Sharing  Arrangements.  Company has not
made,  is not  obligated  to  make,  and  is not a  party  to any  agreement  or
arrangement  under which it might become obligated to make any "excess parachute
payments"  within the meaning of Section  280G of the Code.  No consent has been
given to the  application  of  Section  341(f)  of the Code (or any  predecessor
provision) to Company. No closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code
(or any  predecessor  provision) or any similar  provision of state or local law
has been entered into by or with respect to Company.  No adjustment  pursuant to
Section 481 of the Code (or any predecessor  provision) or any similar provision
of state or local law has been agreed to by or on behalf of Company,  nor is any
such  adjustment  required to be made, by reason of any change in any accounting
method by Company,  nor has any application for any such change been made to any
Tax Governmental  Body.  Neither the IRS nor any other Tax Governmental Body has
proposed  any such  change  or  adjustment  of  accounting  method.  All  ceding
commissions and expenses,  if any, paid or accrued by Company in connection with
any reinsurance arrangement or contract or transaction have been capitalized and
amortized over the life or lives of such reinsurance  arrangement or contract in


                                       16
<PAGE>

accordance   with   applicable  Tax  law.   Company  has  never  been  either  a
"distributing  corporation"  or a  "controlled  corporation"  in  a  transaction
described  in  Section  355 of the  Code.  Except  for the  affiliated  group of
corporations of which Seller is the parent and Company is a member.  Company has
never been a member of any affiliated,  consolidated,  combined or unitary group
or participated in any other arrangement whereby any income, revenues, receipts,
gain or loss of Company was  determined  or taken into  account for Tax purposes
with reference to or in conjunction with any other Person, nor does Company have
any Liability for Taxes for any other Person, except for the affiliated group of
corporations  of which  Seller is the  parent  and  Company  is a member,  under
Treasury  Regulation Section  1.1502-6(a) (or any similar provision of any other
provision of state,  local, or foreign law). Company is not and has never been a

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER
                   -------------------------------------------

                  Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

                  6.1    Organization  and  Good  Standing.  Purchaser  is  a
                         ------------------------------
corporation duly organized,  and validly existing under the laws of the State of
Indiana,  and with all requisite power to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

                  6.2     Authority; No Conflict.
                          ----------------------

                          (a)   This  Agreement  has  been  duly approved by the
Board of Directors of Purchaser.  This Agreement  constitutes the legal,  valid,
and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance
with its terms.

                          (b)   Neither   Purchaser's   execution  and  delivery
of this Agreement nor the performance by Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement will directly or indirectly:

                                (i)    conflict with,  or result in a  violation
         of, any provision  of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
         organizational documents of Purchaser;

                                (ii)   subject to the receipt  of  any  required
         consents,   result  in a violation of any Legal Requirement or Order to
         which Purchaser may be subject; or

                                (iii)  subject to the receipt  of  any  required
         consents,   result  in  a  violation of any Contract to which Purchaser
         is a party or by which Purchaser may be bound.

                          (c)   Except  as  set  forth in Schedule 6.2(c) of the
Disclosure  Schedules, Purchaser is not required to give any notice to or obtain
any  Consent  from  any  Person  or  Governmental  Body  in  connection with the
Contemplated Transactions.

                  6.3    Certain  Proceedings.  There  is  no pending Proceeding
                         --------------------
that has been commenced against  Purchaser and that challenges,  or may have the
effect of preventing,  delaying,  making illegal, or otherwise interfering with,
the Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, no such Proceeding
has been Threatened.

                  6.4    Brokers or Finders.  Purchaser  has  not  incurred  any
                         -------------------
obligation or Liability for brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions or
other similar  payments in connection  with this Agreement and the  Contemplated

<PAGE>

Transactions  for  which  the  Seller  will  directly  or  indirectly  have  any
Liability.

                  6.5    Investment   Representations.  Purchaser  is  acquiring
                         ----------------------------
the Purchased  Shares as an investment,  and not with a view to, or for, sale or
transfer  in  connection  with  any  distribution  thereof,  or for any  sale or
transfer thereof.

                  6.6    Financial and Regulatory  Matters.   Purchaser  has the
                         ---------------------------------
financial   capacity  to  perform  all  of  its  obligations   relating  to  the
Contemplated  Transactions,  and Purchaser has no knowledge of any reason why it
will be unable to obtain any required Governmental Authorization.


                  6.7    Forward-Looking Statements. Purchaser acknowledges that
it has made its decision as to the future  prospects  and  profitability  of the
Company  after Closing based on, among other  things,  the  representations  and
warranties of Seller set forth in this  Agreement and  Purchaser's  own business
review and  judgment,  but not in reliance on any  projections,  predictions  or
similar forward-looking statements by the Seller or anyone acting on its behalf.

                       DUE DILIGENCE; UPDATES TO SCHEDULES
                       -----------------------------------

                  7.1    Completion;  Verification. Prior to entering  into this
                         -------------------------
Agreement,  Purchaser was provided the  opportunity to perform its due diligence
investigation  concerning  Company,  including  the  opportunity  to review such
books, records and documents of Company, and to interview Company management and
personnel  of Seller and  Company,  as  Purchaser  deemed  necessary.  Purchaser
confirms that it has completed its due diligence. Hereafter, Purchaser's further
due  diligence  shall be limited  to  verifying  and  confirming  the  continued
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Seller, and the compliance
of Seller with its covenants,  as set forth in this  Agreement.  Purchaser shall
coordinate  any further  due  diligence  through  Gerald R.  Seeber.  During any
examination  by  Purchaser  pursuant  to the  provisions  of this  Section  7.1,
Purchaser shall not disrupt or adversely  affect any aspect of the operations of
Company or the morale of Company's employees.

                  7.2   Notice of Breach. Purchaser acknowledges that one of the
                        ----------------
purposes of due diligence is to permit Purchaser to conduct  examinations of the
Business,  property  and  assets of the  Company  so as to enable  Purchaser  to
independently  verify whether the  representations  and  warranties  made by the
Seller pursuant to Article 5 are accurate and correct in all material  respects.
Accordingly,  if during the course of  Purchaser's  due  diligence  an  officer,
manager, accountant or attorney acting for or on behalf of Purchaser,  discovers
a fact or  circumstance  which  causes  or would  cause a  reasonable  person to
believe that a Breach of any of the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in Article 5 exists or will result, Purchaser shall provide written notice
thereof to Seller (i) describing, in detail, the extent and nature of the Breach
and (ii) stating, if such is the case, its intention to terminate this Agreement
in the event  that  Seller is unable  to  remedy  Breach  within a  commercially


                                       25
<PAGE>

reasonable  time. The failure to give this notice by Purchaser shall be deemed a
waiver by Purchaser of the Breach.  If, following any such notice,  Seller fails
to  remedy  the  Breach,  or to  otherwise  hold  Purchaser  harmless  from  the
consequences of the Breach,  within a commercially  reasonable  time,  Purchaser
shall have the option to either waive the Breach and close without further claim
against Seller, or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article 12.

                  7.3   Updates to  Schedules. Promptly following the receipt of
                        ---------------------
all  Consents,  Seller  shall  update  any and all of the  Disclosure  Schedules
provided  pursuant to Articles 3 or 5 hereof to reflect each and every change to
each Schedule occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date that would make any Schedule incomplete or inaccurate or which,
if in existence or having occurred as of or prior to the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in any Disclosure Schedule
to this  Agreement  (collectively,  the  "Updated  Schedules").  If any  Updated
Schedule  discloses  a  fact  or  circumstance  relating  to  the  Company  that
constitutes  a Materially  Adverse  Change that is  unacceptable  to  Purchaser,
Purchaser  shall notify Seller of its intention to terminate  this  Agreement by
reason of the Materially Adverse Change unless an appropriate adjustment is made
as hereafter  provided.  In that event,  Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in
good faith  regarding an  appropriate  adjustment of the Purchase Price or other
modification  of this Agreement in light of the Materially  Adverse  Change.  If
Seller and  Purchaser  are unable to agree on such  modification  or  adjustment
within thirty (30) days following Purchaser's notice, Purchaser may either elect
to  Close  notwithstanding  the  Materially  Adverse  Change  or  Purchaser  may
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller.

         a Breach by  Seller,  and Purchaser  and Seller,  having  followed  the
         procedures set forth in Section 7.3, have failed  to  reach   agreement

other party written notice that  noncompliance,  nonperformance  or a breach has
occurred, specifying the nature thereof and the action required to cure and (ii)
such  noncompliance,  nonperformance  or breach  shall  not have  been  cured or

                           (a)   Promptly  after  receipt by a party entitled to
indemnification under Sections 13.2 or 13.3 of notice of the commencement of any
Proceeding  against it, the  indemnified  party shall,  if a claim is to be made
against an  indemnifying  party,  give notice to the  indemnifying  party of the
commencement of the claim.

                           (b)   If any Proceeding referred to in  Section  13.6
(a) is  brought  against  an  indemnified  party  and  it  gives  notice  to the
indemnifying party of the commencement of the Proceeding, the indemnifying party
shall,  upon written notice given within thirty (30) days after the  indemnified
party's notice is given, be entitled to assume the defense of the Proceeding. If
the  indemnifying  party  elects to assume  the  defense  of a  Proceeding,  the
indemnified  party shall turn the Proceeding over to the indemnifying  party who
shall, at its own expense,  assume the contest and the  indemnified  party shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to participate,  at its own expense,  in
the defense  thereof by counsel of its own choice,  and shall cooperate with and
assist the indemnifying party as reasonably  requested by the indemnifying party
in  connection  with the defense or contest,  but the  indemnifying  party shall
retain  control  thereof and have final  authority to  determine  all matters in
connection  therewith.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the indemnifying  party
shall have the right to control the defense,  litigation  and  settlement of the
action only if the  indemnifying  party has agreed in writing to be  responsible
for all costs, expenses,  judgments and liabilities connected with the claim and
provided the indemnified  party with a bond,  letter of credit or other evidence
satisfactory  to  the  indemnified  party,  in  its  sole  discretion,   of  the
indemnifying party's ability to satisfy these obligations.

                  14.1     Tax Returns.
                           -----------

                           (a)   Seller  shall  prepare or cause to be  prepared
(at its own cost and expense and in a manner  consistent with past practice) all
Income Tax  Returns  required to be filed by or on behalf of Company for taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall, on a timely
basis,  file such Tax Returns  and pay the  amounts  shown as due thereon to the
appropriate  Governmental Body. Subject to the foregoing,  the income of Company
for the taxable year of Seller that includes the Closing shall be determined for
the period up to and  including the Closing Date by closing the books of Company
as of the end of the Closing Date or by any other reasonable method agreed to by
Seller and Purchaser, except that (i) exemptions, allowances, or deductions that
are  calculated  on an annual  basis (such as  deductions  for  depreciation  or
amortization)  shall be apportioned on a time basis and (ii) such  determination
shall  be  consistent  with  the  principles  of  Treasury   Regulation  Section
1.1502-76.  Company  will  furnish Tax  information  to Seller for  inclusion in
Seller's federal  consolidated Income Tax Return in accordance with the parties'
past custom and practice,  and Purchaser  will provide (or cause to be provided)
to Seller no later  than 120 days  prior to the due date  (with  extensions)  of
Seller's Tax Return for the taxable year  including the Closing all  information
and calculations  relating to the proper  determination of the income of Company
for such period.  If, within 60 days of Seller's receipt of such information and
calculations,   Seller  does  not  object  to  Purchaser's  determination,   the
determination  shall  be  final  and  shall be used by  Seller,  Purchaser,  and
Company. If Seller objects in writing to such determination within such 60 days,
Purchaser  and Seller shall  negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute.  If
Seller and Purchaser shall not have agreed to the proper determination within 10
days after Seller's  objection,  any disputed aspects of the determination shall
be resolved by a mutually  agreeable "big four" public accounting firm that does
not  serve  either  Seller  or  Purchaser  (the  "Independent  Firm") as soon as
practicable,  but in no event  later  than 20 days  prior to the due date  (with
extensions) of Seller's Tax Return.  The decision of the Independent  Firm shall
be final,  and the costs,  expenses,  and fees of the Independent  Firm shall be
borne equally by Seller and  Purchaser.  Neither  Seller nor Purchaser (or their
respective   affiliates)   shall  file  any  Income  Tax  Return  prior  to,  or


                                       34

inconsistent  with,  the  determination  of the proper income of Company for the
pre-Closing period pursuant to this Section 14.1(a).

                           (b)   Seller additionally  shall  prepare or cause to
be prepared  (at its own cost and expense and in a manner  consistent  with past
practice)  all Tax Returns of,  including or relating to Company  required to be
filed on or before the Closing Date.  Seller shall, on a timely basis, file such
Tax Returns (or cause such Tax Returns to be filed) and pay the amounts shown as
due thereon (or cause such amounts to be paid) to the  appropriate  Governmental
Body.

                           (c)   Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared
(at its own cost and  expense)  all other Tax  Returns of Company  for all other
taxable periods and,  subject to Section  14.5(b),  pay the amounts shown as due
thereon to the appropriate  Governmental  Body. For any taxable period beginning
before and ending on or after the  Closing  Date,  the Taxes of Company  for the
period  ending on the Closing Date shall be  determined  by closing the books of
Company  as of the end of the  Closing  Date or by any other  reasonable  method
agreed to by Seller and Purchaser,  except that (i) exemptions,  allowances,  or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a time
basis, (ii) all property Taxes, guaranty fund assessments, or other Taxes (other
than  Income,  premium,  franchise,  or  similar  Taxes) as to which the lien or
assessment  date occurs on or before the Closing Date shall be attributed to the
pre-Closing  period and shall be the liability of Seller, and (iii) all property
Taxes,  guaranty fund assessments,  or other Taxes (other than Income,  premium,
franchise,  or similar  Taxes) as to which the lien or  assessment  date  occurs
after the Closing Date shall not be  attributed  to the  pre-Closing  period and
shall not be the liability of Seller.  The  determination of such Taxes shall be
made by following  procedures  consistent (to the extent possible) with those in
Section  14.1(a).  Any  dispute  between  Seller  and  Purchaser  regarding  the
computation  or  determination  of Taxes  under this  Section  14.1(c)  shall be
resolved by the Independent Firm in a manner consistent with Section 14.1(a).

                           (d)   Except as required by law,  no  position  shall
be taken on any Tax Return (including any amended Tax Return) filed by Seller or
Company on or after the date  hereof by or on behalf of  Company  for any period
ending on or before the Closing Date that would  adversely  affect  Purchaser or
Company  after the Closing  unless  Seller  shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless
Purchaser  from such adverse  effect,  provided that Seller and Company may take
positions  consistent  with their  historic  positions and past practices on Tax
matters. Except as required by law, no position shall be taken on any Tax Return
(including  any amended  Tax Return)  filed by  Purchaser  or Company  after the
Closing  Date by or on behalf of Company for any period  beginning  on or before
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date that would  adversely  affect
Seller unless  Purchaser  shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless  Seller from such
adverse  effect,   provided  that  Purchaser  and  Company  may  take  positions
consistent with Seller's and Company's  historic positions and past practices on
Tax matters.

Closing Date, but in any event within 30 days after any request,  and subject to
Section 14.1, Seller or Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation
and  shall  deliver  such   information  and  data  concerning  the  pre-Closing
operations of Company and make available such knowledgeable  employees as Seller
or Purchaser may reasonably  request,  including  providing the  information and


                                       35

data  required  by  Seller's  or   Purchaser's   customary  Tax  and  accounting
questionnaires,  in order to enable Seller or Purchaser to complete and file all
Tax Returns  which they may be required to file with  respect to the  operations
and business of Company  through the Closing Date or to respond to audits by any
taxing  authorities  with  respect to such  operations  and  otherwise to enable
Seller or  Purchaser  to  satisfy  their  internal  accounting,  Tax,  and other
legitimate requirements.  Such cooperation and information shall include without
limitation  provisions  of powers of  attorney  for the  purpose of signing  Tax
Returns and  defending  audits and  promptly  forwarding  copies of  appropriate
notices and forms of other  communications  received  from or sent to any taxing
authority  which  relate  to  Company,  and  providing  copies  of all  relevant
documents  relating to rulings or other  determinations  by any taxing authority
and records  concerning  the ownership and Tax basis of property,  which Seller,
Purchaser or Company,  may possess,  but shall not require  Seller or any of its
affiliates  to  disclose  or  provide  copies  of Tax  Returns  or  accompanying
schedules and related workpapers (or portions thereof) except to the extent they
relate to Company.  Seller and Purchaser shall make their  respective  employees
and facilities  available on a mutually  convenient basis during normal business
hours to provide explanation of any documents or information provided hereunder.

                           (b)   Subject to Section  14.1,  Purchaser and Seller
shall  cooperate in the  preparation of all Tax Returns  relating in whole or in
part to Tax periods  ending on or before or including  the Closing Date that are
required to be filed after such date. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, furnishing such information within such party's possession requested
by the party filing such Tax Returns as is relevant to their preparation. In the
case of any state, local or foreign joint,  consolidated,  combined,  unitary or
similar Tax Returns, such cooperation shall also relate to any other Tax periods
in which one party could reasonably require the assistance of the other party in
obtaining  any  necessary  information,  but  shall  not  require  Seller or its
affiliates  to  disclose  or  provide  copies  of Tax  Returns  or  accompanying
schedules and related workpapers (or portions thereof) except to the extent they
relate to Company.

                  14.3   Records. For a period of ten (10)  years or, if longer,
                         -------
the  applicable  statute of  limitations  period  (including  any  extensions or
waivers  thereof)  after the  Closing  Date,  Purchaser  shall,  and shall cause
Company to,  retain all Tax  Returns,  and other  books and  records  (including
computer  files) of, or with respect to the  activities  of, Company for all Tax
periods or portions thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date.  Thereafter,
Purchaser  shall not dispose of any such Tax Returns,  books,  or records except
after providing  Seller with reasonable  notice and, if Seller so requests,  the
opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns,  books, or records solely at
Seller's cost and expense. Furthermore,  Purchaser agrees to abide by all record
retention  agreements  entered  into with any taxing  authority  with respect to
Company with  respect to books and records  applicable  to periods  prior to the
Closing Date.

                  14.4   Audits.  Seller  shall  have  the  right,  at  its  own

expense,  to control  any audit or  examination  by any taxing  authority  ("Tax
Audit"), to initiate any claim for refund, and to contest,  resolve,  and defend
against any assessment,  notice of deficiency,  or other  adjustment or proposed
adjustment  relating  to any and all Income  Taxes for any Tax period or portion
thereof  ending on or before the Closing Date.  Seller shall have the right,  at
its own  expense,  to control any Tax Audits,  to initiate any claim for refund,
and  to  contest,  resolve,  and  defend  against  any  assessment,   notice  of
deficiency,  or other adjustment or proposed  adjustment relating to any and all

Company.  Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in any
other Tax Audit or contest or defense of any  assessment,  notice of deficiency,
or other  adjustment  or proposed  adjustment  relating to Company to the extent
that Seller  would have any  obligation  to indemnify  Company or Purchaser  for
additional Taxes of Company or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

                  14.5   Indemnity.   If  Purchaser  fails  to  provide  any
                         ---------
information  reasonably  requested by Seller,  or if Seller fails to provide any
information  reasonably  requested by  Purchaser,  pursuant to Sections 14.2 and
14.3, or if either Purchaser or Seller breaches any covenant in this Article 14,
then   Purchaser  or  Seller,   as  the  case  may  be,   shall  be   obligated,
notwithstanding  any other provision of this  Agreement,  to indemnify the other
party and shall so indemnify the other party and its  respective  affiliates and
hold the other party and its respective affiliates harmless from and against any
and all costs, claims or damages,  including,  without limitation,  all Taxes or
deficiencies  thereof,  payable as a result of such  failure  or breach.  Seller
shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and Company harmless from:

                         (a)   any Tax Liability imposed on Company as a  member
of the  affiliated  group of  corporations  of which Seller is the parent and of
which Company is a member arising under Treasury Regulation  1.1502-6(a) (or any
similar provision of any other provision of state, local, or foreign law); and

                         (b)   any Tax Liability  of or with  respect to Company
for any taxable  year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, for
any taxable  year or period  beginning  on or before the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date,  for the portion of such Tax Liability that is allocable
under  Section 14.1 to the portion of such year or period  ending on the Closing
Date.

                  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in this Article 14,
Seller  shall have no  liability  to  Purchaser  or Company for any Taxes to the
extent of any reserves or accruals for such Taxes on the Balance Sheet.

                  14.6  Purchase  Price  Allocation.  Notwithstanding  Article 2
                        ---------------------------
hereof, for Tax purposes $300,000 of the Purchase Price will be allocated to the
Covenant  Not to  Compete  and  the  remainder  of the  Purchase  Price  will be
allocated to the Purchased Shares  following the transfers  described in Section
3.1 (the "Share Purchase Price").

                  14.7   Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller and Purchaser shall
                         ---------------------------
join in  making  an  election  under  Section  338(h)(10)  of the Code  (and any
corresponding  election  under state,  local or foreign tax law) with respect to
the purchase and sale of the stock of Company  hereunder (a "Section  338(h)(10)
Election").

                         (a)   With respect to Company, Seller,  Purchaser,  and
Company  shall  execute  any  documents,  statements,  and other  forms that are
required to be submitted to any taxing  authority in  connection  with a Section
338 Election  (the  "Section 338 Forms") no later than 15 days prior to the date
such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. Seller,  Purchaser, and Company
shall cause the Section 338 Forms to be duly  executed by an  authorized  person
for Seller, Purchaser, or Company, as the case may be, and shall duly and timely
file the Section 338 Forms in accordance  with applicable Tax laws and the terms
of this Agreement.  Seller and Purchaser shall report the purchase of the shares
of stock of Company  consistent  with the Section 338 Election and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless and to the extent required to do so pursuant to
applicable law.

                         (b)   Seller  and  Purchaser  agree,   as  soon  as
practicable  after the Closing Date, but no later than 60 days after the Closing
Date, to enter into an agreement  (the  "Allocation  Agreement") to allocate the
Share  Purchase  Price and the  liabilities  of Company to the assets of Company
pursuant to the Section 338 Election for all applicable Tax purposes,  including
the computation of the Aggregate  Deemed Sale Price (as defined under applicable
Treasury  Regulations  under the Code and similar state or local tax provisions)
("ADSP") for the assets of Company.  (The amount of the  liabilities  taken into
account for this purpose  shall,  in the case of any insurance  liabilities,  be
equal to Company's  corresponding  Tax  reserves,  and, in the case of any other
liabilities, be equal to the amount of Company's liabilities that would properly
be taken into  account in tax basis  under  general  principles  of tax law that
would  apply  upon  an   acquisition  of  the  assets  of  Company  (other  than
insurance-in-force)   for   consideration   that  included   discharge  of  such
liabilities.) The determination and allocation of ADSP (and the treatment of any
deemed reinsurance  transaction stemming from the Section 338 Election) shall be
made in accordance  with Section 338(b) of the Code and any applicable  Treasury
Regulations  and,  except to the extent  required by applicable law, in a manner
consistent with Proposed Treasury  Regulations  Section 1.338-11 and all related
Proposed  Treasury  Regulations.  Purchaser  initially shall prepare a statement
setting forth a proposed  computation and allocation of ADSP (the "Computation")
and shall  submit the  Computation  to Seller,  along with copies of  applicable
supporting  documents  used to prepare  the  Computation,  no later than 30 days
after  the  Closing  Date.  If,  within  30  days  of  Seller's  receipt  of the
Computation,  Seller shall not have objected in writing to the Computation,  the
Computation shall become the Allocation Agreement.  If Seller objects in writing
to the Computation within such 30 days,  Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve the  Computation,  and if so  resolved,  such  Computation
shall become the  Allocation  Agreement.  If Purchaser and Seller shall not have
agreed to the  Computation  and adopted an Allocation  Agreement  within 30 days
after Seller's  objection,  Seller and Purchaser  shall appoint the  Independent
Firm to resolve any disputed aspects of the Allocation  Agreement or Computation
within 35 days of Seller's  objection.  The  Independent  Firm shall resolve any
disputed  aspects  of  the  Allocation  Agreement  or  Computation  as  soon  as
practicable  but in no event  later than 30 days prior to the earlier of (i) the
last date on which the  Section 338 Forms must be filed or (ii) the last date on
which either  Purchaser or Seller  (whichever is earlier) must file a Tax Return
relating  to  the  transactions   contemplated   herein.  The  decision  of  the
Independent  Firm  shall be  final,  and the  costs,  expenses,  and fees of the
Independent  Firm shall be borne  equally by  Purchaser  and Seller.  Seller and
Purchaser (i) shall be bound by such  allocation for purposes of determining any
Taxes,  (ii) shall  prepare and file all Tax Returns to be filed with any taxing
authority in a manner consistent with such allocation,  and (iii) shall not take
a position  before any  taxing  authority  or  otherwise  (including  in any Tax
Return)  inconsistent  with the  Allocation  Agreement  unless and to the extent
required to do so pursuant to applicable law. In the event any taxing  authority
disputes the Allocation  Agreement,  the party receiving  notice of such dispute
shall promptly notify the other party of such dispute,  and Seller and Purchaser
shall  cooperate  in good  faith in  responding  to such  challenge  in order to
preserve the effectiveness of such allocation.

                  14.8   Transfer and Similar Taxes. All Transfer  Taxes arising
                         --------------------------
out of, in connection with or attributable to the transactions effected pursuant
to this Agreement shall be borne and paid by Purchaser.  Purchaser shall prepare

Transfer Taxes and timely pay the Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Returns.  For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay all Income
Taxes relating to the sale of the Purchased Shares.

amounts  credited  against  Taxes that relate to any  taxable  period of Company
ending after the Closing  Date shall be for the account of Purchaser  and Seller
shall pay over the amount of such refund or credit  within 30 days after receipt
or entitlement thereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a refund
or credit  pertaining  to a taxable  year or period  beginning  on or before and
ending after the Closing,  such refund or credit  shall be  apportioned  between
Seller and Purchaser based on the Tax allocation provided in Section 14.1.

                  14.10   Tax Sharing  Arrangement.  Any Tax Sharing Arrangement
                          ------------------------
shall be terminated  effective as of the Closing Date.

                  14.11  Conflicts.  In the  event of a  conflict  between  this
                         ---------
Article 14 and Article 13 (including any claim for  indemnification  relating to
Taxes  that  could be made under both this  Article  14 and  Article  13),  this
Article 14 shall govern and control.

                  15.6   Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto will use

commercially reasonable,  good faith efforts (a) to furnish upon request to each
other such  further  information,  (b) to execute and deliver to each other such

efforts to ensure  satisfaction  of the  conditions  precedent  to each  party's
obligations hereunder. Neither of the parties hereto will, without prior written
consent of the other party,  take any action which would  reasonably be expected
to  prevent  or  materially  impede,  interfere  with or delay the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  From time to time on or after the Closing Date,
Seller will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Purchaser
as  Purchaser  may  reasonably  request  in  order to more  effectively  vest in
Purchaser, Seller's title to the Purchased Shares and the Agway, Inc. Assets.

                  15.7     Books and Records.
                           -----------------

                           (a)  Unless otherwise  agreed  to  by  the   parties
hereto,  at the  Closing all books and records of the Company  shall be  located
in the Company's offices or, with respect to books and records  located in  off-
site storage  facilities,  shall,  within ninety (90) days following Closing, be
transferred at Purchaser's sole expense to an account established in the name of
Purchaser  and/or  the  Company,  whether  at the same  location  or such  other
location  as may be  identified  by  Purchaser  (all  such  books  and  records,
regardless of location,  referred to collectively as the "Transferred  Books and
Records").  To the extent that any Transferred Books and Records relating to the
operation of the businesses of the Company prior to Closing are expected in good
faith to be reasonably  required by Seller following Closing for purposes of the
preparation  or  examination  of  Tax  Returns,  regulatory  filings,  financial


                                       41
<PAGE>

statements,  the conduct of any litigation or regulatory  dispute  resolution or
relating to  obligations  arising under this  Agreement,  Seller may, at its own
expense, make and retain copies of any such Transferred Books and Records.

                           (b)   Following  the Closing  Date,  and for a period
of 10 years from the Closing Date,  Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, (i) allow Seller,  upon reasonable  prior notice and during regular business
hours,  through  its  employees  and  representatives,  the right,  at  Seller's
expense, to examine and make copies of the Transferred Books and Records for any
reasonable business purpose, and (ii) maintain the Transferred Books and Records
for  Seller's  examination  and  copying.  Access to the  Transferred  Books and
Records shall be at Seller's  expense and may not  unreasonably  interfere  with
Purchaser's or the Company's or any successor company's business operations.

                  15.8   Waiver. The rights and  remedies of the parties to this
                         ------
Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.  Neither the failure nor any delay
by any party in exercising any right,  power,  or privilege under this Agreement
or the documents  referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right,
power,  or privilege will preclude any other or further  exercise of such right,
power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.

                  15.9   Entire Agreement  and   Modification.   This  Agreement
                         ------------------------------------
supersedes  all  prior   negotiations,   understandings,   representations   and
agreements  between  the  parties  with  respect  to  its  subject  matter,  and
constitutes  a complete and  exclusive  statement of the terms of the  agreement
between  the  parties.  This  Agreement  may not be amended  except by a written
agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

                  15.10   Assignments, Successors,  and No  Third-Party  Rights.
                          -----------------------------------------------------
Neither  party may assign any of its rights  under this  Agreement  without  the
prior consent of the other party except that Purchaser may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned  subsidiary of Purchaser so
long as Purchaser  remains  liable for the  performance  of all  obligations  of
Purchaser  under  this  Agreement.  Subject  to  the  preceding  sentence,  this
Agreement  will  apply to, be  binding in all  respects  upon,  and inure to the
benefit  of  the  successors  and  permitted  assigns  of the  parties.  Nothing
expressed or referred to in this  Agreement will be construed to give any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable  right,  remedy,
or claim  under or with  respect  to this  Agreement  or any  provision  of this
Agreement.  This  Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the
sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors
and assigns.

                  15.11   Severability.  If  any  provision of this Agreement is
                          ------------
held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction,  the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision
of this  Agreement  held  invalid or  unenforceable  only in part or degree will
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

                  15.12   Section  Headings,  Construction.  The  headings  of
                          --------------------------------
Articles and Sections in this  Agreement are provided for  convenience  only and

provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms.

                          ----------------
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

                  15.14    Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and

         name,  mark or indication  of origin  derived  therefrom  including any
         abbreviations  thereof),  except to the  limited  extent the  Purchaser
         acquires  an express  license to use such  names,  trademarks  or other
         indications of origin pursuant to the License Agreement;

                  (j)     all rights to, or claims available to or being pursued
         by the Seller for, refunds of or credits against  Taxes  (including all

                  (l)     all prepaid expenses or deposits associated  with  any

                  (n)     all records  and  reports  maintained  by  the  Seller
         pertaining   exclusively   to  other   Excluded   Assets   or  Excluded
         Liabilities.

         1.1.2    (a)     Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
as an attempt to agree to assign any Assigned  Contract which is  non-assignable
without the consent of any other party  thereto,  unless such consent shall have
been given. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents necessary to effect such assignment, effective as
of the Closing,  prior to the Closing,  it being  understood that the failure to
obtain such  consents  shall not reduce the Purchase  Price or relieve any party
from its obligation to consummate at the Closing the  transactions  contemplated
by this  Agreement.  To the  extent  they are  unsuccessful  in  obtaining  such
consents by Closing,  the Seller and the Purchaser  shall continue their efforts
to obtain such consent(s) after the Closing,  and pending the ultimate obtaining
of such  approvals,  or if such approvals are  impossible to obtain,  the Seller
shall take all such commercially reasonable action as may be necessary or proper
in order to enable the Seller and the  Purchaser to arrange for  performance  by
the Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.1.2(b).  Notwithstanding  anything to
the contrary in this Agreement,  nothing in this Section 1.1.2 shall require the
Seller or the Purchaser to expend any material  sum,  make a material  financial
commitment  or grant or agree to any material  concession to any third Person to
obtain any such consent.

                  (b)     To  the  extent that any such consents and waivers are
not obtained,  or until the  impediments to such  assignment  are resolved,  the
Seller  shall  use all  reasonable  efforts  (without  the  expenditure,  in the
aggregate, of any material sum) to the extent permitted by Law to (i) provide to
the  Purchaser,  at the  request  of the  Purchaser,  the  benefits  of any such


                                       4
<PAGE>

Assigned Contracts, (ii) cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to provide
such benefits to the Purchaser and (iii) enforce,  at the request of and for the
account  of the  Purchaser,  any  rights  of the  Seller  arising  from any such
Assigned  Contracts  against any third  Person  including  the right to elect to
terminate in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of the Purchaser.
To the extent that the  Purchaser is provided the  benefits  (including  payment
rights) of any Assigned Contracts referred to herein (whether from the Seller or
otherwise),  (i) the Purchaser shall perform for the benefit of any third Person
the obligations of the Seller  thereunder or in connection  therewith,  and (ii)
the Purchaser  agrees to pay,  perform and discharge,  and,  pursuant to Section
11.3,  indemnify  the Seller  against  and hold the Seller  harmless  from,  all
obligations  and  liabilities  of the Seller  relating  to such  performance  or
failure to perform, and in the event of a failure of such indemnity,  the Seller
shall cease to be  obligated  under this  Agreement  in respect of the  Assigned
Contracts which are the subject of such failure.

         1.1.3    Promptly after the execution of this  Agreement and continuing
until the Closing Date,  representatives  of the Seller and the Purchaser  shall
jointly review, applying a reasonable analysis of applicable credit factors, the
accounts  receivable  that relate  exclusively  to the Business but that are not
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the  definition of "Assigned  Receivables."
Each such  account  receivable  as to which  the  parties  agree,  based on such
review,  that such  account  receivable  does not entail a  substantial  risk of
uncollectibility shall constitute an Assigned Receivable and shall be identified
as such on a schedule signed at the Closing Date by such  representatives.  Each
such account receivable as to which the parties disagree,  based on such review,
whether such account receivable  entails a substantial risk of  uncollectibility
shall  constitute an Assigned  Receivable  but shall also  constitute a Puttable
Receivable and shall be identified as such on a separate  schedule signed at the
Closing Date by such representatives.

         1.2.    Assumed Liabilities.  At  the  Closing,  except as described in
                 -------------------
this Section 1.2, the Purchaser shall assume and agree to pay, satisfy,  perform
and  discharge  as the same  shall  become due (i) all  accounts  payable to the
extent they relate to the Business and are listed on a schedule  prepared by the
Seller and  delivered to the Purchaser  prior to the Closing Date,  and (ii) all
liabilities  resulting  from or arising out of the  operation of the Business by
the Purchaser,  or the Purchaser's  ownership,  operation or use of the Acquired
Assets,  or the actions or omissions of the Purchaser,  its Affiliates,  agents,
contractors or  subcontractors in connection  therewith,  following the Closing,
including but not limited to liabilities  under Assigned  Contracts and the Real
Estate  Leases,  in each case  arising  after  the  Closing  Date (the  "Assumed
Liabilities"),  pursuant to an Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1.2 hereto.

         Notwithstanding  anything  contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Purchaser  shall not assume or otherwise be  responsible at any time for any
liability,  obligation,  debt or  commitment of the Seller,  including,  but not
limited to, any  liabilities,  obligations,  debts or  commitments of the Seller
incident to,  arising out of or incurred with respect to this  Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated hereby,  other than the Assumed Liabilities.  Without
limiting  the  foregoing,  the  following  liabilities  shall be retained by the
Seller (the "Excluded Liabilities"):

         (a)    any liability of the Seller for Income Taxes attributable to the
         Business or the Acquired Assets for Pre-Closing Tax Periods,  including
         (A) any liability  for Income Taxes of the Seller  pursuant to Treasury
         Regulation  ss.1.1502-6(a) or any comparable  provision of state, local


                                       5
<PAGE>

         or  foreign  law and (B)  Income  Taxes  resulting  from  the  sale and
         transfer from the Seller to the Purchaser of the Acquired Assets; and

         (b)    all liabilities in  respect  of any  claim,  lawsuit,  action or
         proceeding  to the extent such  claim,  lawsuit,  action or  proceeding
         directly pertains to any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability.

         1.3.   Method  of  Conveyance.  The  sale,  transfer,   conveyance  and
                ----------------------
assignment  by the Seller of the Acquired  Assets to the Purchaser in accordance
with  Section 1.1 hereof shall be effected on the Closing Date at the Closing by
the Seller's  execution and delivery to the Purchaser of instruments of transfer
including:  (a) special  warranty  deeds to the Real Property in the form of the
special  warranty deed attached hereto as Exhibit 1.3(a),  (b) a bill of sale in
the form  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  1.3(b)  (the  "Bill of  Sale"),  (c) an
assignment of the Seller's leases included in the Acquired Assets in the form of
Exhibit  1.3(c)  attached  hereto  (the  "Assignment  of Lease"),  (d)  transfer
documents  for  the  certificates  of  title  for all of the  Seller's  vehicles
included in the Acquired  Assets,  and (e)  assignments  of  trademarks  for the
trademarks included in the Acquired Assets. At the Closing,  all of the Acquired
Assets shall be transferred by the Seller to the Purchaser free and clear of any
and all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

         1.4    Purchase Price.  In  consideration  for  the  conveyance  of the
                --------------
Acquired Assets and in reliance on the representations and warranties, covenants
and  agreements of the Seller  contained  herein and the documents  contemplated
hereby, the Purchaser agrees to assume the Assumed  Liabilities and shall pay to
the Seller at Closing an amount equal to the sum of $8,500,000  plus the Closing
Date Net Current Asset Value,  or if the Closing Date Net Current Asset Value is
negative,  minus the absolute  value of the Closing Date Net Current Asset Value
(such  amount,  plus or minus any  adjustments  pursuant  to  Section  1.6,  the
"Purchase Price").

         1.5    Current Asset Valuation.  (a)  During  the two days prior to the
                -----------------------
Closing Date,  representatives  of the Seller and the Purchaser  shall conduct a
physical count of the inventory  included in the Acquired Assets for purposes of
determining the quantities and types thereof,  and shall use their  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  complete  and  agree  upon such  determination  and the
calculation  of the Closing  Date  Inventory  Value  prior to the Closing  Date.
Unless  they are  unable to reach such  agreement,  such  representatives  shall
jointly sign a certificate  setting forth such agreed valuation,  which shall be
final and  binding on, and shall be  nonappealable  by, the parties and shall be
the Closing Date Inventory Value for all purposes of this Agreement. If they are
unable to reach such  agreement  prior to the Closing  Date,  the  Closing  Date
Inventory  Value  shall be deemed to be the amount  equal to (i) 90% of the book
value of all  inventory of the Business as set forth on the balance sheet of the
Business, prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the most recent month-end prior
to the Closing Date minus (ii) $118,000,  solely for purposes of determining the
amount of Purchase  Price to be paid at Closing,  and the  provisions of Section
1.6(a)  through (c) shall apply for purposes of  determining  the final  Closing
Date Inventory Value.

                (b)    During   the   two   days  prior  to  the  Closing  Date,
representatives  of the  Seller and the  Purchaser  shall  review  the  accounts
receivable  included in the Acquired Assets and the accounts payable included in
the Assumed Liabilities,  and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
complete and agree upon the Closing Date Receivables  Value and the Closing Date


                                       6
<PAGE>

Payables  Value.   Unless  they  are  unable  to  reach  such  agreement,   such
representatives  shall  jointly  sign a  certificate  setting  forth such agreed
valuation,  which shall be final and binding on, and shall be nonappealable  by,
the parties and shall be the Closing Date Receivables Value and the Closing Date
Payables Value,  respectively,  subject to the provisions of Section 1.6(d).  If
such  representatives  are unable to reach such agreement as to the Closing Date
Receivables  Value prior to the Closing Date, the Closing Date Receivables Value
shall be deemed to be the book value of the accounts  receivable of the Business
described in Section  1.1(c) as set forth on the balance  sheet of the Business,
prepared in accordance  with GAAP as of the most recent  month-end  prior to the
Closing Date, solely for purposes of determining the amount of Purchase Price to
be paid at Closing, and the provisions of Section 1.6(a) through (c) shall apply
for purposes of determining  the final Closing Date  Receivables  Value. If such
representatives  are  unable to reach  such  agreement  as to the  Closing  Date
Payables  Value prior to the Closing Date, the Closing Date Payables Value shall
be deemed to be the book value of the  accounts  payable of the  Business as set
forth on the balance sheet of the Business,  prepared in accordance with GAAP as
of the most recent  month-end prior to the Closing Date,  solely for purposes of

         1.6      Purchase Price Adjustments.
                  --------------------------

                  (a)   Post-Closing   Purchase   Price   Adjustment.   If   the
representatives of the parties are unable to agree on the Closing Date Inventory
Value, the Closing Date Receivables  Value or the Closing Date Payables Value in
accordance  with Section 1.5,  then,  as soon as  practicable  but no later than
fifteen (15) business days after the Closing Date,  the Purchaser  shall prepare
and deliver to the Seller a balance  sheet which shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied  consistently with the preparation of the Financial Statements
(the  "Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet") and a  calculation  of the  Closing  Date
Inventory Value, the Closing Date Receivables Value or the Closing Date Payables
Value (whichever items are in dispute) and a calculation of the Closing Date Net
Current Asset Value,  in each case, as of the opening of business on the Closing
Date.  The Seller  shall have the right to dispute the  calculation  of any such
disputed item and make any proposed  adjustments  thereto as provided in Section
1.6(b).

                           (i)  If  it  is  determined  there is a Current Asset
                  Value Shortfall, the difference shall be paid to the Purchaser
                  on the Settlement Date; or

                           (ii) If it is  determined  there is a  Current  Asset
                  Value Surplus,  the difference  shall be paid to the Seller on
                  the Settlement Date.

                           (iii) In the event a Current Asset Value Shortfall is
                  not paid to the Purchaser on the  Settlement  Date (unless due
                  to the fault of the  Purchaser),  the Seller shall also pay to
                  the  Purchaser  interest  on the amount of the  Current  Asset
                  Value  Shortfall  at a rate of nine  percent  (9%) per  annum,
                  which  shall  accrue from the  Settlement  Date to the date of
                  actual payment.  In the event a Current Asset Value Surplus is
                  not paid to the Seller on the  Settlement  Date (unless due to


                                       7
<PAGE>

                  the fault of the Seller),  the Purchaser shall also pay to the
                  Seller  interest  on the  amount of the  Current  Asset  Value
                  Surplus at a rate of nine percent (9%) per annum,  which shall
                  accrue from the Settlement Date to the date of actual payment.

                  (b)    Dispute  Resolution  Procedures. The  Seller shall have
until  fifteen (15) business days after the delivery of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and accompanying  calculations to review such calculations and propose any
adjustments  thereto. All adjustments proposed by the Seller shall be set out in
detail  in a written  statement  delivered  to the  Purchaser  (the  "Adjustment
Statement")  and shall be  incorporated  into the Closing Date Net Current Asset
Value calculation, unless the Purchaser shall object in writing to such proposed
adjustments  (the  proposed  adjustment  or  adjustments  to which the Purchaser
objects  are  referred  to  herein  as  the  "Contested   Adjustments"  and  the
Purchaser's  objection notice is referred to herein as the "Contested Adjustment
Notice")  within  fifteen  (15)  business  days of delivery by the Seller to the
Purchaser of the  Adjustment  Statement.  If the Purchaser  delivers a Contested
Adjustment  Notice  to the  Seller,  the  Purchaser  and the  Seller  shall  use
reasonable efforts to resolve their dispute regarding the Contested Adjustments,
but if a final resolution thereof is not obtained within ten (10) days after the
Purchaser delivers to the Seller said Contested Adjustment Notice, the Purchaser
and the  Seller  shall  promptly  retain  a  nationally  recognized  independent
accounting   firm   acceptable  to  both  the  Seller  and  the  Purchaser  (the
"Independent  Accountant")  to resolve any  remaining  disputes  concerning  the
Contested  Adjustments.  Either  the  Seller or the  Purchaser  may  retain  the
Independent Accountant upon the expiration of such ten-day period.

                  If the Independent Accountant is retained, then (i) the Seller
and the Purchaser shall each submit to the Independent Accountant in writing not
later than fifteen (15) days after the Independent  Accountant is retained their
respective  positions with respect to the Contested  Adjustments,  together with
such  supporting  documentation  as they deem  necessary  or as the  Independent
Accountant  requests,  and (ii) the Independent  Accountant shall, within thirty
(30) days after receiving the positions of both the Seller and the Purchaser and
all  supplementary   supporting   documentation  requested  by  the  Independent
Accountant, render its decision as to the Contested Adjustments,  which decision
shall be final  and  binding  on,  and  nonappealable  by,  the  Seller  and the
Purchaser.  The fees and expenses of the Independent  Accountant shall be shared
equally  by the  Seller  and the  Purchaser.  The  decision  of the  Independent
Accountant  shall  also  include a  certificate  of the  Independent  Accountant
setting forth the final  calculation of the Closing Date Net Current Asset Value
(the  "Settlement  Amount  Certificate"),  which shall  include all  adjustments
proposed  by the Seller not  disputed  by the  Purchaser  and those  adjustments
accepted or made by the decision of the Independent  Accountant in resolving the
Contested Adjustments.

                  (c)     There   shall   be   a  "Settlement  Date"   after the
calculation of  the  Closing Date  Net Current Asset Value  which shall mean the
following,  as applicable:

                           (i)    If the Seller  has  not  timely  delivered  an
                  Adjustment Statement to the Purchaser,  twenty (20) days after
                  the date the Seller  receives  the  Closing  Date Net  Current
                  Asset Value calculation;

                                       8
<PAGE>

                           (ii)   If  the  Seller   has   timely   delivered  an
                  Adjustment   Statement  and   the  Purchaser  has  not  timely
                  delivered a Contested Adjustment Notice, twenty (20)days after
                  the  date the Purchaser receives the Adjustment Statement;

                           (iii)  If the  Seller  and  the  Purchaser  have  any
                  disputes  regarding  Contested  Adjustments  and they  resolve
                  those disputes, five business days after such resolution;

                           (iv)   Five  business  days  after  the   Independent
                  Accountant  delivers  the  Settlement  Amount  Certificate, if
                  applicable; or

                           (v)    Such other date as shall be agreed between the
                  Seller and the Purchaser.

                 (d)     Real  and  personal  property  Taxes  relating  to  the
Acquired  Assets,  utility charges, rentals  and similar charges relating to the
Business  that  are  unpaid  as  of  the  Closing  Date  and  that  cover or are
attributable  to  periods  that straddle the  Closing  Date,  including  but not
limited  to any such  charges  that are reflected   on invoices  received  after
the Closing Date and that were not taken into account in the  calculation of the
Closing Date Payables  Value pursuant to Section 1.5, shall be pro rated between
the parties on a per diem basis as of the Closing  Date,  and the parties  shall
make such  payments  to one  another as shall be  appropriate  to  reflect  such
proration  or, to the extent such amounts are  determined  prior to the Closing,
shall be adjustments reflected on the closing statement.  Any dispute under this
provision  shall be resolved by the  Independent  Accountant  within thirty (30)
days of the submission of such dispute.

         2.8      Title and Related Matters.
                  -------------------------

                  (a)   The  Seller  has  good  and  marketable  title  to  all
Acquired  Assets,  free and clear of all Liens,  except (i) Permitted  Liens and
(ii) the Senior Lender Liens.  Section 2.8(b) of the Disclosure  Schedule hereto

ordinances  and zoning  ordinances and all Laws.  The  Improvements  are in good
operating  condition  and  repair,  ordinary  wear  and tear  excepted,  and are
adequate and suitable for the purposes for which they are presently  being used.
The real  property  included  in the  Acquired  Assets  and its  continued  use,
occupancy  and  operation as  currently  used,  occupied  and operated  does not
constitute  a  nonconforming  use  under  any Law or  Order  affecting  the real
property  (other than  possible set back  violations,  none of which will have a
Material  Adverse  Effect or the continued  use,  occupancy and operation of the
real property  included in the Acquired Assets as currently  used,  occupied and
operated),  and the continued  existence,  use,  occupancy and operation of each
Improvement,   and  the  right  and  ability  to  repair  and/or   rebuild  such

         2.9   Litigation.  There  is no Claim pending or, to the best Knowledge
               ----------
of the Seller,  threatened  against the Seller which,  if adversely  determined,
would have a Material  Adverse  Effect on the  Business,  nor is there any Order
outstanding  against the Seller having,  or which,  insofar as can be reasonably
foreseen, in the future may have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.

         2.10   Tax Matters. The Seller has filed on a timely basis all material
                -----------
Tax Returns  that were  required to be filed with respect to the Business or the
Acquired  Assets pursuant to applicable law, and all such Tax Returns were true,
correct and  complete in all  material  respects.  The Seller has paid,  or made
provision  for the payment of, all material  Taxes that have become due pursuant
to those Tax Returns and that are  attributable  to the Seller,  the Business or
the Acquired Assets.

         2.11   Compliance with Law and Applicable Government Laws. The Business
                --------------------------------------------------
has not been, and is not being, operated in material violation of all applicable
Laws and applicable Orders,  including, but not limited to, all Laws relating to
the  safe  conduct  of  business,  quality  and  labeling,  antitrust,  consumer
protection, equal opportunity, discrimination, health, sanitation, fire, zoning,
building  and  occupational  safety.  There  are no  Claims  pending,  or to the
Knowledge  of the Seller  threatened,  nor has the Seller  received  any written
notice, regarding any violations of any Laws or Orders enforced by any Authority


                                       12

claiming  jurisdiction  over the Seller  including any requirement of OSHA. This
Section  shall  not  apply  to  Tax  matters,   employee   benefit   matters  or
environmental  matters, which are instead the subject of Sections 2.10, 2.12 and
2.14, respectively.

         2.12     ERISA and Related Matters.
                  -------------------------

         (a)   Section 2.12(a) of the Disclosure  Schedule  contains  a complete
and accurate  list of  all the  Seller Plans and other benefit obligations  with
respect to the Business.

         (b)   The Seller has made available to the Purchaser:

               (i)    all documents that set forth the terms of each Seller Plan
or  other  benefit  obligation  and of any  related  trust,  including  (A) plan
descriptions  and  summary  plan  descriptions  of Plans for which the Seller is
required  to  prepare  and  distribute  plan   descriptions   and  summary  plan
descriptions,  and (B) summaries and descriptions  furnished to participants and
beneficiaries  regarding  plans or other  benefit  obligations  for which a plan
description or summary plan description is not required;

               (ii)   the most  recent  actuarial  report  with  respect  to any
Seller Title IV Plan;

               (iii)  the  Form 5500 filed  for the most  recent  Plan year with
respect to each Seller Plan, including all schedules thereto and the opinions of
independent accountants; and

               (iv)   with   respect   to  Pension  Plans,   the   most   recent
determination  letter for each Plan of the Seller.

         (c)   (i)    Each  Seller  Plan  intended  to be  qualified  under Code
Section 401(a) has or has applied for a current favorable  determination  letter
from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that the Plan is so qualified, none
of such Plans has been subject to any  assertion by any  governmental  Authority
that it is not qualified, and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation
of any such Plan  which is  reasonably  likely to cause  the  imposition  of any
material  liability  against the Business or the Purchaser  under ERISA or other
applicable  laws other than the Code. With respect to all other Seller Plans and
other benefits  obligations  with respect to the Business,  nothing has occurred
which is reasonably  likely to cause the  imposition  of any material  liability
against the Business or the Purchaser under ERISA, the Code, or other applicable
laws. Without limiting the foregoing:

                        (A)    No  transaction  prohibited  by ERISA Section 406
                 and no "prohibited transaction" under Code Section 4975(c) have
                 occurred  with  respect  to  any Seller Plan that is reasonably
                 likely to result in a  material  liability  to the  Business or
                 the Purchaser.

                         (B)   All contributions  required with respect   to any
                 Seller  Plan  have been paid to the  applicable  Seller Plan or
                 trust when  due, and the Seller has no liability to the Pension
                 Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any Plan.

                (a)  With  respect to each Business  Employee who is employed in
connection with the Business  immediately before the Closing Date, including any
employee who is absent from work by reason of  vacation,  the  Purchaser  agrees
that as of and  immediately  after the Closing Date, the Purchaser  shall employ
such Business Employee in a position that is reasonably  comparable to that held
with the Seller as disclosed to the Purchaser in the Data Book Information dated
July  2002 and that  does not  result in a  significant  change in  compensation
(excluding any retention or other bonus plan  payments) or work  location.  With
respect to each Business Employee who is absent from work on the Closing Date by
reason  of  approved  leave  of  absence,  short-term  disability,  or  workers'
compensation,  the  Purchaser  agrees that when each such  Business  Employee is
available to return to work, fit for duty, within one (1) year after the Closing
Date the Purchaser  shall offer to employ such  Business  Employee in a position
that is  reasonably  comparable to that held with the Seller as disclosed to the
Purchaser in the Data Book Information  dated July 2002 and that does not result
in a significant change in compensation  (excluding any retention or other bonus
plan payments) or work location. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller and be responsible for any Claims made by any Business  Employees for
severance or other benefits based on separation,  for any Claims based on breach

employment,  or the  suspension or  termination of employment of, any employees,
other than any claims related to the Seller's actions before the Closing Date or
based solely on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                (b)   On and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser  shall credit
to each Business  Employee the service of such employee with the Seller  through
the Closing  Date to the same extent as if such service had been  performed  for
the  Purchaser  (i)  for  all  purposes  in  connection  with  determining  such
employee's  eligibility for and vesting in all Plans, programs, and arrangements
for which such employee is otherwise eligible,  including but not limited to, as
applicable, the Purchaser's Pension Plan, 401(k) Plan, severance, and sick days,
and (ii) for purposes of determining the amount of such employee's benefit under
the Purchaser's severance plan. For purposes of the Purchaser's vacation policy,
the Purchaser  shall credit each Business  Employee with no less than the number
of years of service  necessary to ensure that (i) each Business Employee has the
same number of annual  vacation  days for 2002 (taking into account days used by
each  Business  Employee  while  employed by the Seller)  under the  Purchaser's
vacation policy as under the Seller's  vacation  policy,  and (ii) each Business
Employee does not require a greater number of years of service to reach the next
higher  increment of vacation days under the  Purchaser's  vacation  policy than
would have been required under the Seller's vacation policy.  Vacation earned by
Business  Employees  in 2001 to be taken in 2002,  and which is unused as of the
Closing Date,  shall be assumed by the Purchaser  provided  that: (i) the Seller
shall pay the Purchaser an amount equal to the value of such unused  vacation on
the Closing  Date,  and (ii) the Purchaser  shall pay any Business  Employee who
terminates  employment  with Purchaser in 2002 for any reason an amount equal to
the value of such Business  Employee's  unused  vacation for 2002. The Purchaser


                                       20
<PAGE>

shall have no  obligation  to pay to any Business  Employees any of the value of
any  vacation  accrued  in 2002  that  is not  available  for use in that  year.
Furthermore,  the  Purchaser  shall  waive or cause to be waived,  except to the
extent  such  waiver is  prohibited  by  applicable  Law,  any  waiting  period,
probationary period, pre-existing condition exclusion,  evidence of insurability
requirement,  or similar condition with respect to initial  participation  under
any Plan,  program,  or arrangement of the Purchaser to provide health coverage,
life insurance,  disability  benefits,  or other similar  welfare  benefits with
respect to each Business Employee who has satisfied the comparable  requirements
under the Seller's comparable Plans before the Closing Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Business Employees employed by the Purchaser
shall not be eligible for medical  benefits with the Purchaser  until October 1,
2002.  On and after the Closing Date and until  September  30, 2002,  the Seller
shall continue to provide medical  coverage under the Agway Inc.  Medical/Dental
Plan to Business Employees who were participating in such plan as of the Closing
Date.

                (c)   Except as otherwise  specifically provided in this Section

         (a)    The  Seller  and  the  Purchaser  agree  to  use   commercially
reasonable efforts  to enter  into an  agreement  (the  "Allocation  Agreement")
as soon as  practicable  (but in any  event no later  than  150 days  after  the

other  capitalizable  costs among the Acquired Assets and the Seller's agreement
under Section 4.7 for all applicable Tax purposes,  including Code Section 1060.
The  Purchaser  shall  initially  prepare a statement  setting  forth a proposed
computation and allocation of the aggregate purchase price (the  "Computation"),
and submit it to the Seller no later than 60 days after the  Closing  Date.  If,
within 30 days of the Seller's receipt of the Computation,  the Seller shall not
have objected in writing to such  Computation,  the Computation shall become the
Allocation  Agreement.  If such objection shall be made within such period,  and
within 60 days after the Seller's  receipt of the Computation the Seller and the
Purchaser have not adopted an Allocation Agreement,  any disputed aspects of the
Allocation Agreement shall be resolved within 90 days of the Seller's receipt of
the Computation by the Independent Accountant,  which shall resolve such dispute
pursuant to, first, the terms of this Agreement and, second,  the application of
applicable Tax laws to the relevant facts.

                                       22
<PAGE>

         (b)  After the Closing, from time to time, the Purchaser and the Seller
shall  agree  upon  revisions  to  the  Allocation   Agreement  to  reflect  any
adjustments  to the  consideration.  The Purchaser and the Seller shall file and
cause to be filed all Tax  Returns and execute  such other  documents  as may be
required by any Taxing  Authority,  in a manner  consistent  with the Allocation
Agreement,  as it may be revised  from time to time.  The Seller  shall  prepare
Internal  Revenue  Service Form 8594 (or any  successor  form)  pursuant to Code
Section 1060 relating to the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement based
on the Allocation Agreement, as it may be revised from time to time, and deliver
such form to the  Purchaser.  The  Purchaser and the Seller shall file, or cause
the filing of,  such form and each  comparable  form with each  relevant  Taxing
Authority. Any dispute under this provision shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountant within 30 days of the submission of such dispute.

         (c)   Irrespective of Article  XI or any other  provision  hereof,  the
Purchaser  shall bear and be liable for, and shall indemnify the Seller against,

indemnify the  Purchaser  against  abstracting  and title  insurance  commitment
costs, all transfer,  documentary,  registration,  stamp,  value-added and other
similar Taxes  (including  all  applicable  real estate  transfer Taxes and real
property gains Taxes), incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making and filing
all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of any Tax laws
applicable  to the transfer of the Acquired  Assets,  and each of the Seller and
the Purchaser shall timely pay any Taxes for which it is responsible  under this
Section 6.5(c) or, in the case of any such Taxes paid by the other party hereto,
timely  indemnify  such other party  against such Taxes.  Any dispute under this
provision shall be resolved by the Independent  Accountant within 30 days of the
submission of such dispute.

         (d)   At the Closing, the Seller shall  deliver to the  Purchaser  duly
executed certificates  certifying that the transactions  contemplated hereby are
exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

         (e)   The Seller shall timely  file or cause to be filed (i) the United
States consolidated  federal income Tax Returns of the Seller and (ii) all other
Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired  Assets or the income or  operations of
the Business  required to be filed (including any extensions) on or prior to the
Closing Date or with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Seller shall pay
or cause to be paid all Taxes due on or with  respect to such Tax Returns or the
taxable periods or events covered  thereby.  The Purchaser shall prepare all Tax
Returns with respect to the Acquired  Assets or the income and operations of the
Business due after the Closing Date except for Tax Returns due with respect to a
Pre-Closing  Tax  Period;  provided  that if such Tax  Returns  cover a Straddle
Period and the Seller is liable for any Taxes  shown as due on such Tax  Returns
pursuant to the terms of this Section  6.5(e),  the Purchaser  shall submit such
Tax  Returns to the Seller for review and comment no later than thirty (30) days
prior  to the  date  such  Tax  Returns  are  required  to be  filed  (including
extensions).  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  in Section  1.2,  the
Purchaser shall timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Except to
the extent paid or adjusted on the closing statement pursuant to Section 1.6(d),
the Seller  shall remit to the  Purchaser at least two (2) days prior to the due


                                       23

date of any Tax Returns relating to any Straddle Period relating to the Acquired
Assets its pro rata  share  (calculated  on a per diem  basis as of the  Closing
Date) of any Taxes  shown as due on such Tax  Returns.  Any  dispute  under this
provision shall be resolved by the Independent  Accountant within 30 days of the
submission of such dispute.

         (f)   The  Seller  and  the Purchaser shall each provide the other with
such  assistance  as may be reasonably  requested  (including  making  employees
reasonably available to provide information or testimony) in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return or the  determination  of liability for Taxes with
respect to the Acquired  Assets or the income or operations of the Business,  in
each case as contemplated by this Agreement.

         (g)   Any decision of the Independent Accountant under this Section 6.5
shall be final, and the costs,  expenses and fees of the Independent  Accountant
shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser.

         (h)   The obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall

each other and their respective  accountants,  counsel and other representatives

pertinent to the Business), personnel and assistance relating to the Business as
is reasonably  necessary for financial  reporting and  accounting  matters,  the
preparation  and  filing of any  returns,  reports or forms or the  defense  of,
prosecution of, or response required under, or pursuant to, any lawsuit,  action

to the  Acquired  Assets) or in order to enable the parties to comply or monitor
compliance (including with respect to Purchaser's  obligations in respect of the
Assumed Liabilities) with their respective obligations under this Agreement. The
Purchaser  and the Seller  shall also  furnish or cause to be  furnished to each
other and  their  respective  accountants,  counsel  and  other  representatives
access,  during  normal  business  hours,  to such  information  for  any  other
reasonable business purpose.

                (a)   For  a  period of 180 days  after the  Closing  Date,  the
Purchaser shall assist the Seller,  without  charge,  in the  collection  of all
Excluded Receivables,  and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to  collect
all Puttable Receivables,  provided that in either case the Purchaser  shall not
be required to initiate any legal proceedings or incur any  expenses for outside

outstanding  invoice  to that  customer,  unless (i) the  customer  specifically
directs  application  to a different  invoice or (ii) the  customer is disputing
such oldest  invoice and  application of the payment to the oldest invoice would
be inconsistent with the position of the customer in such dispute. The Purchaser
will hold for the Seller all  collections  received by it in respect of Excluded


                                       24

Purchaser  may,  by  notice to the Seller,  require the Seller to repurchase the
uncollected  portion of all Puttable  Receivables  at a purchase price equal the

Section 11.2 or Section  11.3 of notice of the  commencement  of any  Proceeding
against it, such  Indemnified  Person will,  if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying party under such Section,  give notice to the indemnifying party of
the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified   Person,   except  to  the  extent  that  the  indemnifying   party
demonstrates  that the defense of such action is prejudiced  by the  Indemnified
Person's failure to give such notice.

                  (b)  If any  Proceeding  referred  to in  Section  11.8(a)  is
brought  against an Indemnified  Person and it gives notice to the  indemnifying
party of the  commencement  of such  Proceeding,  the  indemnifying  party will,
unless the claim involves  Taxes,  be entitled to participate in such Proceeding
and (unless the  indemnifying  party is also a party to such  Proceeding and the
Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint  representation  would be
inappropriate),  to assume the defense of such Proceeding. After notice from the
indemnifying  party to the  Indemnified  Person of its  election  to assume  the
defense of such  Proceeding,  the  indemnifying  party  will not,  as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this
Article XI for any fees of other  counsel or any other  expenses with respect to
the  defense  of such  Proceeding,  in each case  subsequently  incurred  by the
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Proceeding,  (i) it will be  conclusively  established for purposes of this
Agreement  that the claims made in that  Proceeding  are within the scope of and
subject to indemnification;  (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may
be effected by the indemnifying  party without the Indemnified  Person's consent
unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any Law or Order
or any  violation  of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims
that  may be made  against  the  Indemnified  Person,  and (B) the  sole  relief
provided is monetary  damages that are paid in full by the  indemnifying  party;
and (iii) the  Indemnified  Person will have no  liability  with  respect to any
compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent.  If notice
is given to an indemnifying  party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the
indemnifying  party does not,  within ten days  after the  Indemnified  Person's
notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume
the  defense of such  Proceeding,  the  indemnifying  party will be bound by any
determination made in such Proceeding;  provided,  however, that the Indemnified


                                       30
<PAGE>

Person may not, without the written consent of the indemnifying  party,  consent
to any compromise or settlement of the Proceeding.
