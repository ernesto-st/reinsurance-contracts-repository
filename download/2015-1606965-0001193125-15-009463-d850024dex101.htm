withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not property executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative
Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already
been reimbursed by the Loan Parties pursuant to <U>Sections&nbsp;2.12</U> and <U>2.15</U> and without limiting any obligation of the Loan Parties to do so pursuant to such Sections) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and
