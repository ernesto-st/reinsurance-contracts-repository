<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Bank other than a Conduit Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("<U>Participants</U>") participating interests in any RFC Loans owing to such Bank, any Notes held by such Bank, and/or any other interests of such Bank hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Notes for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Company, RFC and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents. The Company agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Notes are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of offset in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and any Notes to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement or any Notes, <U>provided</U> that such right of offset shall be subject to the obligation of such Participant to share with the Banks, and the Banks agree to share with such Participant, as provided in subsection 9.7. The Company also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Eurodollar Loans outstanding from time to time; <U>provided</U> that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such subsections than the transferor Bank would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Bank to such Participant had no such transfer occurred. No Participant shall be entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of or to this Agreement or any Note, unless the same is subject to clause (a) of the proviso to subsection 9.1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Bank other than a Conduit Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to any Bank or any Lender Affiliate thereof, and, with the consent of the Company (unless an Event of Default is continuing), RFC and the Agent (which in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld) to one or more additional banks or financial institutions ("<U>Purchasing Banks</U>") all or any part of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement and the Notes pursuant to a Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or a Lender Affiliate, and subject to the other qualifiers above, by the Company and RFC) and agreement by such Purchasing Banks to be bound by the terms of this agreement including without limitation the provisions of subsection 9.15 hereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (i) each such sale shall be accompanied by a corresponding simultaneous assignment of such selling Bank's pro rata share to the Purchasing Bank of (x) its Commitment by taking such action as set forth in subsection 4.5(a) of the Liquidity Agreement and (y) its Tranche B Commitment (as defined in the 364-Day Facility) pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.6(d) of the 364-Day Facility and (ii) the Purchasing Bank shall be an Eligible Assignee (as defined in the Liquidity Agreement). Upon (i) such execution of such Transfer Supplement, (ii) delivery of an executed copy thereof to the Company and RFC, (iii) compliance with the assignment procedures under subsection 4.5(a) of the Liquidity Agreement and (iv) payment, if any, by such Purchasing Bank, such Purchasing Bank shall for all purposes be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto. Such Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting adjustment of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Bank under this Agreement and the Notes. Upon the consummation of any transfer to a Purchasing Bank, pursuant to this subsection 9.6(c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Company shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Bank and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchasing Bank, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their interests or, as appropriate, their outstanding RFC Loans as adjusted pursuant to such Transfer Supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Bank hereunder with the consent of RFC, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but without the consent of the Company or the Agent any or all of the RFC Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this subsection 9.6(c); <U>provided</U>, that such designating Bank affirms its obligations pursuant to subsection 9.15.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in subsection 9.2 (a) copy of Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "<U>Register</U>") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the RFC Loans owing to, RFC and to each Bank from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Company, the Agent, RFC and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the RFC Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, RFC or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its receipt of a Transfer Supplement executed by a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or an affiliate thereof, by the Company, RFC and the Agent) together with payment to the Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Transfer Supplement (ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to RFC, the Banks and the Company.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant or Purchasing Bank (each, a "<U>Transferee</U>") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company which has been delivered to such Bank by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank by the Company in connection with such Bank's credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering into this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;If, pursuant to this subsection 9.6, any interest in this Agreement or any Note is transferred to a Non-U.S. Bank, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer to comply with the provisions of subsection 2.14.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this subsection 9.6 concerning assignments relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including any pledge or assignment by a Bank to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the Company, each Bank and the Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; <U>provided</U>, however, that each Bank designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section is intended to modify the requirements contained in the Liquidity Agreement for replacement, addition or participation of Banks thereto. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;RFC may, without the consent of any party, assign the RFC Loans at any time to a Liquidity Institution pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Agreement.</P>

<P>Pricing will be determined based upon the lower of the ratings from S&amp;P or Moody's, but in the event the Company's ratings are more than one Level apart, the pricing will be determined by using the rating which is one Level above the lower rating; <U>provided</U>, that (i) if on any day the ratings from S&amp;P or Moody's are not at the same Level, then the Level applicable to the lower of such ratings shall be applicable for such day, (ii) if on any day the rating of only one of S&amp;P or Moody's is available, then the Level of such rating shall be applicable for such day and (iii) if on any day a rating is available from neither of S&amp;P or Moody's, then Level 5 shall be applicable for such day. Any change in the applicable Level resulting from a change in the rating of a S&amp;P or Moody's shall become effective on the date such change is publicly announced by S&amp;P or Moody's, as applicable.</P></BODY>
