thereto, but call to your attention the absence of any applicable case law concerning the

legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability of the governing law provisions of

based on an obligation denominated in another currency, any judgments or decrees must be

that: (i)&nbsp;in the case of proceeds, the Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest is limited as
provided in Sections&nbsp;9-315 and 9-322 of the NYUCC; and (ii)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;552 of the Bankruptcy
Code limits (subject to the exceptions set forth therein) the extent to which property
acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code may be
subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by the debtor
before the commencement of such case.

place of business or chief executive office, as applicable, for ILFC Ireland and ILFC
Bermuda, is not located in a jurisdiction whose law generally requires information
concerning the existence of a nonpossessory security interest to be made generally available
in a filing, recording or registration system as a condition or result of the security
interest&#146;s obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the
collateral.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(s) In the case of Collateral in which the security interest of the Collateral Agent
has been perfected by the filing of a Financing Statement, Article&nbsp;9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code requires the filing of continuation statements within the period of six
months prior to the expiration of five years from the date of the original filings in order
to maintain the effectiveness of such filings.

any Collateral acquired by a US Obligor more than four months after such US Obligor so
changes its name as to make the Financing Statement filed in respect of such US Obligor
seriously misleading, unless an amendment to such Financing Statement indicating the new
name of the relevant entity is properly filed before the expiration of such four months.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(u) If any US Obligor changes its jurisdiction of organization to a new jurisdiction,
the Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest in certain of the Collateral will terminate four
months after such change (or, if earlier, when perfection would have ceased under the law of
the former jurisdiction), unless such security interest is perfected in such new
jurisdiction before termination.
