failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other
Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that
no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any
Loan required to be made by such other

                                                                              21


Lender). The Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in (i) an aggregate
principal amount which is (or the Assigned Dollar Value of which is) not less
than $1,000,000 and, except in the case of Alternative Currency Borrowing, an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 or (ii) an aggregate principal amount equal to
the remaining balance of the available Commitments (or the Alternative Currency
Equivalent thereof in the case of an Alternative Currency Borrowing).

            (b) Each Term Borrowing and each Revolving Borrowing denominated in
Dollars shall be comprised entirely of Eurocurrency Loans or ABR Loans, as the
Borrowers may request pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04, as applicable. Each
Revolving Borrowing denominated in the Alternate Currency shall be comprised
entirely of Eurocurrency Revolving Loans. Each Lender may at its option make any
Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; PROVIDED that any exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type
may be outstanding at the same time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that none of the
Borrowers shall be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would
result in an aggregate of more than twelve separate Borrowings being outstanding
hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having
different Interest Periods or denominated in different currencies, regardless of
whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

            (c) Subject to Section 2.05, each Lender shall make each Loan to be
made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer to such
account as the Administrative Agent may designate in federal funds (in the case
of any Loan denominated in Dollars) or such other immediately available funds as
may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in
Sterling not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, in the case of
fundings to an account in New York City, or 11:00 a.m., local time, in the case
of fundings to an account in another jurisdiction, and the Administrative Agent
shall by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of fundings to an account in
New York City, or 12:00 (noon), local time, in the case of fundings to an
account in another jurisdiction, credit the amounts so received to an account
designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, which
account must be in the country of the currency of the Loan (it being understood
that the funding may be for the credit of an account outside such country) or,
if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent
herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the
respective Lenders. Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with Section 2.16. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with this paragraph (c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount in the required currency. If the Administrative Agent shall
have so made funds available then to the extent that such Lender shall not have
made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the
applicable Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon in
such currency, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the
applicable Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative
Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the
time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight
or short-term funds in the relevant currency (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute
such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
Borrower shall be entitled to request any Borrowing if the Interest Period
requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.

            SECTION 2.03. LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, any Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in the Alternative Currency for its
own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof and until
the earlier of the Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitments in
accordance with the terms hereof. In the event of any inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the applicable
Borrower to, or entered into by the applicable Borrower with, the Issuing Bank
relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall control. Letters of Credit will be issued solely to support obligations
owed to persons that are Lenders as of the respective date of issuance of such
Letters of Credit.

            (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, EXTENSION; CERTAIN
CONDITIONS. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing
Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on
which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c)
of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the
Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request
for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each
Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC
Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000; (ii) the aggregate Revolving Exposures
shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments; and (iii)
the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Term Loans and the
aggregate Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in
effect.

            (c) EXPIRATION DATE. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

            (d) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender
hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable
Revolving Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section,
or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable
Revolving Borrower

<Page>
                                                                              23


for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be
made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

            (e) REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on
the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received
notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such
date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such
time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i)
the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of
receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the
applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior
to such time on the day of receipt. If the applicable Borrower fails to make
such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the
applicable Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Revolving Percentage
thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Percentage of the payment then due
from the applicable Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c)
with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section
2.02(c) shall apply, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, to the payment obligations of the
Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly
following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have
made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to
such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Revolving Loan and
shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

            (f) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The applicable Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
affiliates, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes

<Page>
                                                                              24


beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be
construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower
to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims
in respect of which are hereby waived by such Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by the Issuing
Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The
parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or
wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have
exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and
without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to
documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance
with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

            (g) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank
has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower
of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.

            (h) INTERIM INTEREST. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount
thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower
reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
Loans; PROVIDED that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC
Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section
2.09 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the
account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date
of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to
the extent of such payment.

            (i) REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING BANK. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among Holdings, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement
of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective,
the applicable Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the
replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.06. From and after the effective
date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the
rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                                                                              25


            (j) CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Lenders with LC Exposures
representing a majority in amount of the total LC Exposure demanding the deposit
of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Borrower shall
deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders, an amount in
cash equal to the total LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon; PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral
shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately
due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (l) or
(m) of Article VII. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent
as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the
Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive
dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,
which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower's risk and expense, such
deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders
with LC Exposure representing a majority in amount of the total LC Exposure), be
applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If
any Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a
result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not
applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business
Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

            SECTION 2.04. BORROWING PROCEDURE. (a) In order to request a
Borrowing, the applicable Borrower shall give telephonic notice to the
Administrative Agent (confirmed by hand delivery or telecopy of a duly completed
Borrowing Request in the form of Exhibit A), (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency
Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, London time, three Business Days before a
proposed borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of a proposed borrowing. Such
notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case specify (i) in the case of a
Borrowing on the Effective Date, whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Term
Borrowing or a Revolving Borrowing, (ii) whether the Borrowing then being
requested is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing, (iii) the date
of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iv) the aggregate principal
amount of such Borrowing, (v) the currency of such Borrowing (which, in the case
of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, shall be Dollars) and (vi) if such Borrowing is
to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no
election as to the currency of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing is specified
in any Borrowing Request, then the applicable Revolving Borrower shall be deemed
to have requested a Revolving Borrowing in Dollars. If no election as to the
Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing
shall be an ABR Revolving Borrowing if denominated in Dollars or a Eurocurrency
Revolving Borrowing if denominated in the Alternative Currency. If no Interest
Period with respect to any Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing is specified, then
the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of
one month's duration.

            SECTION 2.05. INTEREST ELECTIONS. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall
be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or in the Funding
Memorandum referred to in the Effectiveness Agreement, as the case may be, and,
in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period
as specified in such Borrowing Request or in such Funding Memorandum.
Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type
or to continue such

<Page>
                                                                              26


Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest
Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

            (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.04 if the Borrower were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery of
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

            (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
            applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
            different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
            each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
            specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be
            specified for each resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
            Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
            Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing,
            the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
            such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the
            definition of the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

            (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

            (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be (i)
in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, converted to an ABR Borrowing
and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in the Alternative Currency,
converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default
is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be
converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

            SECTION 2.06. FEES. (a) Holdings agrees to pay to each Lender,
through the Administrative Agent, on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 31 and on the Revolving Maturity Date, a commitment fee (a "COMMITMENT
FEE") equal to 0.50% per annum on the daily average unused amount of the
Revolving Commitment of such Lender (whether or not the conditions set forth in
Section 4.01 shall have been satisfied), during the preceding quarter (or
shorter period commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Revolving
Maturity Date or any date on which the Revolving Commitment of such Lender shall
be terminated). All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to each
Lender shall commence to accrue on the date of this Agreement and shall cease to
accrue on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the date on which the
Revolving Commitment of such Lender shall have been terminated and the Loans of
such Lender shall have been repaid.

            (b) Holdings agrees to pay the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, such fees, and at such times, as have been separately agreed upon (the
"ADMINISTRATIVE FEES").

            (c) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as
applicable, among the Lenders (and, if applicable, to the Issuing Bank with
respect to Fees owed to it). Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable
except in the case of errors.

            (d) Holdings agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the rate of 3.00% per
annum, on the average daily amount of such Revolving Lender's LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the later
of the date on which such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and
the date on which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii)
to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per
annum separately agreed upon between Holdings and the Issuing Bank on the
average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the date hereof to but excluding the later of the date of termination
of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing
of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and
including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall
be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Effective Date; PROVIDED that all such fees
shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and
any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank
pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All
participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).

            SECTION 2.07. REPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) The outstanding principal
balance of each Term Loan shall be payable on the Term Maturity Date. The
outstanding principal balance of each Revolving Loan shall be payable on the
Revolving Maturity Date. Each Loan shall bear interest from the date of the
Borrowing of which such Loan is a part on the outstanding principal balance
thereof as set forth in Section 2.08.

                                                                              28


            (b) Each Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrowers to,
maintain, in accordance with its usual practice, records evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender hereunder from time to time,
including the date, amount, currency and Type of and the Interest Period
applicable to each Loan made by such Lender from time to time and the amounts of
principal and interest paid to such Lender from time to time in respect of each
such Loan.

            (c) The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section 2.07 and in the Register maintained by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 11.04(d) shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations of each Borrower to which such entries
relate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
Agent to maintain or to make any entry in such records or the Register, as
applicable, or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of any Borrower to repay any Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

            SECTION 2.08. INTEREST ON LOANS. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.09, the Eurocurrency Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing
shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to (i) the LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for the Borrowing of which such Loan is part
multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus (ii)(A) 3.00% per annum for
Eurocurrency Revolving Loans and (B) 3.00% per annum for Eurocurrency Term
Loans.

            (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, the Loans comprising
each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, when
determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all
other times) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus (i) 2.00%
per annum for ABR Revolving Loans and (ii) 2.00% per annum for ABR Term Loans.

            (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement. The applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate for each
Interest Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.09. DEFAULT INTEREST. If any Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration
or otherwise, such Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the
Administrative Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the Alternate
Base Rate plus 2% per annum (or, in the case of the principal of any Loan, if
higher, the rate of interest otherwise applicable, or most recently applicable,
to such Loan hereunder plus 2% per annum).

            SECTION 2.10. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of any Type the Administrative
Agent shall have determined that Dollar deposits or deposits in the Alternative
Currency in which such Borrowing is to be denominated in the principal amounts
of the Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the London
interbank market, or that the rates at which such deposits are being offered
will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or
maintaining its Eurocurrency Loan during such Interest Period, or that
reasonable means do

                                                                              29


not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telecopy notice of such
determination to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any
such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the
applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, any request by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Borrowing
of the affected Type or in the affected currency shall be deemed to be a request
for an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.11. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS; INCREASE OF
COMMITMENTS. (a) Unless previously terminated under this Agreement, (i) the Term
Commitments shall be automatically and permanently terminated at 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Effective Date and (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall
be automatically terminated at the Administrative Agent's close of business in
New York City on the Revolving Maturity Date.

            (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, Holdings (on behalf of all the
Borrowers) may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time
in part permanently reduce, the Commitments of any Class; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that (i) each partial reduction of a Commitment shall be in an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 and in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or if less, the
remaining Revolving Commitment or Term Commitment, as applicable, and (ii) no
such termination or reduction shall be made which would reduce the aggregate
Revolving Commitments to an amount less than the aggregate Revolving Exposures.

            (c) Each reduction in the Commitments of any Class hereunder shall
be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments. Holdings shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders, on the date of each termination or reduction, the Commitment Fees
on the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to but not
including the date of such termination or reduction.

            (d) Holdings may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent,
executed by Holdings and one or more financial institutions (any such financial
institution referred to in this Section being called an "INCREASING LENDER"),
which may include any Lender, cause Revolving Commitments to be extended or Term
Loans to be made by the Increasing Lenders (or cause the Revolving Commitments
or Term Loans of the Increasing Lenders to be increased, as the case may be) in
an amount for each Increasing Lender set forth in such notice, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (a) the aggregate amount of all new Revolving Commitments and
increases in existing Revolving Commitments and Term Loans and increases in
existing Term Loans pursuant to this paragraph during the term of this
Agreement, together with the Revolving Commitments and term Loans existing on
the Effective Date, shall in no event exceed $250,000,000, (b) each Increasing
Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of
the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
(c) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a
party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent
a duly executed accession agreement in a form satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and Holdings (an "ACCESSION AGREEMENT"). New Revolving Commitments and
Term Loans and increases in Revolving Commitments and term Loans pursuant to
this Section shall become effective on the date specified in the applicable
notices delivered pursuant to this Section. Upon the effectiveness of any
Accession Agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, (i) such
Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and
shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender
hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder and (ii) Schedule
2.01 shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the Revolving Commitment or
term Loans of such Increasing Lender as provided in such Accession Agreement.
Upon the effectiveness of any increase pursuant to this Section in the Revolving
Commitment or term Loan of a Lender already a party

<Page>
                                                                              30


hereto, Schedule 2.01 shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the
increased Revolving Commitment or Term Loan of such Lender. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no increase in the aggregate Revolving Commitments or Term Loans (or
in the Revolving Commitment or Term Loan of any Lender) shall become effective
under this Section unless, on the date of such increase, the Administrative
Agent shall have received a certificate, dated as of the effective date of such
increase and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company, to the effect that
the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 shall be
satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to
be references to such increase). Following any extension of a new Revolving
Commitment or increase of a Lender's Revolving Commitment pursuant to this
paragraph, any Revolving Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such
increase or extension shall continue outstanding until the ends of the
respective Interests Periods applicable thereto, and shall then be repaid or
refinanced with new Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

            SECTION 2.12. PREPAYMENT. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part,
upon giving written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed
by written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent: (i) in the case of
Eurocurrency Loans no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business
Days prior to prepayment and (ii) in the case of ABR Loans, no later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the prepayment; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount which is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.

            (b) On the date of any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.11, the Borrowers shall pay or prepay so much
of the Revolving Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate
Revolving Exposures will not exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments after
giving effect to such termination or reduction.

            (c) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Term Loans and the aggregate Revolving
Exposures exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers shall prepay Revolving
Borrowings and, after no further Revolving Borrowings shall be outstanding, Term
Borrowings, in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

            (d) Each notice of prepayment under this Section 2.12 shall specify
the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion
thereof) to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the applicable
Borrower to prepay such Borrowing (or portion thereof) by the amount stated
therein on the date stated therein. All prepayments under this Section 2.12
shall be subject to Section 2.15 but otherwise without premium or penalty.

            (e) Each prepayment under this Section shall be applied first
against the Lenders' Revolving Loans to the extent of the amount of such
Revolving Loans that shall be outstanding at the time of such prepayment.
Prepayments of the Term Loans may not be made until all Revolving Loans have
been prepaid and all Revolving Commitments have been terminated.

            SECTION 2.13. RESERVE REQUIREMENTS; CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement
any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender (or any
lending office of any Lender) or the Issuing Bank of the principal of or
interest on any Eurocurrency Loan made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein, or any Fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other
than changes in respect of

<Page>
                                                                              31


taxes imposed on the overall net income or capital stock of such Lender by the
jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority therein), or shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by such Lender (or
any lending office of such Lender) or the Issuing Bank, or shall impose on such
Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition
affecting this Agreement or any Eurocurrency Loan made by such Lender or any
Letter of Credit or participation therein, and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining
any Eurocurrency Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank
of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether
of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be
material, then Holdings shall (or shall cause the Borrowers to) pay to such
Lender or the Issuing Bank upon demand such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.

            (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have determined that any
change after the date hereof in the applicability of any law, rule, regulation
or guideline adopted pursuant to or arising out of the July 1988 report of the
Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of
such Lender) or any Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with any
request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force
of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans or Letters of
Credit or participations therein made by such Lender or the Issuing Bank
pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender, the Issuing Bank or
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for
such applicability, adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's and the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's
and the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material, then from time
to time Holdings shall (or shall cause the responsible Borrower to) pay to such
Lender or the Issuing Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

            (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth such
amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, shall be
delivered to Holdings and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Holdings
shall (or shall cause the responsible Borrower to) pay each Lender or the
Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it
within 10 days after the receipt of the same.

            (d) Except as provided below in this paragraph (d), failure on the
part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation for any increased
costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand compensation with respect to such
period or any other period. The protection of this Section shall be available to
each Lender and the Issuing Bank regardless of any possible contention of the
invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other
change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed. Neither the
Issuing Bank nor any Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section
2.13 for any costs incurred or reductions suffered with

<Page>
                                                                              32


respect to any date unless it shall have notified Holdings that it will demand
compensation for such costs or reductions not more than 90 days after the later
of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which it shall have become aware of such
costs or reductions.

            SECTION 2.14. CHANGE IN LEGALITY. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, if, after the date hereof, (i) any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loan or Alternative Currency
Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to
any Eurocurrency Loan or Alternative Currency Loan, or (ii) there shall have
occurred any change in national or international financial, political or
economic conditions (including the imposition of or any change in exchange
controls) or currency exchange rates which would make it impracticable for any
Lender to make Loans denominated in the Alternative Currency or to any Borrower,
then, by written notice to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender may:

            (i) declare that Eurocurrency Loans or Alternative Currency Loans
      (in the affected currency or to the affected Borrower), as the case may
      be, will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness or
      impracticability) be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request
      by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Borrowing or Alternative Currency
      Borrowing (in the affected currency or to the affected Borrower), as the
      case may be, shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR
      Loan or a Loan denominated in Dollars, as the case may be, unless such
      declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (or, if a Loan to the
      requesting Borrower cannot be made for the reasons specified above, such
      request shall be deemed to have been withdrawn); and

            (ii) require that all outstanding Eurocurrency Loans or Alternative
      Currency Loans (in the affected currency or to the affected Borrower), as
      the case may be, made by it be converted to ABR Loans or Loans denominated
      in Dollars, as the case may be, in which event all such Eurocurrency Loans
      or Alternative Currency Loans (in the affected currency or to the affected
      Borrower) shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans or Loans
      denominated in Dollars, as the case may be, as of the effective date of
      such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurocurrency Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as the case may be,
that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurocurrency Loans or
Alternative Currency Loans, as the case may be, of such Lender shall instead be
applied to repay the ABR Loans or Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may
be, made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such
Eurocurrency Loans or Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may be.

            (b) For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the Borrowers by
any Lender shall be effective as to each Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the
Interest Period currently applicable to such Loan; in all other cases such
notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrowers.

            SECTION 2.15. INDEMNITY. The Borrowers agree to indemnify each
Lender against any actual loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of (a) any failure by such Borrower to fulfill on the date of
any borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b)
any failure by such Borrower to borrow or to convert or continue any Loan
hereunder after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, conversion or continuation
has been given or deemed given pursuant to Section 2.04 or 2.05, (c) any
payment, prepayment, conversion or transfer of a Eurocurrency Loan required

<Page>
                                                                              33


by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a
date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any
default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part
thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due
date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of
prepayment or otherwise) or (e) the occurrence of any other Event of Default,
including, in each such case, any actual loss or reasonable expense sustained or
incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof
as a Eurocurrency Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its
cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted,
transferred or not borrowed (assumed to be the LIBO Rate) for the period from
the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion, transfer or failure to borrow
to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced
on the date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying
the funds so paid, prepaid, converted, transferred or not borrowed for such
period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender
setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.16. PRO RATA TREATMENT. (a) Except as required under
Section 2.11(d) or Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing, each payment or
prepayment of principal of any Revolving Borrowing, each payment of interest on
the Revolving Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each payment
constituting reimbursement of an LC Disbursement, each reduction of the
Revolving Commitments and each conversion or continuation of any Revolving
Borrowing with a Revolving Borrowing of any Type, shall be allocated pro rata
among the Revolving Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts
of their outstanding Revolving Loans. Each Revolving Lender agrees that in
computing such Revolving Lender's portion of any Revolving Borrowing to be made
hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Revolving
Lender's percentage of such Revolving Borrowing to the next higher or lower
whole Dollar (or comparable unit of the Alternative Currency) amount.

            (b) Except as required under Section 2.14, each Term Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of any Term Borrowing, each payment of
interest on the Term Loans, and each conversion or continuation of any Term
Borrowing with a Term Borrowing of any Type, shall be allocated pro rata among
the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Term Commitments or, if
such Term Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with
the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Term Loans.

            SECTION 2.17. SHARING OF SETOFFS. Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
against any Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title
11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in
lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means,
obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans or
reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement (other than pursuant
to and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) as a result of which
the unpaid principal portion of its Loans or LC Disbursements shall be
proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans or LC
Disbursements of any other Revolving or Term Lender, as applicable, it shall be
deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value,
and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a
participation in the Loans and LC Disbursements of such other Lender, so that
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements and

<Page>
                                                                              34


participations in the Loans and LC Disbursements held by each Lender shall be in
the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and LC
Disbursements then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans and LC
Disbursements prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or
other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and LC Disbursements
outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or
other event; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if any such purchase or purchases or
adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the payment giving
rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or
adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase
price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrowers expressly
consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any Lender holding a
participation in a Loan or LC Disbursement deemed to have been so purchased may
exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with
respect to any and all moneys owing by such Borrower to such Lender by reason
thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan or LC Disbursement directly
to such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            SECTION 2.18. PAYMENTS. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment
(including principal of or interest on any Borrowing, reimbursements of LC
Disbursements or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under each other Loan
Document, without setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 noon, local time
at the place of payment, on the date when due in immediately available funds.
Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at
270 Park Avenue, New York, New York. Each such payment (other than principal of
and interest on Alternative Currency Loans, which shall be made in the
Alternative Currency) shall be made in Dollars and each Alternative Currency
payment should be made at the offices of the Administrative Agent at 125 London
Wall, London, England EC2Y5AJ, or any other account that the Administrative
Agent may designate.

            (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing, reimbursements of LC Disbursements or any Fees or other amounts)
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would
occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

            SECTION 2.19. TAXES. (a) Each Borrower covenants and agrees that,
whether or not any Loans are made by the Lenders or Letters of Credit are issued
by the Issuing Bank hereunder:

            (i) all payments on account of the principal of and interest on the
      Loans, and all other amounts payable by each Borrower hereunder, to or for
      the account of the Lenders including, without limitation, amounts payable
      under clause (ii) of this Section 2.19(a), shall be made without any
      setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without reduction by
      reason of, all present and future income, stamp, documentary,
      registration, excise, property and other taxes and levies, deductions,
      charges, compulsory loans and withholdings whatsoever (other than income
      or franchise taxes imposed on the overall net income or capital stock of
      the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including any transferee or
      assignee thereof ("TRANSFEREE"), by the taxing authority of the
      jurisdiction in which the Agent or such Lender, as applicable, has its
      principal lending office or under the laws of which the Agent, the Issuing
      Bank or such Lender, as applicable, is organized) and all interest,
      penalties or similar amounts with respect thereto, now or hereafter
      imposed, assessed, levied or collected by any country or any political
      subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or by any federation or
      association of or with which any country may be a member or associated or
      by any jurisdiction from which any payment hereunder is made or any taxing
      authority thereof or therein, on or in respect of this Agreement, the
      recording, registration, notarization or other formalization of any
      thereof, the enforcement thereof or the

      introduction thereof in any judicial proceedings, or on or in respect of
      any payments of principal, interest, premiums, charges, fees or other
      amounts made on, under or in respect of any thereof (hereinafter called
      "TAXES"), all of which will be paid by the appropriate Borrower, for its
      own account, prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto;

            (ii) the Borrowers shall indemnify the Agent, the Issuing Bank and
      Lenders against, and reimburse the Agent, the Issuing Bank and Lenders (or
      Transferees) on demand for, any Taxes and any loss, liability, claim or
      expense arising therefrom or with respect thereto including interest,
      penalties and reasonable legal fees and disbursements, which the Agent or
      the Issuing Bank may incur, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or
      legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority. A certificate as to the
      amount of such Tax, loss, liability, claim or expense prepared by the
      Agent or the Issuing Bank, absent manifest error, shall be final,
      conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such indemnification shall be
      made within 30 days after the date the Agent or the Issuing Bank makes a
      written demand therefor;

            (iii) in the event that a Borrower is required by applicable law,
      decree or regulation to deduct or withhold Taxes from any amounts payable
      on, under or in respect to this Agreement, such Borrower shall pay to the
      Agent, the Issuing Bank or the applicable Lenders, as the case may be,
      such additional amount(s) as may be required, after the deduction or
      withholding of Taxes (including any deduction or withholding of Taxes with
      respect to such additional amounts), to enable the Agent, the Issuing Bank
      or such Lender to receive from such Borrower an amount equal to the amount
      stated to be payable by such Borrower to the Agent, the Issuing Bank or
      such Lender under this Agreement;

            (iv) each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the official tax
      receipts in respect of each payment of Taxes required under this Section
      2.19(a) within 30 days after the date such payment is due pursuant to
      applicable law, and each Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Bank, at
      the Agent's request, any other information, documents and receipts that
      the Agent may, from time to time, reasonably require to establish to its
      reasonable satisfaction that full and timely payment has been made of all
      Taxes required to be paid under this Section 2.19(a);

            (v) in the event that the payments by a Borrower become exempt from
      or not subject to Taxes, such Borrower will, upon the reasonable request
      of the Agent, furnish to the Agent either a certificate from each
      appropriate taxing authority or an opinion of counsel reasonably
      acceptable to the Agent, in either case stating that payments hereunder
      are exempt from or not subject to taxes; and

            (vi) if a Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing Bank or the Agent
      shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund in respect of
      Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower, or with respect
      to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this
      Section 2.19, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of the availability of
      such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the
      Borrower make a claim to the relevant taxing authority or other
      Governmental Authority for such refund at the Borrower's expense. If any
      Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing Bank or the Agent receives a refund
      (including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the preceding
      sentence) in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by
      the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional
      amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall promptly repay such refund
      (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts
      paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Taxes
      giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such

                                                                              36


      Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing Bank or the Agent to the Borrower,
      PROVIDED that the Borrower, upon the request of such Lender (or
      Transferee) or the Agent, agrees to return such refund (plus penalties,
      interest or other charges) to such Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing
      Bank or the Agent in the event such Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing
      Bank or the Agent is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing
      authority or other Governmental Authority.

            (vii) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction
      of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower
      is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
      respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to Holdings (with a
      copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
      applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
      prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Holdings as will
      permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate,
      provided that such Lender has received written notice from the Borrower
      advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and
      supplying all applicable documentation.

            (b) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations of each Borrower pursuant to
this Section 2.19 shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and
interest on the Loans.

            SECTION 2.20. ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
(a) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant
to Section 2.13 or Section 2.19 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with
legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested
by a Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if
the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the
amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and would not,
in the judgment of such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender (or Transferee).

            (b) In the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or
certificate pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.14, or a Borrower shall be required to
make additional payments to any Lender under Section 2.19, Holdings shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 11.04) all
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to another financial
institution approved by the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) which shall assume such obligations; PROVIDED that (i) no
such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority and (ii) the assignee shall pay to the affected Lender in
immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and
interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and a
Borrower shall pay to the affected Lender in immediately available funds on such
date all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder.

                   ARTICLE III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            Holdings and each Borrower represents and warrants that:

            SECTION 3.01. CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND GOOD STANDING. Holdings and
each of its Material Subsidiaries: (a) is a corporation, partnership or other
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization; (b) has all requisite corporate or other
power, and has all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals, necessary to own its assets and carry on its business as now being or
as proposed to be conducted; and (c) is qualified to do business and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification necessary and where failure so to qualify or to be
in good standing could reasonably be expected to (either individually or in the
aggregate) result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.02. CORPORATE POWER, AUTHORIZATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE
LAW. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrowers of this
Agreement and by Holdings and the Subsidiaries of the other Loan Documents to
which they are to be party are within their respective corporate powers, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and will not violate any
provision of law of or their articles of incorporation, by-laws or memoranda or
articles of association, or result in the breach of or constitute a default
under or require any consent under any indenture or other material agreement or
instrument to which Holdings or any Subsidiary is a party or by which Holdings
or any Subsidiary or its respective properties may be bound or affected, or
cause any of its properties to become subject to any Lien; this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower, and each
other Loan Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Holdings and each Subsidiary (to the extent Holdings or such Subsidiary is party
thereto) enforceable against such person in accordance with its terms.

            (b) The conduct by Holdings and its Subsidiaries of their respective
businesses as they are presently operated does not violate any material
provision of law or material rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority in
a manner which, when taken together with all other such violations, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Materially Adverse Effect; and Holdings
and its Subsidiaries have obtained all material consents and approvals of
Governmental Authorities required to conduct their respective businesses as they
are presently operated, except to the extent that failure to obtain any such
consents or approvals could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.03. FINANCIAL INFORMATION; ABSENCE OF MATERIAL ADVERSE
CHANGE. (a) The audited consolidated financial statements of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, certified by
independent public accountants selected by Holdings, fairly present the
financial condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries at the date of such
statements and the results of their respective operations for the fiscal year
ended on said date, all in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied.

            (b) The consolidating balance sheets by geographic region of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, were prepared by
management of Holdings in good faith.

            (c) Since December 31, 2000, there has occurred no Material Adverse
Change.

            SECTION 3.04. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Each of the Borrowers and its
ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder. No Reportable Event has occurred in respect

<Page>
                                                                              38


of any Plan of any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate. The present value of all
benefit liabilities of all underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to
fund each such Plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation dates applicable
thereto, exceed by more than $5,000,000 the value of the assets of all such
underfunded Plans. Neither the Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate have incurred
any Withdrawal Liability that materially adversely affects the financial
condition of any Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates taken as a whole. Neither the
Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate have received any notification that any
Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within the
meaning of Title IV of ERISA, and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected
to be in reorganization or to be terminated, where such reorganization or
termination has resulted or can reasonably be expected to result in an increase
in the contributions required to be made to such Plan that would materially and
adversely affect the financial condition of any Borrower and its ERISA
Affiliates taken as a whole.

            SECTION 3.05. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. The Borrowers are aware of no
events, conditions or circumstances involving environmental pollution or
contamination or employee health or safety that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change.

            SECTION 3.06. LITIGATION. There are no suits, investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened, against or
affecting Holdings or the Subsidiaries which call into question the validity of
this Agreement or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect (other than suits, investigations or proceedings referred to in the
definition of "Litigation Liabilities" to the extent no Default shall have
resulted therefrom under Section 6.08 or any other provision of this Agreement).

            SECTION 3.07. TAXES. Holdings and its Subsidiaries have filed all
Federal and other material tax returns required to be filed and paid all Federal
and other material taxes due or assessed indicated thereon, including interest
and penalties, except for taxes which are being contested in good faith and by
applicable proceedings, and for which Holdings and its Subsidiaries have made
adequate reserves on the books of Holdings and its Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 3.08. SUBSIDIARIES. Schedule 3.08, as the same shall be
updated by Holdings from time to time by means of one or more notices delivered
to the Administrative Agent, correctly sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of
Holdings, its jurisdiction of incorporation and the percentage of each class of
issued and outstanding capital stock owned by Holdings and any Subsidiary,
respectively, if any; the corporations listed on Schedule 3.08 are the only
Subsidiaries of Holdings as of the date of this Agreement.

            SECTION 3.09. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Neither Holdings nor any of
its Subsidiaries is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

            SECTION 3.10. NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. No information, report,
financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of any
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with this
Agreement or included herein or delivered pursuant hereto contained or contains
any material misstatement of fact or omitted or omits any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, or are made, not misleading.

            SECTION 3.11. FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. (a) Neither Holdings, nor
any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one if its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or

            (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether
directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, (i)
to purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose
of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness originally
incurred for such purpose, or (ii) for any purpose which entails a violation of,
or which is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of the Board,
including Regulation U or X.

            SECTION 3.12. TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Holdings and its Subsidiaries
have good title in fee simple to, or valid and subsisting leasehold interests
in, all their respective material real properties, and good title to all their
respective material other properties, reflected on the financial statements of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries referred to in Section 3.03 above, except for

properties or documents of title relating to such properties are subject to any
Liens except Liens permitted by Section 6.01.

            SECTION 3.13. USE OF PROCEEDS. The Borrowers will use the proceeds
of the Loans only for the purposes specified in the preamble to this Agreement.

            SECTION 3.14. SECURITY DOCUMENTS. (a) The Pledge Agreement is
effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent a legal, valid and
enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined therein), and

thereunder in and to such Collateral to the extent it can be perfected by
filings or such other actions under the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to
Liens existing on the date hereof and expressly permitted by Section 6.01.

            (c) The Trademark Security Agreement has been filed in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, and

interest of the grantors thereunder in the Intellectual Property (as defined in
the Security Agreement) that is registered in the United States.

            (d) The York Avenue and Chicago Mortgages are, and the other
Mortgages when executed and delivered will be effective to create in favor of
the Collateral Agent legal, valid and enforceable Liens on all right, title and
interest of the grantors thereunder in and to the Mortgaged Properties and the

other Mortgages when filed in the appropriate offices will constitute, perfected
first priority Liens on and security interests in all right, title and interest

                                                                              40


            (g) The Swiss securities mortgage is effective to create in favor of
the Collateral Agent a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the
pledged equity interests of the Swiss Borrower, and constitute a perfected first
priority Lien on and security interest in all right, title and interest of each

the exception of the Antitrust Settlement Agreement, have been approved by the
applicable courts pursuant to non-appealable orders and all amounts to become

then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued
Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall
automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrowers, anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding. Any
Letters of Credit issued to Lenders to support the obligations listed on
Schedule 1.01A hereto may be drawable on or after an Event of Default.

                            ARTICLE VIII. THE AGENTS

<Page>
                                                                              50


            In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, The Chase Manhattan Bank is hereby appointed to act as Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Agents to take such actions on behalf of such Lender
and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the Agents by the
terms and provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any
implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of
principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders
hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each
payment so received; (b) as provided in Article VII, to give notice on behalf of
each of the Lenders to the Borrowers of any Event of Default specified in this
Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in
connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender
copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by any
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

            Neither the Agents nor any of their directors, officers, employees
or agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of them
except for its or his own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, or be
responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents
of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or
to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrowers of
any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan
Document. The Agents shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the due
execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this
Agreement, or any other Loan Documents or other instruments or agreements. The
Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from
acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders
and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any
action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders. The
Agents shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely
on any instrument or document believed by them in good faith to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons. Neither
the Agents nor any of their directors, officers, employees or agents shall have
any responsibility to the Borrowers on account of the failure of or delay in
performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or to
any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any
other Lender or a Borrower of any of their respective obligations hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith. The Agents
may execute any and all duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents by
or through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of
legal counsel selected by them with respect to all matters arising hereunder and
shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by them in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

            The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agents shall be under no
duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by them pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless they shall be
requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at
any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrowers. Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York,
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an affiliate
of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become

<Page>
                                                                              51


vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

            With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, the Agents in their
individual capacity and not as Agents shall have the same rights and powers as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though they were not the Agents,
and the Agents and their affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if they were not the Agents.

            Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the
amount of its pro rata share (based on its outstanding Term Loans, Revolving
Exposures and unusued Commitments at the time of such demand) of any expenses
incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Agents, including counsel fees
and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of
the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by one of the Borrowers and
(b) to indemnify and hold harmless the Agents and any of their directors,
officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata share,
from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against them in their capacity as Agents or any of them in any way relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken
or omitted by any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to
the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrowers; PROVIDED
that no Lender shall be liable to the Agents for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Agents or any of their directors, officers, employees or
agents.

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed applicable, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
applicable, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                   ARTICLE IX. COLLECTION ALLOCATION MECHANISM

            (a) On the CAM Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments shall
automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Article VII
and (ii) the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to
have exchanged interests in the Specified Obligations and in each LC Reserve
Account established pursuant to paragraph (b) below such that, in lieu of the
interest of each Lender in the Specified Obligations owed to it as of such date
and, if such Lender shall be a Revolving Lender, such Lender's participation in
undrawn Letters of Credit, such Lender shall own an interest equal to such
Lender's CAM Percentage in each of the Specified Obligations outstanding
hereunder and in each such LC Reserve Account. Each Lender, each person
acquiring a participation from any Lender as contemplated by Section 11.08 and
each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange. Each Borrower and
each Lender agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent all such

<Page>
                                                                              52


promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent
shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests and
obligations of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each
Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in
connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery
of any promissory notes so executed and delivered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
failure of any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any
such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or
effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.

            (b) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit
shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any amount drawn under
a Letter of Credit shall not have been reimbursed either by the Borrowers or
with the proceeds of a Revolving Borrowing, each Revolving Lender which shall,
on such date and before giving effect to the CAM Exchange, have held a
participation in such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.03(d) shall
promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds,
an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Percentage of such undrawn face
amount or such unreimbursed drawing, as the case may be. The Administrative
Agent shall establish a separate account (each, an "LC RESERVE ACCOUNT") for
each Lender with respect to each such Letter of Credit for the amounts received
in respect of such Letter of Credit from each Revolving Lender paying such
amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence. Each Lender's LC Reserve Account or
Accounts, collectively, shall initially include cash in an amount equal to the
product of (x) such Lender's CAM Percentage and (y) the total amount received
from the Revolving Lenders pursuant to the second preceding sentence after
giving effect to the CAM Exchange. The Administrative Agent shall have dominion
and control over each such account, and the amounts deposited in each LC Reserve
Account shall be held in such LC Reserve Account until withdrawn as provided in
paragraph (c), (d), (e) or (f) below. The Administrative Agent shall maintain
records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and deposited in
the LC Reserve Accounts in respect to each Letter of Credit and the amounts on
deposit in such LC Reserve Accounts. The amounts paid by a Revolving Lender to
the Administrative Agent pursuant to this paragraph shall be held as a reserve
against the LC Exposures, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not
constitute Loans to any Borrower and shall not give rise to any obligation on
the part of any Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that
the Borrowers' reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall
arise only at such times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section
2.03.

            (c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall
be made in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall, at the
request of the Issuing Bank, withdraw from the LC Reserve Account of each of the
Lenders (in accordance with each Lender's CAM Percentage) any amounts, up to the
amount of such drawing, deposited in respect of such Letter of Credit and
remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts to the Issuing Bank in
satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Lenders under Section
2.03(d) (but not of the Borrowers under Section 2.03).

            (d) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of
Credit shall expire undrawn, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the LC
Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in
respect of such Letter of Credit and distribute such amount to such Lender.

            (e) With the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent and
the Issuing Bank (not to be unreasonably withheld), any Lender may withdraw the
amount held in its LC Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any
Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally
obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter
of Credit, to pay over to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Issuing Bank, on demand, its CAM

<Page>
                                                                              53


Percentage of such drawing. In the event any Lender shall default on its
obligation to pay over any amount to the Administrative Agent in respect of any
Letter of Credit as provided in this Article IX, the Issuing Bank shall, in the
event of a drawing thereunder, have a claim against such Lender to the same
extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section 2.03(d),
but shall have no claim against any other Lender, notwithstanding the exchange
of interests in the applicable Borrower's reimbursement obligations pursuant to
paragraph (a) above. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such
defaulting Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default,
including, in the event such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM
Percentage of the defaulted amount of such defaulting Lender.

            (f) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its LC
Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative
Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the
Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest
such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender which has not withdrawn its
CAM Percentage of amounts in its LC Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (e)
above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified by the
Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the
Administrative Agent with amounts in its LC Reserve Account and to retain such
earnings for its own account.

                              ARTICLE X. GUARANTEE

            SECTION 10.01. GUARANTEE. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 10.01(a), each Guarantor hereby guarantees to each Lender and the
Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt
payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by
optional prepayment or otherwise) of the Obligations, strictly in accordance
with the terms thereof. Each Guarantor hereby further agrees that if any
Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration, by optional prepayment or otherwise) any of the Obligations, the
Guarantor will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever,
and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of
the Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at
extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of
such extension or renewal. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the
contrary, Oatshare Limited and Sotheby's will not be liable as Guarantors for
the Obligations of Holdings, Sotheby's, Inc. and Sotheby's Global Trading GmbH.

            SECTION 10.02. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of each
Guarantor under Section 10.01 hereof are absolute and unconditional irrespective
of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the
obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other
circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this
Section 10.02 that the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more
of the following shall not affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder:

            (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the
      Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the
      Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be
      waived;

<Page>
                                                                              54


            (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this
      Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or
      therein shall be done or omitted; or

            (c) the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or
      any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any
      respect, or any right under this Agreement or any other agreement or
      instrument referred to herein or therein shall be waived or any other
      guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be
      released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with.

Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed
against any Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.

            SECTION 10.03. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of each Guarantor
under this Article IX shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent
that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower in respect of
the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any
of the Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration.

            SECTION 10.04. SUBROGATION. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by operation of law
(including, without limitation, any such right arising under Title 11 of the
United States Code) or otherwise, by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IX and further agrees for the benefit of each of its
creditors (including, without limitation, each Lender and the Administrative
Agent) that any such payment by it of the Obligations of any Borrower shall
constitute a contribution of capital or a dividend, as the case may be, by such
Guarantor to such Borrower.

            SECTION 10.05. REMEDIES. Each Guarantor agrees that, as between the
Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement
may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VII
hereof (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the
circumstances provided in said Article VII) for purposes of Section 10.01 hereof
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration (or preventing such obligations from becoming automatically due and
payable) as against any Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or
such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable),
such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Borrower) shall
forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for purposes of such Section
10.01.

            SECTION 10.06. CONTINUING GUARANTEE. The guarantee in this Article
IX is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever
arising.

decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that
it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at one of its offices in
The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to
time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (e) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative
Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) above and, as required, the written consent of Holdings and the
Administrative Agent to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information
contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the
Lenders.

            (f) Each Lender may without the consent of Holdings, the Issuing
Bank or the Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment or Term
Commitment, if any, and the Revolving Loans, Term Loans or LC Disbursements
owing to it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) the participating banks or other entities shall be entitled to the benefit
of the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.13, 2.15 and 2.19 to
the same extent as if they were Lenders and (iv) the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce the obligations of the Borrowers relating to the Loans and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other
than amendments, modifications or waivers decreasing any fees payable hereunder
or the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the
Loans, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the
payment of interest on the Loans or changing or extending the Commitments).

            (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 11.04, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrowers; PROVIDED that, prior to any such disclosure of
information, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant
shall agree on terms substantially similar to those set forth in Section 11.17
to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information.

            (h) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including without limitation (i) any pledge or assignment to
secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank and (ii) in the case of any Lender
that is a fund that invests in loans, any pledge or assignment to any holders of
obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee
for, or any other representative of, such holders, and this Section 11.04 shall
not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that
no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such a pledge or
assignment, the applicable Borrower shall, at the request of the assigning
Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory note or
notes evidencing the Loans made to such Borrower by the assigning Lender
hereunder.

            (i) The Borrowers shall not assign or delegate any of their rights
or duties hereunder, except pursuant to a merger permitted by Section 6.03.

            SECTION 11.05. EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. (a) Each Borrower agrees to pay
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
or in connection with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be
consummated) or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection
with the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans made
hereunder, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cravath,
Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Administrative Agent, and, in connection with
any such enforcement or protection, the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of any other counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender
and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in
connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or any demand for payment thereunder. Each Borrower further agrees that
it shall indemnify the Lenders from and hold them harmless against any
documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any Governmental Authority by
reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.

            (b) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, each Lender and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (each such person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all actual losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees,
charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee
arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution
or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, (ii) the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the
Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; PROVIDED
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

            (c) The provisions of this Section 11.05 shall remain operative and
in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Letters of Credit, the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or

                                                                              59


any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 11.05 shall be payable on
written demand therefor.

            SECTION 11.06. RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such other Loan Document and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may
have.

            SECTION 11.07. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

            SECTION 11.08. WAIVERS; AMENDMENT. (a) No failure or delay of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any
Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No
notice or demand on any Borrower in any case shall entitle such Borrower to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no such agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the
maturity of or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of
any interest on any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part
thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) change or extend the Commitment or
decrease the Commitment Fees of any Lender or extend any payment date therefor
without the prior written consent of such Lender, or (iii) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.16, the provisions of Article IX, the provisions of this
Section or the definition of the term "Required Lenders", without the prior
written consent of each Lender; PROVIDED FURTHER that no such agreement shall
amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative
Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

            SECTION 11.09. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate, together
with all fees and charges which are treated as interest under applicable law
(collectively the "CHARGES"), as provided for herein or in any other document
executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for, charged, received,
taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the
"Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or
reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest

<Page>
                                                                              60


payable on the Loans of such Lender, together with all Charges payable to such
Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

            SECTION 11.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to the
subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto
and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 11.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each party hereto hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 11.11.

            SECTION 11.12. SEVERABILITY. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

            SECTION 11.13. JUDGMENT CURRENCY. (a) The Borrowers' obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in Dollars or in
the Alternative Currency (the "OBLIGATION CURRENCY") shall not be discharged or
satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or
converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the
extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency
expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or
enforcing judgment against any Borrower or in any court or in any jurisdiction,
it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the
Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the
"JUDGMENT CURRENCY") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion
shall be made at the Alternative Currency Equivalent or Dollar Equivalent, in
the case of any Alternative Currency or Dollars, and, in the case of other
currencies, the rate of exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if
the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by
a known dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative Agent)
determined, in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the day on which
the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the
"Judgment Currency Conversion Date").

            (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between
the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any judgment, such additional amounts,
if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be necessary to ensure
that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of
exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the
Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of

<Page>
                                                                              61


Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of
exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion Date.

            (c) For purposes of determining the Alternative Currency Equivalent
or Dollar Equivalent or rate of exchange for this Section, such amounts shall
include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of the
Obligation Currency.

            SECTION 11.14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of
which when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 11.03.

            SECTION 11.15. HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

            SECTION 11.16. JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS. (a) Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any
Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents against any Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other Loan
Documents in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

            (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

            SECTION 11.17. CONFIDENTIALITY. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 11.04(g), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral
Agent and each of the Lenders agrees to keep confidential (and (i) to cause its
respective officers, directors and employees to keep confidential and (ii) to
use its best efforts to cause its respective agents and representatives to keep
confidential) the Information (as defined below) and all copies thereof,
extracts therefrom and analyses or other materials based thereon, except that
the Agent or any Lender shall be permitted to disclose Information (a) to such
of its respective affiliates, officers, directors employees, agents and
representatives as need to know such Information, (b) to the extent requested by
any bank regulatory authority, (c)(i) to the extent otherwise required by
applicable laws and regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process or
(ii) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, (d) to the extent
such Information (i) becomes publicly available other

<Page>
                                                                              62


than as a result of a breach of this Agreement or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrowers or (e) to the extent Holdings shall have consented to
such disclosure in writing. For the purposes of this Section, "Information"
shall mean all information that is received from and relates to Holdings or any
of its Subsidiaries other than any such information available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to its
disclosure thereto by Holdings or any such Subsidiary. The provisions of this
Section 11.17 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
the expiration of this Agreement.

            SECTION 11.18. RELEASE OF LIENS AND GUARANTEES. (a) Except as
provided in paragraph (b) below, no amendment to the Loan Documents that has the
effect of releasing all or substantially all the Collateral or any of the
guarantees under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreements or hereunder shall be
effective except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Borrowers and all the Lenders. It is expressly understood that an
amendment providing that additional obligations will be secured under the
Security Documents will not constitute a release of Collateral for purposes of
this paragraph.

            (b) In the event that Holdings or any Subsidiary sells, transfers or
otherwise disposes of all or any portion of any of the Equity Interests, assets
or property owned by Holdings or such Subsidiary in a transaction not prohibited
by this Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall
promptly (and the Lenders hereby authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Borrower to release any Liens created by any
Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests, assets or property, including
the release and satisfaction of record of any mortgage or deed of trust granted
in connection herewith, and, in the case of a disposition of all or
substantially all the Equity Interests or assets of any Subsidiary, to terminate
such Subsidiary's obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement and each
other Loan Document. In addition, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the Liens and security interests created by the Security Documents will
automatically terminate when all the Obligations have been paid in full and the
Commitments have been terminated, and the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent will take such actions as are reasonably requested by the
Borrower to evidence such termination. Holdings agrees to pay all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent in connection with
releases of Liens and obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement
provided for in this Section.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrowers (in their capacity as Borrowers
and Guarantors), the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the
day and year first above written.
