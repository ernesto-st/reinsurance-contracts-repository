<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>PREAMBLE</B> </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
<B>PMA CAPITAL CORPORATION</B>, a Pennsylvania corporation (the &#147;Plan
Sponsor&#148;) (then known as the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Corporation) and
certain of its affiliated employers adopted the <B>PMA CAPITAL CORPORATION
EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN</B> (the &#147;Plan&#148;) (then known as
the PMC Executive Deferred Compensation Plan) originally effective February 1,
1988, to permit their eligible executives to defer receipt of a portion of their
annual compensation, provided such executives are members of a select group of
management and highly compensated employees within the meaning of Section 201(2)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(&#147;ERISA&#148;); and </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
the Plan Sponsor&#146;s Board of Directors has reserved the right, in Article
VIII of the Plan, to amend the Plan, provided that no amendment may reduce a
participant&#146;s benefit accrued as of the date of the amendment and further
provided that written notice of such amendment is given to each participant and
the beneficiary of any deceased participant; and </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Plan has
been amended and restated several times, most recently in 1998; and </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
the Plan Sponsor desires to permit participants to defer receipt of compensation
on an annual basis as well as during the annual enrollment period, to request
the distribution of benefits in the event of unexpected hardship, to freeze
employer matching contributions and to provide for immediate distribution of
benefits under certain circumstances in the event of a change of control of the
Plan Sponsor, effective January 1, 1999; and </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
the Plan Sponsor desires to have the rights to benefits, if any, of an eligible
employee who neither renders personal services to the Plan Sponsor or one of its
affiliated employers after December 31, 1998, nor has a balance credited to any
account under the Plan as of December 31, 1998, to be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan in effect on the date that the employee&#146;s
personal services ceased; </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW

held for the Participant&#146;s child under an irrevocable trust or under a
<I>Uniform Gifts to Minors Act</I> custodianship or <I>Uniform Transfers to
Minors Act</I> custodianship shall not be treated as a resource of the

Participant constitute an unforeseeable emergency and thus an Unforeseen
Financial Emergency within the meaning of this Section. Following a uniform
procedure, the Administrator&#146;s determination shall consider any facts or
conditions deemed necessary or advisable by the Administrator, and the
Participant shall be required to submit any evidence of the Participant&#146;s
circumstances that the Administrator requires. The determination as to whether
the Participant&#146;s circumstances are a case of an Unforeseen Financial
Emergency shall be based on the facts of each case; provided however, that all
determinations as to an Unforeseen Financial Emergency shall be uniformly and

which are subject to the claims of the general creditors of the Plan Sponsor in the event
of its insolvency, defined for the purposes of this provision as the Plan Sponsor&#146;s
inability to pay its debts as they become due or that the Plan Sponsor is subject to a
