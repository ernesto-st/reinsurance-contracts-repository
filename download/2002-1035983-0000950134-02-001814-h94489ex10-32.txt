                 A. Amendments to Section 1.1 - Definitions.

                          1. The definition of "EBITDA" in Section 1.1 of the
                 Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the

<PAGE>


                           ""EBITDA" means, for any period, the consolidated
                  pre-tax income for such period, plus the aggregate amount
                  which was deducted for such period in determining such
                  consolidated, pre-tax income in respect of Interest Expense
                  (including amortization of debt discount, imputed interest and
                  capitalized interest), depreciation and amortization,
                  provided, the calculations of EBITDA after the acquisition of
                  assets or entities permitted under Section 8.5(d) shall
                  include pro forma adjustments consistent with the regulations
                  and practices of the United States Securities and Exchange
                  Commission (whether or not applicable) to account for such
                  acquired entity's historical EBITDA for the relevant period or
                  similar adjustments in the case of an asset acquisition; and
                  further provided that impairment to goodwill calculated in
                  accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
                  Intangibles, shall be disregarded for the purposes of
                  calculating EBITDA. The amount of Borrower's reserves booked
                  on or before December 31, 2001 not in excess of $4,800,000 in
                  the aggregate attributable to receivables from Kmart
                  Corporation, and receivables from other Persons attributable
                  to work performed on behalf of Kmart Corporation, may be added
                  back in determining EBITDA, but only to the extent such
                  receivables were deducted in calculating EBITDA; provided,
                  that such addback shall be reduced by the amount of
                  receivables subject to such reserve, if any, collected from
                  Kmart Corporation or any such other Person. EBITDA shall
                  include no calculation in respect of the Subsidiaries listed
                  on Schedule 8.2(d) after the Emcor Sale Effective Date."

                  2. The following definition of "Emcor Sale Effective Date" is
         added in alphabetical order:

                           ""Emcor Sale Effective Date" means the date on which
                  the Asset Sale permitted under Section 8.2(d) is consummated.

                  3. The definition of "Total Commitment" in Section 1.1 of the
         Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following
         substituted therefor:

                           ""Total Commitment" means (a) before the Emcor Sale
                  Effective Date, the sum of the Commitments for each Bank
                  totaling a maximum of $250,000,000.00 for all Banks, and (b)
                  on and after the Emcor Sale Effective Date, the sum of the
                  Commitments for each Bank totaling a maximum of
                  $100,000,000.00 for all Banks."

the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following

                  amount equal to the amount of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds
                  that were not reinvested in the business of the Company or any
                  of its Subsidiaries on or before such date;

                  G. Absence of Default. No event has occurred and is continuing
         or will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         by this Amendment that would, after giving effect to this Amendment,
         constitute an Event of Default or a Default.

         Section 4. Acknowledgment and Consent. The Company is a party to
certain Collateral Documents pursuant to which the Company has created Liens in
favor of the Agents on certain Collateral to secure the Obligations. Each of the
Guarantors party hereto is a party to certain Collateral Documents and the
Guaranty, pursuant to which each such Guarantor has (i) guarantied the
Obligations and (ii) created Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent on
certain Collateral to secure the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor under
the Guaranty. The Guarantors party hereto are collectively referred to herein as
the "Credit Support Parties," and the Collateral Documents and the Guaranty are
collectively referred to herein as the "Credit Support Documents."

         Each Credit Support Party hereby acknowledges that it has reviewed the
terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the
Guaranty and this Amendment and consents to the further amendment of the Credit
Agreement effected pursuant to this Amendment. Each Credit Support Party hereby
confirms that each Credit Support Document to which it is a party or otherwise
bound and all Collateral encumbered thereby will continue to guaranty or secure,
as the case may be, to the fullest extent possible the payment and performance
of all "Obligations," "Guarantied Obligations" and "Secured Obligations," as the
case may be (in each case as such terms are defined in the applicable Credit
Support Document), including without limitation the payment and performance of
all such "Obligations," "Guarantied Obligations" or "Secured Obligations," as
the case may be, in respect of the Obligations of the Company now or hereafter
existing under or in respect of the Amended Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

         Each Credit Support Party acknowledges and agrees that any of the
Credit Support Documents to which it is a party or otherwise bound shall
continue in full force and effect and that all of its obligations thereunder
shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be impaired or limited by the
execution or effectiveness of this Amendment. Each Credit Support Party
represents and warrants that all representations and warranties contained in the
Amended Credit Agreement and the other Credit Support Documents to which it is a
party or otherwise bound are true, correct and complete in all material respects
on and as of the Amendment Effective Date to the same extent as though made on
and as of that date, except to the extent such representations and warranties
specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case they were true, correct
and complete in all material respects on and as of such earlier date.

         Each Credit Support Party acknowledges and agrees that (i)
notwithstanding the conditions to effectiveness set forth in this Amendment,
such Credit Support Party is not required by the terms of the Credit Agreement
or any other Loan Document to consent to the amendments to the Credit Agreement
effected pursuant to this Amendment and (ii) nothing in the Amended Credit
Agreement, this Amendment or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to require
the consent of such Credit Support Party to any future amendments to the Amended
Credit Agreement.
