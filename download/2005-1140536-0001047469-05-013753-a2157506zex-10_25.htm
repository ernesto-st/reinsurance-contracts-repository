OF DISCONTINUANCE<BR>
PURSUANT TO EXECUTIVE LAW &sect; 63(15) </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the provisions of Executive Law &sect; 63 (12), the Donnelly Act (Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 340 et seq.), and the Martin Act (Gen. Bus. Law &sect;
352-c), Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General of the State of New York caused an investigation to be made of Willis Group Holdings&nbsp;LTD, Willis North America&nbsp;Inc., and Willis of New
York,&nbsp;Inc. (collectively "Willis") related to its practices in the purchasing, renewal, placement or servicing of insurance for its clients (the "Attorney General's Investigation"); and the
Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York (the "Superintendent"), pursuant to Insurance Law &sect; 305, conducted an investigation of Willis related to its practices in the
purchasing, renewal, placement or servicing of insurance for its clients (the "Superintendent's Investigation"); and based upon the Attorney General's Investigation and the Superintendent's
Investigation the following findings have been made: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis
is the world's third largest insurance broker and is also a leading provider of risk management, human capital and management consulting. Businesses and
individuals who need insurance as well as insurance companies that need reinsurance retain Willis to help them design an insurance plan and negotiate with insurance companies to get the best mix of
coverage, service, financial security and price. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis
tells its clients through its Clients' Bill of Rights that "Willis represents the client's best interests through our client advocacy model. Willis' global
resources and services are committed to understanding the client's company, its industry and its individual needs. Willis' customized recommendations and solutions will be driven by what is in the
client's best interests. This is the centerpiece of the value Willis provides its clients." (Willis website; http://www.willis.com/ Last visited March&nbsp;27, 2005) </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fact, prior to modifications to its business model in response to the Attorney General's Investigation and the Superintendent's Investigation, Willis conducted its
business putting its own interests first. Willis had entered into a number of contingent or override agreements to receive compensation from insurance carriers in exchange for increasing the volume or
profitability of insurance policies it places with these carriers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis
steered its customers to preferred "Partner" carriers who had signed contingent fee agreements ["PSA's"] with Willis so that it could
achieve maximum payouts. Willis also sent clients' business through its wholesaler, Stewart Smith, in order to obtain bigger commissions, even where it could have placed that business directly with
insurers. Willis also used the leverage it had in the placement of retail insurance with insurers to obtain reinsurance brokerage business from those insurers for its Willis Re reinsurance brokerage
unit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2003, Willis began to centralize its receipt of contingent commissions from a local office basis to a national structure, headed out of New York. This unit was called
Willis Global Markets North America. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
an April&nbsp;4, 2004 e-mail to Rowan Douglas, Executive Director of Willis Global Markets in London, James Drinkwater, Managing Director of Willis
Global Markets in North America and the Willis executive in charge of negotiating national PSA's, explained how an insurer would benefit from having a contingent fee agreement with Willis's national: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underwriters
[insurers] need to realise that our PSA's [contingent fee agreements] are a reward for services that we provide to carriers
such as carrier advocacy.... Carrier Advocacy includes transparency into our organisation and our book, access to our leadership and our clients, an unfair competitive advantage as well as other
benefits that partnership brings. While the downside of not partnering with us is impossible to calculate I think that Hartford, Axis, Ace, St Paul would all advocate the value and the positive effect
that it has on our business. (Emphasis supplied.) (Willis&#151;23996) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinkwater,
in a May&nbsp;15, 2003 e-mail, outlined how he proposed to steer business in the second half of 2003 to Partner carriers that signed national
PSA agreements, noting his intent was to "[m]ake the marketing departments more accountable for growing contingent revenue and reward[ing] them for this
behavior. This can be done by driving business to these carriers." Another idea was "[n]egotiating Enterprise deals with carriers for reaching stretch goals&#151;I am in
the process of doing this with Hartford for the last six months of 2003." Willis -53585&nbsp;-&nbsp;86. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a September&nbsp;2003 internal Willis Report on U.S. Operations, Willis stated that "Marketing centers are reviewing contingent, bonus and override plans to maximize
all agreements during the fourth quarter. Special attention is being given to St. Paul, Chubb, Liberty Mutual, Hartford and Crum&nbsp;&amp; Foster due to special [PSA]
agreements." Willis&#151;43329 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrying
through with these reviews and plans, Drinkwater held a National Planning Meeting in Chicago in late October, 2003. At that meeting the regional marketing
officers of Willis North America agreed on a revenue strategy to "generate $2.5&nbsp;million in unanticipated income from North America in November and December&nbsp;2003." Each of Willis's five
marketing regions in the United States was given an income target so that the $2.5&nbsp;million target would be reached. Responsibility for hitting these targets was assigned to the Regional
Marketing Officers. One of the "Key Objectives" of the $2.5&nbsp;million revenue strategy was to "Maximize premium volume flow to key carriers with most attractive contingent income agreements."
Willis&#151;16095. Drinkwater was explicit. In an October&nbsp;17, 2003 e-mail to the Regional Marketing Officers ("RMOs"), titled "Contingent Income Push," Drinkwater said: "I
need you to drive this initiative&#151;I want to see you directing the flow of business to these companies ["Partner Markets" Crum&nbsp;&amp; Forster, Chubb, St. Paul and Hartford,
insurers with which Willis had contingent revenue agreements]. Drinkwater explained, "... moving business wherever possible to our Partner Markets... will have significant revenue
implications to the Group." Willis 15695&nbsp;-&nbsp;97. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the Chicago National Planning Meeting, the RMOs got the message out to their teams back home. For example, on November&nbsp;1, 2003, the Willis Regional
Marketing Officer for the West Coast, sent an "urgent" e-mail to his marketing team saying: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
just came back from a national planning meeting in chicago with all of the RMO's in attendance. One of the major topics of discussion at our meeting was how each region in North
America could achieve an additional $500,000 in revenue by 12/31/03. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
RMO's collectively devised at [sic] an action plan that we believe will help us achieve this goal. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.
Where possible drive ALL of our new and renewal business to our strategic partners who are paying Willis added incentives for year end growth results. (Emphasis supplied, but ALL
capitalized in original.) Willis&#151;26264. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a November&nbsp;11, 2003 e-mail from the Chief Marketing Officer of Willis North America to the regional and national marketing team, he wrote, "Don't
forget the advantages of placing as much business as possible with the carriers we have negotiated special deals with, as you look for ways to maximize revenues the last few months of this year and
into 2004." Willis&#151;54752. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
some instances Willis personnel were ordered to give business to a specific carrier unless there were "compelling reasons" not to. For example, in an
August&nbsp;26, 2003 e-mail, the Marketing Manager of Willis&#151;Portland told the Northwest marketing team: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate
marketing has signed a contingency agreement with Hartford Steam Boiler making them our preferred Strategic partner for this class of business. Therefore I am mandated to place
all B&amp;M with them unless there is a very compelling reason not to. If you will remember, the whole marketing dept. concept was originally predicated on the fact that we would limit our markets to some
strategic markets where we would place 80% of our business. (Emphasis supplied.) Willis&#151;29760 </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
Willis made it clear to insurers that signing contingent fee agreements with it would mean that Willis would steer business to those carriers. During
negotiation of a 2004 agreement with ACE, James Drinkwater e-mailed Susan Rivera, president of ACE, on December&nbsp;11, 2003 as follows: "One final comment, and possibly most
importantly, the quicker I can get word to our offices that we have agreed to a partnership for 2004 the more opportunity that we may have to get off to a good start in 2004 and focus on writing
January&nbsp;1st business." Willis&#151;44448&nbsp;-&nbsp;49 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed,
when Willis decided in late 2003 that it would establish the job title of Carrier Advocate to manage the Partner Market relationships, Damian Chapman, who was to
be appointed to one of those new positions, drafted an e-mail notification to be sent to the Willis North America regional offices. That draft spelled out explicitly that
"[f]ocusing on our "Partner' markets will require premium flows to be restructured as non partner markets are de-emphasized." Willis&#151;44136. James
Drinkwater edited out this clear admission that carriers who did not pay contingents would have their business suffer, changing Chapman's language to, "[f]ocusing on our
"Partner' markets will require the management of our premium flows and the overall relationship." Willis&#151;44157&nbsp;-&nbsp;58. Notwithstanding Drinkwater's euphemism, the
intent was clear: premiums would be shifted to "Partners', i.e. to carriers having contingent agreements with Willis, and away from carriers having none. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
explained in &para;&para; 9&nbsp;-&nbsp;12 above, the goal of reaching $2.5&nbsp;million of unanticipated income in November and
December&nbsp;2003 was carried out in the regions. But the methods used by the regions did not stop at simply steering business to carriers with lucrative contingent fee agreements. The regions also
directed as much business as possible through Willis-owned wholesaler Stewart Smith, sought additional upfront commissions from insurers, and pushed for any reinsurance needed by the insurers to be
placed through Willis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members
of Willis realized that they could gain additional commissions through placing clients through its wholly owned wholesaler Stewart Smith, thereby gaining a
second commission when Willis could have directly placed the business for a single price. For example, in the Willis Florida office, the Director of Marketing, described two of these occurrences in a
December&nbsp;1, 2003 e-mail called "Maximizing Revenues": "Lincare (Umbrella, Professional, GL)&#151;after negotiating acceptable premiums, we ran this through Stewart Smith
[Willis's wholesaler] for additional income to group of more than $156,000. Fee Account." Willis&#151;44079. In other words, regardless of the fact that Lincare paid
Willis a fee for its placement services to Lincare, Willis sent this business through it's wholesaler Stewart Smith and earned an additional $156,000 on the Lincare placement. The same
e-mail also described another similar placement, this time for "Central Concrete Supermix (Umbrella)&#151;renewing with AIG, via Stewart Smith (versus direct), additional income to
group of $100,000. Fee account." Willis&#151;44079. Had Willis gone direct to AIG, Willis would have received only the fee that Central Concrete Supermix had agreed to pay Willis for the
placement. Instead Willis received an additional $100,000. The e-mail also noted that Willis's Florida office had also been steering accounts to contingent markets "in order to maximize
our contingencies...." Willis&#151;44079&nbsp;-&nbsp;80 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly,
in a November&nbsp;3, 2003 e-mail the head of the Willis Northeast Marketing team instructed his team members that in order to help meet
$2.5&nbsp;million additional revenue year end target, they should (1)&nbsp;ask for 2% additional commission on all renewals, (2)&nbsp;run all fee accounts through Stewart Smith, the Willis
wholesaler, wherever possible, (3)&nbsp;"feed our biggest contingency players, Hartford, St. Paul, Chubb and Liberty Mutual", and (4)&nbsp;"look to get Willis Re
[reinsurance] involved in any accounts possible." Willis&#151;35628&nbsp;-&nbsp;29 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis's
stated goal to get Willis Re involved in any retail account possible was actively pursued. From early in 2003 until well after the Attorney General's and the
Superintendent's investigations had commenced, Tony Ainsworth was responsible for coordinating Willis's efforts to use the leverage it had with insurers through Willis's placement of retail insurance
with those insurers to obtain facultative reinsurance brokerage business from those insurers. On a monthly basis, Ainsworth prepared spreadsheets to show Willis management his successes in this area.
Willis&#151;0107097&nbsp;-&nbsp;7110 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
month after the Attorney General commenced litigation against one of Willis's competitors, Marsh&nbsp;&amp; McLennnan, Willis began to move to curtail the
e-mail and paper trail of these leveraging activities, while still apparently continuing them. In a frank November&nbsp;15, 2004 e-mail to his colleagues, Ainsworth wrote: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
upon the developments of the last few weeks in our industry [the Marsh lawsuit filed by the Attorney General], I as well as the Management Team have decided
to suspend all e mail and/or written correspondence between Willis Re Fac [Facultative] and Willis Retail/Wholesale effective immediately. This will mean that we will no longer
track [retail] broker / share renewal lists / leverage business, etc.. It does not mean that we will not be working with Retail/Wholesale on accounts but more in a low key
manner. Keep talking to our friends and find out where business is being sent......just do it verbally or in person! (Emphasis supplied.) Willis&#151;107036&nbsp;-&nbsp;37 </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis
was not shy about using the leverage Willis Retail had with insurers to get reinsurance business from those insurers. In one instance, ACE North America had
retained Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance brokerage unit of Marsh&nbsp;&amp; McLennan, to place reinsurance for a contract that Willis Retail had awarded to ACE for ABM, an airport maintenance service
company. Drinkwater, upon discovering the employment of a competing reinsurance broker on a Willis retail account, called Susan Rivera, ACE's President, and insisted that the reinsurance business be
placed through Willis Re. After the call, Rivera ordered ACE to move the reinsurance to Willis Re. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
one instance, Willis also used its relationship with insurance companies to solicit and receive false bids. In 2001, Willis was attempting to obtain bids for
insurance for a parking and shuttle contract its client ABM had received from the Detroit Metro Airport. The airport required that ABM receive three bids from insurance companies. Willis, however, was
unable to get three insurance companies to bid, only receiving a quote from the Fireman's Fund. Willis, therefore, asked two insurance companies, Zurich North America and CNA, to provide bids as a
favor. Willis then told both Zurich and CNA what they should bid in order to ensure that they would not gain the business. In his e-mails to the companies, the Willis broker stated: we
need the alternative quotes to come in higher that [Fireman's Fund's] first dollar indication. I have come up with a premium breakdown that follows, and need a quote letter
from you so that ABM can meet the terms of the insurance requirement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zurich
and CNA complied with the requests, submitting the false bids as detailed by the Willis broker, without performing any underwriting work. These bids were then submitted by Willis
to the Detroit Metro Airport on behalf of ABM. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis
attempted to manage the timing of contingent fee payments. In late 2003 James Drinkwater sought out a number of insurance companies, promising increased business
in exchange for as yet unearned payments before year end. One of the companies that accepted the offer was ACE North America, which agreed to advance Willis $500,000. To justify the receipt of these
funds on Willis's books, Drinkwater personally convinced Susan Rivera, ACE's president, to send him fraudulent e-mails, drafted by Drinkwater himself, to make it appear that Willis was
entitled to the funds in 2003. These inaccurate e-mails were then given to Willis's auditors to justify the recording of the payment. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on these facts, the Attorney General and the Superintendent find that Willis unlawfully deceived its clients by (a)&nbsp;steering clients' insurance business to
favored insurance companies, (b)&nbsp;unnecessarily running business through its wholly owned wholesaler, Stewart Smith, and (c)&nbsp;leveraging its retail brokerage business in order to obtain
reinsurance brokerage business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis
is cooperating with the Attorney General's and the Superintendent's Investigations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the wake of the issuance of the subpoenas and the Attorney General's Investigation and the Superintendent's Investigation, Willis has adopted and under this Assurance
of Discontinuance (the "Assurance"), and a corresponding Stipulation with the Superintendent, will continue to implement a number of business reforms governing the conduct of Willis's employees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
