         Section 2.2. Loan Accounts. (a) The Loans made by each Lender and the
Letters of Credit Issued by the Issuing Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
accounts or records maintained by such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case
may be, and the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The
accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
(including the Issuing Lender) shall be prima facie evidence as to the amount of
the Loans made by the Lenders to the Company and the Letters of Credit Issued
for the account of the Company, and the interest and payments thereon. Any
failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or
otherwise affect the obligation of the Company hereunder to pay any amount owing
with respect to any Loan or Letter of Credit. In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender (including the Issuing
Lender) and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
in the absence of manifest error.

         (b)      Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative
Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the
Administrative Agent), a Note or Notes which shall evidence the Loans made by
such Render in addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section
2.2(a). Each such Lender is hereby authorized to endorse on the schedules
annexed to its Note(s) the date, amount and maturity of each Loan made by it and
the amount of each payment of principal made by the Company with respect
thereto. Each such Lender is irrevocably authorized by the Company to endorse
its Note(s) and each Lender's record shall be conclusive absent manifest error;
provided that the failure of a Lender to make, or an error in making, a notation
thereon with respect to any Loan shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Company hereunder or under any Note to such Lender.

         (c)      In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section
2.2(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales
by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans. In
the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
in the absence of manifest error.

         Section 2.3. Procedure for Borrowing, (a) Each Borrowing shall be made
upon the Company's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be
given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative
Agent (i) prior to 12:00 p.m. at least one Business Day prior to the Initial
Distribution Date in connection with any of the Borrowings to be made on the
Initial Distribution Date or Time of Merger, (ii) at least three Business Days
prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurodollar Revolving Rate
Credit Loans and (iii) prior to 12:00 p.m. at least one Business Day prior to
the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Base Rate Loans. Each telephone
notice by the Company

<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a written Notice of Borrowing, appropriately completed
and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company. Each Notice of Borrowing
(whether telephonic or written) shall specify:

                  (A)      (i) in the case of the Term Borrowings to be made in
         connection with the occurrence of the Initial Distribution Date, the
         Initial Distribution Borrowing Amount, (ii) in the case of the Term
         Borrowings to be made in connection with the occurrence of the Time of
         Merger, the Merger Borrowing Amount and (iii) in the case of any
         Revolving Credit Borrowing, the amount of such Revolving Credit
         Borrowing, which shall be in an amount of at least $5,000,000 or a
         higher integral multiple of $100,000;

                  (B)      the requested Borrowing Date, which shall be a
         Business Day;

                  (C)      the Type of Loans comprising the Borrowing;

                  (D)      in the case of any Term Borrowing, the aggregate
         principal amount of the Initial Distribution Borrowing Amount or Merger
         Borrowing Amount, as the case may be, to be denominated in Euros; and

                  (E)      in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Eurodollar
         Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period applicable to such
         Loans included in such notice.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
Lender of its receipt of any Notice of Borrowing and of the amount of such
Lender's share of the related Borrowing based, as applicable, upon such Lender's
Revolving Credit Percentage or such Lender's applicable Term Percentage.

                  (c)      Each Lender will make the amount of its share of each
Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Company
at the Agent's Payment Office by 2:00 p.m. on the Borrowing Date requested by
the Company in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Upon
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.3 (and, if such
Borrowing is being made in connection with the occurrence of the Initial
Distribution Date, Section 5.1 or if such Borrowing is being made at the Time of
Merger, Section 5.2), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received
available to the Company in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent
either by (i) crediting the account of the Company on the books of Bank of
America with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative
Agent by the Lenders or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in
accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the
Administrative Agent by the Company; provided, however, that if, on the date the
Notice of Borrowing with respect to such Borrowing, there are Swingline Loans or
L/C Advances outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied,
first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Advances, second, to the payment
in full of any such Swingline Loans, and third, to the Company as provided
above.

                  (d)      After giving effect to any Borrowing, there may not
be more than 12 different Interest Periods in effect.

                  Section 2.4. Conversion and Continuation Elections, (a) The
 Company may, upon irrevocable notice (which may be given by telephone) to the
 Administrative Agent:

                  (i)      elect to convert, on any Business Day, any Base Rate
         Loans (in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (or the currency equivalent
         thereof) or a higher integral multiple of $100,000 (or the currency
         equivalent thereof)) into Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate
         Loans, as the case may be;

                  (ii)     elect to convert, on the last day of the applicable
         Interest Period, any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans,
         as the case may be (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount of
         $5,000,000 (or the currency equivalent thereof) or a higher integral
         multiple of $100,000 (or the currency equivalent thereof)), into Base
         Rate Loans; or

                  (iii)    elect to continue, as of the last day of the
         applicable Interest Period, any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar
         Rate Loans, as the case may be, having Interest Periods expiring on
         such day (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (or
         the currency equivalent thereof) or a higher integral multiple of
         $100,000 (or the currency equivalent thereof));

provided that if at any time the aggregate amount of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, in respect of any Borrowing shall
have been reduced, by payment, prepayment or conversion of part thereof, to be
less than $5,000,000 (or the currency equivalent thereof), such Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall automatically
convert into Base Rate Loans.

                  (b)       Each notice of conversion or continuation of Loans
 delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(a) must be delivered by the Company to, and
 received by, the Administrative Agent (i) prior to 12:00 p.m. at least four
 Business Days prior to the Conversion Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be
 converted into or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii) prior to 12:00
 p.m. at least three Business Days prior to the Conversion/Continuation Date, if
 the Loans are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans and
 (iii) prior to 12:00 p.m. at least one Business Day prior to the
 Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted into Base Rate
 Loans. Each telephone notice by the Company pursuant to Section 2.4(a) must be
 confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Notice
 of Conversion/Continuation, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
 Officer of the Company. Each Notice of Conversion/Continuation (whether
 telephonic or written) shall specify:

                  (A)      the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date;

                  (B)      the aggregate principal amount of Loans to be
         converted or continued;

                  (C)      the Type of Loans resulting from the proposed
         conversion or continuation; and

                  (D)      in the case of conversions into Eurocurrency Rate
         Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, the duration of the requested Interest
         Period.

                                       52

<PAGE>

                  (c)      If upon the expiration of any Interest Period
applicable to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Company has
failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to such
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, the
Company shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurocurrency Rate Loans
or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, into Base Rate Loans effective as
of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

                  (d)      The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or, if no timely
notice is provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify
each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion. All conversions and
continuations shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding
principal amounts of the Loans held by each Lender with respect to which the
notice was given.

                  (e)      A Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan may
be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be. Unless the
Required Lenders otherwise agree, during the existence of a Default or Event of
Default, the Company may not elect to have a Loan converted into or continued as
a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be.

                  (f)      After giving effect to any conversion or continuation
of Loans, there may not be more than 12 different Interest Periods in effect.

                 (g)       For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
2.4 is intended to result in, or permit, any redenomination of any Euro Term B
Loan into a Dollar Term B Loan or of any Dollar Term B Loan into a Euro Term B
Loan.

                  Section 2.5. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole discretion, make a
portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments available to the Company by making
swingline loans (each such loan, a "SWINGLINE LOAN") to the Company on any
Business Day during the period from the Time of Merger to the Revolving Credit
Loan Maturity Date in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
2.5 in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed
the lesser of (i) the aggregate available amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments, (ii) the Borrowing Base and (iii) $25,000,000, notwithstanding the
fact that such Swingline Loans, when aggregated with the Swingline Lender's
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, may exceed the Swingline Lender's Revolving
Credit Percentage of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments;
provided that (A) at no time shall the sum of the Effective Amount of all
Swingline Loans, Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations exceed the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and (B) the aggregate Effective
Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans owed to any Lender plus such Lender's
Revolving Credit Percentage of the Effective Amount of all Swingline Loans plus
such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the Effective Amount of all L/C
Obligations shall not exceed the lesser of (1) such Lender's Revolving Credit
Commitment and (2) such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the Borrowing
Base. Subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company may borrow
under this Section 2.5(a), prepay pursuant to Section 2.5(d) and reborrow
pursuant to this

                                       53

<PAGE>

Section 2.5(a) from time to time; provided that (A) the Swingline Lender shall
not be obligated to make any Swingline Loan and (B) the Company shall not use
the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan.
Each Swingline Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a
Swingline Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a
risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of
such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage multiplied by the
amount of such Swingline Loan.

                  (b)      The Company shall provide the Administrative Agent
and the Swingline Lender irrevocable written notice (or notice by a telephone
call confirmed promptly by facsimile) of any Swingline Loan requested hereunder
(which notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative
Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. on the requested Borrowing Date) specifying (i) the
amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, which must be a
Business Day. Upon receipt of such notice, the Swingline Lender will promptly
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
Administrative Agent has received a copy of such notice from the Company and, if
not, the Swingline Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
thereof. If and only if the Administrative Agent notifies the Swingline Lender
on the proposed Borrowing Date that it may make available to the Company the
amount of the requested Swingline Loan, then, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender may make the amount of the requested
Swingline Loan available to the Company by crediting the account of the Company
on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such Swingline Loan. The
Administrative Agent will not so notify the Swingline Lender if the
Administrative Agent has knowledge that (A) the limitations set forth in the
proviso set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.5(a) are being violated or
would be violated by such Swingline Loan or (B) one or more of the conditions
specified in Article V is not then satisfied. Each Swingline Loan shall be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to $500,000 or a higher integral multiple of
$100,000. The Swingline Lender will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of
the amount of each Swingline Loan.

                 (c)       Principal of and accrued interest on each Swingline
Loan shall be due and payable (i) on demand made by the Swingline Lender at any
time upon one Business Day's prior notice to the Company with a copy to the
Administrative Agent furnished at or before 11:45 a.m., and (ii) in any event on
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Interest on Swingline Loans shall be for the
sole account of the Swingline Lender (except to the extent that the other
Lenders have funded the purchase of participations therein pursuant to Section
2.5(e)).

                  (d)      The Company may, from time to time on any Business
Day, make a voluntary prepayment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding
principal amount of any Swingline Loan, without incurring any premium or
penalty; provided that

                  (i)      each such voluntary prepayment shall require prior
         written notice given to the Administrative Agent and the Swingline
         Lender no later than 12:00 p.m. on the day on which the Company intends
         to make a voluntary prepayment, and

                                       54

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     each such voluntary prepayment shall be in an amount
         equal to $500,000 or a higher integral multiple of $100,000 (or, if
         less, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans
         then outstanding).

Voluntary prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be made by the Company to the
Swingline Lender at such office as the Swingline Lender may designate by notice
to the Company from time to time. All such payments shall be made in Dollars and
in immediately available funds no later than 5:00 p.m. on the date specified by
the Company pursuant to Section 2.5(d)(i) (and any payment received later than
such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day). The
Swingline Lender will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the amount of
each prepayment of Swingline Loans.

                 (e)       If (i) any Swingline Loan shall remain outstanding at
12:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to a Business Day on which
Swingline Loans are due and payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c) and by such time
on such Business Day the Administrative Agent shall have received neither (A) a
Notice of Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 2.3 requesting that Revolving
Credit Loans be made pursuant to Section 2.l(c) on such following Business Day
in an amount at least equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Swingline
Loans, nor (B) any other notice indicating the Company's intent to repay such
Swingline Loans with funds obtained from other sources, or (ii) any Swingline
Loans shall remain outstanding during the existence of a Default or Event of
Default and the Swingline Lender shall in its sole discretion notify the
Administrative Agent that the Swingline Lender desires that such Swingline Loans
be converted into Revolving Credit Loans, then the Administrative Agent shall be
deemed to have received a Notice of Borrowing from the Company pursuant to
Section 2.3 requesting that Base Rate Loans be made pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
on the following Business Day in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such
Swingline Loans, and the procedures set forth in Sections 2.3(b) and 2.3(c)
shall be followed in making such Base Rate Loans; provided that such Base Rate
Loans shall be made notwithstanding the Company's failure to comply with Section
5.3; and provided further that if a Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans becomes
legally impracticable and if so required by the Swingline Lender at the time
such Revolving Credit Loans are required to be made by the Revolving Credit
Lenders in accordance with this Section 2.5(e), each Revolving Credit Lender
agrees that any notice from the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to be a request
by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk
participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Credit Lender's
payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.5(e) shall be deemed payment in respect of such
participation. The proceeds of such Base Rate Loans (or participations
purchased) shall be delivered by the Administrative Agent to the Swingline
Lender to repay such Swingline Loans (or as payment for such participations). A
copy of each notice given by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Credit
Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.5(e) with respect to the making of Loans, or
the purchases of participations, shall be promptly delivered by the
Administrative Agent to the Company. Each Revolving Credit Lender's obligation
in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Credit Loans, or
purchase the participations, as contemplated by this Section 2.5(e), shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including (1) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Revolving Credit Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the
Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (2) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default, Event of Default or any event that has or could

                                       55

<PAGE>

reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse Effect or (3) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing. No funding of risk participations pursuant to this Section 2.5(e)
shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to repay any
outstanding Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein.

                  (f)      At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has
purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline
Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline
Lender will distribute to such Lender an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving
Credit Percentage of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of
interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk
participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swingline
Lender. If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal
or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline
Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its
discretion) each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender in an
amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of
the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to
the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the
Swing Line Lender.

                  Section 2.6. Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) The
Term Commitments will automatically terminate in full on the earlier to occur
of (i) the Time of Merger (after giving effect to any Term Borrowings made on
such date) and (ii) March 31, 2003.

                  (b)      The Company may, upon not less than three Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, permanently reduce the
Revolving Credit Commitments to an amount which is not less than the sum of the
Effective Amount of all Revolving Credit Loans plus the Effective Amount of all
Swingline Loans plus the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations. Any such
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a higher integral
multiple of $5,000,000 and shall be applied to reduce the Revolving Credit
Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender by an amount equal to such Lender's
Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount of any such reduction. The Company may
at any time on like notice terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments upon
payment in full of all Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans and Cash
Collateralization in full of all L/C Obligations.

                  (c)      After payment in full of all Term Loans pursuant to
Section 2.7(b), upon the occurrence of any Mandatory Prepayment Event, the
Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender shall be
automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal to such Lender's
Revolving Credit Percentage of the Designated Proceeds resulting from such
Mandatory Prepayment Event, with each such reduction effective at the time
required in Section 2.7(b) for a prepayment of Loans resulting from such
Mandatory Prepayment Event.

                  (d)      In the event that the Time of Merger has not occurred
on or prior to March 31, 2003, the Revolving Credit Commitments will
automatically terminate in full.

                                       56

<PAGE>

                  (e)      Once reduced in accordance with this Section, the
Commitments may not be increased. All accrued commitment fees to, but not
including, the effective date of any reduction or termination of the any
Commitment shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.

                  Section 2.7. Prepayments. (a) The Company may, upon at least
one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate Loans and three Business
Day's notice in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans,
in each case to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate
principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Company
shall, prepay the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising
part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with (i)
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate amount prepaid
and (ii) in the case of any such prepayment of any of the Term B Loans (A) on or
prior to the first anniversary of this Agreement, a premium of 2.00% or (B) on
or prior to the second anniversary of this Agreement, a premium of 1.00%, in
either case of the aggregate principal amount of Term B Loans being so prepaid;
provided, however, that (1) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $5,000,000 (which in the case of any prepayment in respect
of the Term B Loan, shall include the Dollar Equivalent of any Euro Term B Loans
being so prepaid) or an integral multiple of $100,000 (which in the case of any
prepayment in respect of a Term B Loan, shall include the Dollar Equivalent of
any Euro Term B Loans being so prepaid) in excess thereof and if any prepayment
of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan is made on a date other than
the last day of an Interest Period for such Loan, the Company shall also pay
amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.5. Any premium payable pursuant to this
Section 2.7(a) shall be payable to any Term B Lender only to the extent that any
such Term B Lender actually receives a prepayment of the Term B Loans, owing to
such Term B Lender, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall not be required to pay any prepayment premium to any Term A Lender,
Revolving Credit Lender or any Declining Lender.

                  (b)      The Company shall make a prepayment of the Loans upon
the occurrence of any of the following (each a "MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT") at
the following times and in the following amounts (such applicable amounts being
referred to as "DESIGNATED PROCEEDS"):

                 (i)       Within 180 days after any Asset Sale (other than any
         Asset Sale permitted under Sections 8.2(a) through 8.2(i) (other than
         as to any such Section which is addressed in clauses (ii) through (vi)
         below) to a Person other than a Loan Party or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries, in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds
         actually received by any Loan Party or Subsidiary thereof in connection
         with such sale, transfer or other disposition; provided that (A) the
         foregoing shall not apply (1) to Asset Sales, the proceeds (or an
         amount equal to anticipated proceeds) of which are used or committed to

         or other disposition of the Company's San Jose Plant #3 received or to

         shall not be required to prepay Loans in an amount equal to such
         proceeds, and such proceeds shall not constitute "DESIGNATED PROCEEDS"
         hereunder.

                  (ii)     Within 30 days after any Asset Sale (including by way
         of merger or consolidation) by a Loan Party or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries, of any of the Equity Interests in any such Loan Party's

         receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from the issuance of any Other Debt of

         Calculation) as of the end of such fiscal year is less than
         $400,000,000, then no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this

         Facility, in an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds of such transfer;
         provided that if the Permitted Receivables Facility is a revolving
         program, the Designated Proceeds available for application to the Loans
         from such Permitted Receivables Facility shall not exceed the maximum
         outstanding amount of such Permitted Receivables Facility (without
         giving effect to any reduction in such amount but giving effect to any
         increase in such amount).

                  (c)      Each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.7
(a) shall be applied ratably to the remaining installments of such Term Loans.
Each prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(a) shall be
applied in accordance with Section 2.7(h)

                  (d)       Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(b)

Loans and to such installments, subject to Section 2.7(g), in accordance with
each Term Lender's Term Percentage and second to the Revolving Credit Loans,
Swingline Loans and L/C Advances as set forth in Section 2.7(h).

                  (e)      If on any day the Effective Amount of all Revolving
Credit Loans plus the Effective Amount of all Swingline Loans plus the Effective
Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the lesser of (i) the Revolving Credit
Commitments and (ii) the Borrowing Base, the

                                       58

Company shall immediately prepay Revolving Credit Loans and/or Swingline Loans
or Cash Collateralize the outstanding Letters of Credit, or do a combination of
the foregoing, in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                  (f)       If on any date the Effective Amount of L/C
Obligations exceeds the amount of the L/C Commitment, the Company shall Cash
Collateralize on such date the outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal
to the excess of the L/C Obligations over the amount of the L/C Commitment.

                  (g)      With respect to any prepayment of Term Loans (other
than pursuant to Section 2.7(i)), the Administrative Agent shall ratably pay
the Term Lenders in accordance with their applicable Total Term Percentages;
provided, however, that any Term B Lender, at its option, to the extent that any
Term A Loans are then outstanding, may elect not to accept such prepayment. Upon
receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such prepayment, the amount of the
prepayment that is available to prepay the Term B Loans shall be deposited in a
cash collateral account on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and the Company (the "PREPAYMENT AMOUNT"), pending application of such
amount on the Prepayment Date as set forth below and promptly after such receipt
(the date of such receipt being the "RECEIPT DATE"), the Administrative Agent
shall give written notice to the Term B Lenders of the amount available to
prepay the Term B Loans (to the extent applicable) and the date on which such
prepayment shall be made (the "PREPAYMENT DATE"), which date shall be seven
Business Days after the Receipt Date. Any Term B Lender declining such
prepayment (a "DECLINING LENDER") shall given written notice to the
Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m. at least three Business Days prior to the
Prepayment Date. On the Prepayment Date, an amount equal to that portion of the
Prepayment Amount accepted by the Term B Lenders other than the Declining
Lenders (such Lenders being the "ACCEPTING LENDERS") to prepay Term B Loans
owing to such Accepting Lenders shall be withdrawn from the cash collateral
account and applied to prepay Term B Loans owing to such Accepting Lenders on a
pro rata basis. Any amounts that would otherwise have been applied to prepay
Term B Loans owing to Declining Lenders shall instead be applied to prepay the
remaining Term A Loans as provided in this Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary no "PREPAYMENT AMOUNT" shall include any premiums payable
to any Accepting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

                  (h)      Prepayments of Loans (other than Term Loans) made
pursuant to Sections 2.7(a), 2.7(b) and 2.7(e) shall be first applied to prepay
L/C Advances then outstanding until such L/C Advances are paid in full, second
applied to prepay Swingline Loans then outstanding in accordance with each
Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage until such Loans are paid
in full, third applied to prepay Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding until
such Loans are paid in full and fourth applied to Cash Collateralize any
outstanding Letter of Credit; and, in the case of prepayments of Loans (other
than Term Loans) required pursuant to Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(e), the amount
remaining (if any) after prepayment in full of all Loans then outstanding and
the 100% Cash Collateralization of any outstanding Letters of Credit (the sum of
such prepayment amounts, Cash Collateral amounts and remaining amounts being
referred to herein as the "REDUCTION AMOUNT") may be retained by the Company and
the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanently reduced as set forth in
Section 2.6(d).

                  (i)      If on the last Business Day of any January, April,
July or October, the aggregate outstanding Dollar Equivalent of the principal
amount of Euro Term B Loans exceeds the sum of (A) $45,000,000 less the Dollar
Equivalent of all repayments of the principal amount of any Euro Term B Loan as
of any date of calculation (the "BASE AMOUNT") plus (B) the product of the Base
Amount multiplied by 10%, the Company shall immediately following notice from
the Administrative Agent thereof prepay to the Administrative Agent for the
ratable benefit of the Euro Term B Loans the amount equal to the amount of such
excess.

                  Section 2.8. Repayment. (a) The Company shall repay to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Term A Lenders the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Term A Loans on the following dates in the
amounts represented by the percentages set forth below, as the respective
percentages of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term A Loans
outstanding as of the Time of Merger (after giving effect to any Term A
Borrowing made on or prior to such time) (which amounts shall be reduced as a
result of the application of repayments in accordance with Section 2.7).

                  (c)      The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the ratable account of the Revolving Credit Lenders, on the Revolving Credit
Loan Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans

 than any Swingline Loan) and Term Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
 principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a rate per annum
 equal to (i) in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Eurodollar Rate or
 (ii) in the case of any Euro Term B Loan, the Eurocurrency Rate, and in either
 case, the Base Rate, as the case may be (and subject to the Company's right to
 convert to the other Type of Loans under Section 2.4), plus the Applicable Rate
 as in effect from time to time with respect to such Revolving Credit Loan or
 Term Loan, as the case may be. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the

 rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 1% per annum.

                  (b)      Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date therefor. Interest shall also be paid upon payment
(including prepayment) in full of any of the Loans.

of any Event of Default, the Company shall pay interest (after as well as before
entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal
amount of all outstanding Loans and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
on any other amount payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document, at a
rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto pursuant to the
terms hereof or such other Loan Document (or, if no such rate is specified, the
Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate then in effect for Base Rate Revolving Credit
Loans) plus 2%. All such interest shall be payable on demand.

                  (d)      Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding the
obligation of the Company to any Lender in respect of interest payments
hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.12.

                  Section 2.10. Fees. In addition to certain fees described in
Section 3.8:

                  (a)      The Company shall pay fees to the Agents and
         Arrangers for their own accounts, as required by the letter agreement
         among the Company, Heinz, the Arrangers and the Agents dated June
         12, 2002, as modified by that certain letter agreement dated as of
         November 13, 2002 (the "FEE LETTER").

                  (b)      The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
         the account of each Term Lender a commitment fee calculated at a rate
         per annum equal to 0.50% on the daily unused portion of such Term
         Lenders' aggregate Term Commitments. The commitment fee payable
         pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall accrue at all times from the
         date hereof until the date of the termination in full of the Term
         Commitments in accordance with Section 2.6, including at any time
         during which one or more of the conditions in Article V is not met, and
         shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day
         of each January, April, July and October, commencing with the first

                                       62

<PAGE>

         such date to occur after the date hereof, and on the date on which the
         Term Commitments are terminated in full in accordance with Section 2.6.

                 (c)       The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
         the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a commitment fee calculated
         at a rate per annum equal to 0.50% on the average daily unused portion
         of such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment. The
         commitment fee payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) shall accrue at
         all times from the date hereof until the occurrence of the Revolving
         Credit Termination Date, including at any time during which one or more
         of the conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable
         quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each January, April,
         July and October, commencing with the first such date to occur after
         the date hereof and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date based upon
         the daily utilization for each such period as calculated by the
         Administrative Agent. For purposes of calculating utilization Under
         this Section 2.10(c), the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be deemed
         used to the extent of the Effective Amount of all Revolving Credit
         Loans then outstanding (but Swingline Loans shall not constitute usage
         of any Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment for the
         purpose of calculating commitment fees)plus the Effective Amount of
         all L/C Obligations then outstanding.

                  (d)      Any fees paid pursuant to this Section 2.10, shall be
         fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason
         whatsoever.

                 Section 2.11. Computation of Fees and Interest. (a) All
computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by
Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of
interest and fees shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days
elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest
or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.

                  (b)      Each determination of an interest rate by the
Administrative Agent shall be prima facie evidence thereof. The Administrative
Agent will, at the request of the Company or any Lender, deliver to the Company
or such Lender, as the case may be, a statement showing the quotations used by
the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate and the resulting
interest rate.

                  Section 2.12. Payments by the Company. (a) All payments to be
made by the Company shall be made without condition or deduction for any
counter-claim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all payments by the Company shall be made to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders at the Agent's Payment Office, and shall be
made in Dollars or Euros, as the case may be, and in immediately available
funds, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as expressly
provided herein, the Administrative Agent will promptly distribute, in like
funds as received, to each Lender its Revolving Credit Percentage of any portion
of such payment related to the Revolving Credit Loans or its applicable Term
Percentage of any portion of such payment relating to any of the Term Loans. Any
payment received by the Administrative Agent later than

                                       63

<PAGE>

2:00 p.m. shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day
and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

                  (b)      Whenever any payment is due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the preceding Business Day or, in
the event such payment cannot be made on such preceding Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day, and such shortening or lengthening of time shall in
such case be reflected in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may
be.

                  (c)      Unless the Company or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Company or such Lender, as the case
may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Company or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may
(but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that
such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds, then:

                  (i)      if the Company failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
         portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender
         in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
         respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
         available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such
         amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
         funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                 (ii)      if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by
         the Administrative Agent to the Company to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "COMPENSATION PERIOD") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loans included in the
         applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Company, and the Company
         shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with
         interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
         to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing
         herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
         fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
         Administrative Agent or the Company may have against any Lender as a
         result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the
Company with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.

                  (d)      If any Lender makes available to the Administrative
Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and

                                       64

<PAGE>

 such funds are not made available to the Company by the Administrative Agent
 because the conditions to the applicable extension of credit set forth in
 Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the
 Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as
 received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

                  (e)      To the extent that the Administrative Agent receives
funds for application to the amounts owing by the Company under or in respect of
this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies
required to enable the Administrative Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into Euros or from
Dollars to Euros or from a Euro to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent
necessary to enable the Administrative Agent to distribute such funds in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that the Company and each
of the Lenders hereby agree that the Administrative Agent shall not be liable or
responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by the Company or such Lender
as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies affected pursuant to
this Section 2.12(e) or as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent
to effect any such conversion or exchange; and provided further that the Company
agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and hold the
Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any conversion
or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies)
in accordance with this Section 2.12(e).

                  (f)      The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans are
several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any
such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other
Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or
purchase its participation.

                  (g)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender
to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to
constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained the funds for any
Loan in any particular place or manner.

                  Section 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If, other than as
expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the
Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swingline Loans
held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other
share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify
the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders
such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in
the participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans held by them, as the
case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may
be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any
of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such
purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor,

                                       65

<PAGE>

together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according
to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment
to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Company
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 11.9) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Company in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep
records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error)
of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a
participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have
the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other
communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the
Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were
the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

                                   ARTICLE III

                             THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

                  Section 3.1. The Letter of Credit Subfacility. (a) Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof: (i) the Issuing Lender agrees, in reliance upon
the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Article III, (A) from time
to time on any Business Day during the period from the Time of Merger to the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the
Company, and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in
accordance with Section 3.2, and (B) to honor drawings which comply with the
terms of the Letters of Credit Issued by it; and (ii) the Revolving Credit
Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit Issued for the
account of the Company; provided that the Issuing Lender shall not be obligated
to Issue, and no Revolving Credit Lender shall be obligated to participate in,
any Letter of Credit if as of the date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit (the
"ISSUANCE DATE") (1) the sum of the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations,
Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans exceeds the lesser of (y) the
aggregate amount of all Revolving Credit Commitments and (z) the Borrowing Base,
(2) the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the amount of the L/C
Commitment or (3) any Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of
the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations plus such Lender's Revolving Credit
Percentage of the Effective Amount of all Swingline Loans plus the aggregate
Effective Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans owed to such Lender shall exceed
the lesser of (y) such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment and
(z) such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the Borrowing Base. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Company's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and,
accordingly, the Company may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of
Credit to replace Letters of Credit which have expired or which have been drawn
upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been
issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Time of Merger shall be subject
to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

                  (b)      The Issuing Lender shall not Issue any Letter of
         Credit if:

                  (i)      any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
         Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
         restrain the Issuing Lender from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
         Requirement of Law applicable to the Issuing Lender or any request or
         directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
         Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall
         prohibit, or request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the Issuance
         of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular
         or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of
         Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the
         Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on
         the date of this Agreement, or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender any
         unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the date
         of this Agreement and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems
         material to it;

                  (ii)     the Issuing Lender has received written notice from
         any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Company, on or prior to the
         Business Day prior to the requested date of Issuance of such Letter of
         Credit, that one or more of the applicable conditions contained in
         Article V is not then satisfied;

                  (iii)    subject to Section 3.2(c) the expiry date of such
         requested Letter of Credit would occur more than 12 months after the
         date of issuance or last renewal, unless the Required Revolving Credit
         Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                  (iv)     the expiry date of such Letter of Credit is less than
         the fifth Business Day prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date,
         unless all of the Revolving Credit Lenders have approved such expiry
         date in writing;

                  (v)      such Letter of Credit does not provide for drafts, or
         is not otherwise in form and substance acceptable to the Issuing
         Lender, or the Issuance of such Letter of Credit shall violate any
         applicable policies of the Issuing Lender; or

                  (vi)     except to the extent set forth in Section 3.10, such
         Letter of Credit is denominated in a currency other than Dollars.

                  (c)      The Issuing Lender shall be under no obligation to
amend any Letter of Credit if (i) the Issuing Lender would have no obligation at
such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms
hereof, or (ii) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the
prepared amendment to such Letter of Credit.

                  Section 3.2. Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters
of Credit: Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit. (a) Each Letter of Credit shall be
issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Company delivered
to the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a
L/C Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of
the Company. Such L/C Application must be received by the Issuing Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or
such later date and time as the Issuing Lender may agree in a particular
instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of
amendment, as the case may be. In

                                       67

<PAGE>

the case of a request for an initial Issuance of a Letter of Credit, such L/C
Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Lender:
(i) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be
a Business Day); (ii) the amount thereof; (iii) the expiry date thereof; (iv)
the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be
presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full
text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any
drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as the Issuing Lender may
require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of
Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
the Issuing Lender (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed
date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of
the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as the Issuing Lender may
require.

                  (b)      Promptly after receipt of any L/C Application, the
Issuing Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such L/C
Application from the Company and, if not, the Issuing Lender will provide the
Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the Issuing Lender of
confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested Issuance or
amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date,
Issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Company or enter into the
applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the
Issuing Lender's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the
Issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a
risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of
such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage multiplied by the amount of such
Letter of Credit.

                  (c)      If the Company so requests in any applicable L/C
Application, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree
to Issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an
"AUTO-RENEWAL LETTER OF CREDIT"); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of
Credit must permit the Issuing Lender to prevent any such renewal at least once
in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter
of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a
day (the "NONRENEWAL NOTICE DATE") in each such twelve-month period to be agreed
upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued and; provided further, that the
expiry date of such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit shall not be later than the
fifth Business Day occurring prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date unless
all of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall have approved such expiry date in
writing. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Lender, the Company shall not
be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Lender for any such
renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been Issued, the Lenders
shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Lender to
permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not
later than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date; provided, however, that the
Issuing Lender shall not permit any such renewal if (i) the Issuing Lender has
determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of
Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions
of Section 3.1(b) or otherwise), or (ii) it has received notice (which may be by
telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is two Business Days before
the Nonrenewal Notice Date (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Required
Revolving Credit Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or (B) from the
Administrative Agent, any

                                       68

<PAGE>

Lender or the Company that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 5.3 is not then satisfied.

                  (d)      Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit
or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto
or to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender will also deliver to the
Company and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of
Credit or amendment.

                  Section 3.3. Risk Participations, Drawings and Reimbursements.
(a) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the
Company and the Administrative Agent. The Company shall reimburse the Issuing
Lender not later than 3:00 p.m. on each date that any amount is paid by the
Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit to the extent it has received notice
that such payment is to be made by 1:00 p.m. on such date or, in the event such
notice is received after 1:00 p.m. on such date, by no later than 12:00 p.m. on
the next succeeding Business Day, (each such date, an "HONOR DATE") in an
amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Lender. If the Company fails
to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the full amount of any drawing under any
Letter of Credit by the relevant time on the Honor Date, the Administrative
Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the relevant Honor
Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing, and the amounts of such Lender's
Revolving Credit Percentage thereof. In such event, the Company shall be deemed
to have requested that Base Rate Loans be made by the Revolving Credit Lenders
to be disbursed on the relevant Honor Date in an amount equal to the
unreimbursed amount under such Letter of Credit, without regard to the minimum
and multiples specified in Section 2.3 for the principal amount of Base Rate
Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving
Credit Commitments and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.3 other
than Section 5.3(c). Any notice given by the Issuing Lender or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) may be oral if immediately
confirmed in writing (including by facsimile); provided that the lack of such an
immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of
such notice.

                 (b)       Each Revolving Credit Lender (including the Revolving
Credit Lender acting as Issuing Lender) shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 3.3(a) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Issuing Lender at the Agent's Payment Office in an amount equal to its
Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount of the drawing, not later than 1:00
p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
whereupon the participating Revolving Credit Lenders shall (subject to Section
3.3(c)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan consisting of a Base
Rate Loan to the Company in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit
the funds so received to the Issuing Lender.

                  (c)      With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not
converted into Revolving Credit Loans consisting of Base Rate Loans in whole or
in part, because of the Company's failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 5.3 (other than Section 5.3(c), which need not be satisfied) or for any
other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing
Lender an L/C Borrowing in the amount of such drawing, which L/C Borrowing shall
be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at
a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin then in
effect for Base Rate

                                       69

<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Loans plus 2% per annum. In such event, each Revolving Credit
Lender's payment to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(b) shall be
deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Credit Lender in satisfaction of
its participation obligation under this Section 3.3.

                  (d)      Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its
Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3 to reimburse
the Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in
respect of such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of such amount shall be
solely for the account of the Issuing Lender.

                  (e)      Each Revolving Credit Lender's obligation in
accordance with this Agreement to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances,
as contemplated by this Section 3.3, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of
Credit, shall be absolute and unconditional and without recourse to the Issuing
Lender and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit
Lender may have against the Issuing Lender, the Company or any other Person for
any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, Event of
Default or any event that has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any other circumstance, happening or
event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that
each Revolving Credit Lender's obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans under
this Section 3.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.3 (other
than Section 5.3(c), which need not be satisfied). No such revolving of an L/C
Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to
reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing
Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

                  (f)      If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender any
amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3 by the time specified in Section
3.3(b), the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving
Credit Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount
with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to
the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender at
a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A
certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender
(through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
Section 3.3(f) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  Section 3.4. Repayment of Participations. (a) Upon (and only
 upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender
 of immediately available funds from the Company (i) in reimbursement of any
 payment made by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit with respect to
 which any Revolving Credit Lender has paid the Administrative Agent for the
 account of the Issuing Lender for such Revolving Credit Lender's participation
 in such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 3.3 or (ii) in payment of interest
 thereon (whether directly from the Company or otherwise, including proceeds of
 Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the
 Administrative Agent will pay to each Revolving Credit Lender, in like funds as
 those received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
 Lender, the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit
 Percentage of

                                       70

<PAGE>

 such funds (appropriately adjusted, in the case of payment of interest, to
 reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Credit Lender's L/C
 Advance was outstanding), and the Issuing Lender shall receive the amount of
 the Revolving Credit Percentage of such funds of any Revolving Credit Lender
 that did not so pay the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
 Lender.

                  (b)      If any payment received by the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(a) is required to
be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.6 (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Lender in its
discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Issuing Lender its Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on
demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such
demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Credit Lender, at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

                  Section 3.5. Role of the Issuing Lender Each Revolving Credit
Lender and the Company agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any
document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly
required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity
or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or
delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Lender, any Agent-Related
Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of
the Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender for (a) any action taken or
omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the
Lenders, the Required Lenders or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as
applicable; (b) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence
or willful misconduct; or (c) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or
L/C Application. The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions
of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of
Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall
not, preclude the Company's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have
against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None
of the Issuing Lender, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective
correspondents, participants or assignees of the Issuing Lender shall be liable
or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 3.6; provided,
however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company may have a claim against the Issuing Lender, and the Issuing Lender may
be liable to the Company, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct,
as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which
the Company proves were caused by the Issuing Lender's willful misconduct or
gross negligence or the Issuing Lender's willful failure to pay under any.
Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight
draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a
Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order,
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for
the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

                  Section 3.6. Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the
Company under this Agreement and any L/C-Related Document to reimburse the
Issuing Lender for a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and to repay any L/C
Borrowing and any drawing under a Letter of Credit converted into Revolving
Credit Loans, shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each such other L/C-Related
Document under all circumstances, including the following:

                  (a)      any lack of validity or enforceability of this
         Agreement or any L/C-Related Document;

                  (b)      any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the
         Company in respect of any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or
         waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the
         L/C-Related Documents;

                  (c)      the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right that the Company may have at any time against any beneficiary or
         any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
         beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender
         or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
         transactions contemplated hereby or by the L/C-Related Documents or any
         unrelated transaction;

                  (d)      any draft, demand, certificate or other document
         presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any loss or delay in the
         transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
         drawing under any Letter of Credit;

                  (e)      any payment by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of
         Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment
         made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit to any Person
         purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
         assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
         representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of
         any Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any
         Insolvency Proceeding;

                  (f)      any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
         collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
         departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of the
         Company in respect of any Letter of Credit; or

                  (g)      any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
         circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
         a discharge of, the Company or a guarantor.

 The Company shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each
 amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
 noncompliance with the Company's instructions or other irregularity, the
 Company will immediately notify the Issuing

                                       72

<PAGE>

Lender. The Company shall have conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim
against the Issuing Lender and its correspondents unless such notice is given as
aforesaid.

                  Section 3.7. Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, (a) if the Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial
drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an
L/C Borrowing, or (b) if, as of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, any Letter
of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn,
the Company shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Effective Amount of
all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to 105% of the Effective Amount
determined as of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date, as the case may be). For purposes hereof, "CASH COLLATERALIZE" means to
pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of
the Issuing Lender and the Revolving Credit Lenders, as collateral for the L/C
Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form
and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Issuing Lender (which
documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have
corresponding meanings. The Company hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, for
the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Revolving Credit Lenders, a security
interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all
proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral shall be maintained in blocked,
non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. If at any time the
Collateral Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject
to any right or claim of any Person other than the Collateral Agent or that the
total amount of such funds is less than 105% of the aggregate Effective Amount
of all L/C Obligations, the Company will, forthwith upon demand by the
Collateral Agent, pay to the Collateral Agent, as additional funds to be
deposited and held in the deposit accounts at Bank of America as aforesaid, an
amount equal to the excess of (i) 105% of such aggregate Effective Amount over
(ii) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the
Collateral Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim.
Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash
Collateral, such fluids shall be applied, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, to reimburse the Issuing Lender.

                  Section 3.8. Letter of Credit Fees. (a) The Company shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in
accordance with its Revolving Credit Percentage a Letter of Credit fee for each
Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Percentage for the relevant Letter of
Credit as in effect from time to time multiplied by the daily maximum amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum
amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit). Such Letter of Credit
fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit
fees shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each January, April,
July and October, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance or such Letter of Credit, on the relevant expiration date for such
Letter of Credit and thereafter on demand; provided that during the existence of
any Event of Default, the Letter of Credit fees set forth in this Section 3.8(a)
shall be increased by 2% per annum. If there is any change in the Applicable
Percentage during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit
shall be computed and multiplied by such Applicable Percentage separately for
each period during such quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in effect.

                                       73

<PAGE>

                  (b)      The Company shall pay to the Issuing Lender a letter
of credit fronting fee for each Letter of Credit Issued equal to 0.25% per annum
of the daily maximum amount available to be drawn on such Letter of Credit,
computed for each day such Letter of Credit is outstanding, on the last Business
Day of each fiscal quarter and on the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date (or
such later date on which such Letter of Credit shall expire or be fully drawn).

                  (c)      The letter of credit fees payable under Section
3.8(a) and the fronting fees payable under Section 3.8(b) shall be due and
payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each January, April,
July and October, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof during which Letters of Credit are outstanding to the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date (or such later date upon which all outstanding Letters of Credit
shall expire or be fully drawn), with the final payment to be made on the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or such later date). For purposes of calculating
the fees payable under Section 3.8(a) and Section 3.8(b), any undrawn Commercial
Letter of Credit shall be considered outstanding and available to be drawn upon
for 15 days after its expiry date.

                  (d)      The Company shall pay to the Issuing Lender from time
to time on demand the normal issuance, payment, amendment and other processing
fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Lender relating to
letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and
standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

                  Section 3.9. Applicability of ISP98 and UCP; Conflict with L/C
Application, (a) Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Lender and the
Company when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement
applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the "International
Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of International Banking Law
& Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of
issuance) shall apply to each Standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of
the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently
published by the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of
issuance (including the ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking
Technique and Practice on April 6,1998 regarding the European single currency
(euro)) shall apply to each Commercial Letter of Credit.

                  (b)      In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof
and the terms of any L/C Application, the terms hereof shall control.

                 Section 3.10. Non-Dollar Letters of Credit. The Company, the
 Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and all of the Lenders (a) agree that,
 upon the request of the Company, the Issuing Lender may (in its sole
 discretion) issue Letters of Credit ("NON-DOLLAR LETTERS OF CREDIT") in
 currencies other than Dollars and (b) further agree as follows with respect to
 such Non-Dollar Letters of Credit:

                  (i)      The Company agrees that its reimbursement obligation
         under Section 3.3(a) and any resulting L/C Borrowing in each case in
         respect of a drawing under any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit, (i) shall
         be payable in Dollars at the Dollar Equivalent of such obligation in
         the currency in which such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit was issued
         (determined on the date of payment) and (ii) shall bear interest at a
         rate per

                                       74

<PAGE>

         annum equal to the sum of the Overnight Rate plus the Applicable Rate
         for Eurodollar Rate Revolving Credit Loans plus 3% for each day from
         and including the Honor Date to but excluding the date such obligation
         is paid in full; provided that any payment received after 3:00
         p.m. on any day shall be deemed received on the following Business Day.

                  (ii)     Each Lender agrees that its obligation to make
         Revolving Credit Loans under Section 3.3(a) and to make L/C Advances
         for any unpaid reimbursement obligation or L/C Borrowing in respect of
         a drawing under any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit shall be payable in
         Dollars at the Dollar Equivalent of such obligation in the currency in
         which such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit was issued (calculated on the
         date of payment) (and any such amount which is not paid when due shall
         bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate plus,
         beginning on the third Business Day after such amount was due, the
         Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate Revolving Credit Loans as in effect
         from time to time).

                  (iii)    For purposes of determining whether there is
         availability for the Company to request, continue or convert any Loan,
         or request, extend or increase the face amount of any Letter of Credit,
         the Dollar Equivalent of the Effective Amount of each Non-Dollar Letter
         of Credit shall be calculated on the date such Loan is to be made,
         continued or converted or such Letter of Credit is to be issued,
         extended or increased.

                  (iv)     For purposes of determining (A) the amount of the
         unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments under Section
         2.10(c),(B) the letter of credit fee under Section 3.8(a) and (C) the
         letter of credit fronting fee under Section 3.8(b\ the Dollar
         Equivalent of the Effective Amount of any Non-Dollar Letter of Credit
         shall be determined on each of (1) the date of an issuance, extension
         or change in the stated amount of such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit, (2)
         the date of any payment by the Issuing Lender in respect of a drawing
         under such Non-Dollar Letter of Credit, (3) the last day of each
         calendar month and (4) each day on which the aggregate amount of the
         Revolving Credit Commitments and/or L/C Commitment is reduced.

                  (v)      If, on the last day of any calendar month or any day
         on which the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments
         and/or L/C Commitment is reduced, the sum of the Effective Amount of
         all Revolving Credit Loans plus the Effective Amount of all Letters of
         Credit plus the Effective Amount of all Swingline Loans (valuing the
         Effective Amount of, and all reimbursement obligations and L/C
         Borrowings of the Company in respect of, any Non-Dollar Letter of
         Credit at the Dollar Equivalent thereof as of such day) would exceed
         the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments, then the
         Company will immediately eliminate such excess by prepaying Revolving
         Credit Loans or Swingline Loans and/or causing one or more Letters of
         Credit to be reduced or terminated.

                  (vi)     If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
         court, it is necessary to convert a sum due in respect of any
         Non-Dollar Letter of Credit in one currency into another currency, the
         rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
         banking procedures the Issuing Lender could purchase the first currency
         with

                                       75

<PAGE>

         such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final
         judgment is given. The obligation of the Company in respect of any such
         sum due from it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any
         Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the
         "JUDGMENT CURRENCY")other than that in which such sum is denominated in
         accordance with the applicable provisions of the applicable Non- Dollar
         Letter of Credit (the "AGREEMENT CURRENCY"), be discharged only to the
         extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Issuing Lender
         of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Issuing
         Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the
         Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the
         Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to
         the Issuing Lender in the Agreement Currency, the Company agrees, as a
         separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify
         the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Lender to whom such
         obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement
         Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the
         Issuing Lender in such currency, the Issuing Lender agrees to return
         the amount of any excess to the Company (or to any other Person who may
         be entitled thereto under applicable law).

                  (vii)    For purposes of this Section "OVERNIGHT RATE" means,
         for any day, the rate of interest per annum at which overnight deposits
         in the applicable currency, in an amount approximately equal to the
         amount with respect to which such rate is being determined, would be
         offered for such day by the London Branch of Bank of America to major
         banks in the London or other applicable offshore interbank market. The
         Overnight Rate for any day which is not a Business Day (or on which
         dealings are not carried on in the applicable offshore interbank
         market) shall be the Overnight Rate for the immediately preceding
         Business Day.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

                  Section 4.1. Taxes. (a) Unless otherwise required by law, any
and all payments by any Loan Party to or for the account of any Agent or Lender
under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Agent and Lender, taxes imposed
on or measured by its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in
lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision
thereof) under the laws of which such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a Lending Office (all such nonexcluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES") and all such excluded
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fee, withholding or
similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "EXCLUDED
TAXES"). If any Loan Party shall be required by any law to deduct any Taxes from
or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Agent or Lender,
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an
amount equal to the

                                       76

<PAGE>

sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the relevant
Loan Party shall make such deductions, (iii) the relevant Loan Party shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
in accordance with applicable laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of
such payment, the relevant Loan Party, as the case may be, shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to the relevant Agent or
Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof
or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (b)      In addition, the Company agrees to and to cause each
other Loan Party (other than DMFC) to pay any and all present or future stamp,
court, intangible, mortgage recording or documentary taxes and any other excise
or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance,
enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document
(hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

                  (c)      If any Loan Party shall be required to deduct or pay
any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan
Document to any Agent or Lender, such Loan Party shall also pay to the relevant
Agent or Lender, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that such
Agent or Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after
factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income)
that such Agent or Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had
not been imposed.

                  (d)      The Company agrees to indemnify each Agent and Lender
for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section) paid by such Agent or Lender, (ii) amounts payable under Section 4.
l(c) and (iii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or
not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this Section 4.1(d) shall be
made within 30 days after the date any Agent or Lender makes a demand therefor.

                  (e)      If the Company is required to pay additional amounts
to any Lender or any Agent pursuant to this Section 4.1, then such Lender or
Agent shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with internal policy and legal
and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so
as to reduce or eliminate any such additional payment by the Company which may
thereafter accrue, if such change in the good faith judgment of such Lender or
Agent is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender or Agent.

                  (f)      If the Company pays any additional amounts in respect
of any Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 4.1 which results in any
Lender or Agent actually receiving from the taxing authority imposing such Taxes
or Other Taxes a refund of such Taxes or Other Taxes, such Lender shall within
90 days of receipt of such refund pay to the Company an amount equal to the
amount of such refund actually received by such Lender or Agent and reasonably
attributable to Taxes or Other Taxes that have been paid by the Company under
this Section 4.1 with respect to such refund, net of all out of pocket expenses,
and without any interest; provided that each Lender or Agent shall only be
required to pay to the Company such amounts as such

                                       77

<PAGE>

Lender or Agent, as the case may be, in its good faith judgment, determines are
attributable to taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Company.

                  (g)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Company hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the
agreements and obligations of the Company contained in this Section 4.1 shall
survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the
Notes.

                  Section 4.2. Illegality. If any Lender determines that any law
has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or
fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent,
any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, or to convert Base Rate Loans to
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be
suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Company shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, (a) convert all
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, of such
Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, to such day, or
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, and (b) in
the case of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, redenominated such Eurocurrency Rate
Loan into a Eurodollar Rate B Loan thereof. Upon any such prepayment, conversion
or exchange, the Company shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so
prepaid, converted or redenominated. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  Section 4.3. Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required
Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate or Euribo Rate for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar
Rate Loans, as the case may be, or that the Eurodollar Base Rate or Euribo Rate,
as the case may be, for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify
the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make
or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may
be, shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of
the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Company may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

<PAGE>

                  Section 4.4. Increased Cost and Reduced Return: Capital
 Adequacy; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans, (a) If
 any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in
 or in the interpretation of any law occurring after the date hereof, or such
 Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such
 Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate
 Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, or issuing or participating
 in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by
 such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of
 this Section 4.4(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting
 from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 4.1 shall govern), (ii)
 changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income
 by the United States or any other jurisdiction or any political subdivision of
 either thereof under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has its
 Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements utilized in the determination of
 the Eurocurrency Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as the case may be), then from time
 to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
 Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Lender such additional
 amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

                  (b)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any
law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof occurring after the date hereof or compliance by such Lender (or its
Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a
consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration
its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return
on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Lender
such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

                  (c)      This Section 4.4 shall not require the Company to
reimburse any Agent or Lender for any Taxes which are otherwise fully covered by
the indemnity set forth in Section 4.1 or constitute Excluded Taxes.

                  Section 4.5. Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall
promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss,
cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

                  (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment
         of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b)      any failure by the Company (for a reason other than

         the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue
         or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the
         amount notified by the Company; or

                  (c)      any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or
         Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
         Company pursuant to Section 11.18;

including any loss or expense (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits)
arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds
were obtained. The Company shall also pay any customary administrative fees
charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

                  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to
the Lenders under this Section 4.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded
each Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, made by
it at the Eurodollar Base Rate or Euribo Rate, as the case may be, used in
determining the Eurodollar Rate or Eurocurrency Rate, as the case may be, for
such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank
eurocurrency market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether
or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be,
was in fact so funded.

                  Section 4.6. Matters Applicable to All Requests for
Compensation, (a) Any Lender or Agent claiming reimbursement or compensation
under this Article IV shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such claim and a calculation of the amount payable to such Lender or Agent
and such certificate shall be prima facie evidence thereof. In determining such
amount, any Agent or Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution
methods. The Company shall not be required to make any payment to any Agent or
Lender pursuant to this Section 4.6 which is attributable to any period of time
occurring more than 180 days prior to the date of any certificate described in
the first sentence of this Section 4.6 delivered by such Lender or Agent to the
Company; provided that if the event or circumstance giving rise to any such
payment is retroactive, the 180-day period referred to above will be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect of the event or circumstance giving
rise to such payment.

                  (b)      Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation
under Section 4.1. or Section 4.4, or upon the occurrence of the circumstances
described in Section 4.2 with respect to such Lender, the Company may replace
such Lender in accordance with Section 11.18.

                  (c)      Each Lender and Agent agrees to use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to mitigate any amounts that would otherwise be payable by the
Company pursuant to this Article IV; provided that no Lender or Agent shall
required to take any action or step which would in the good faith judgment of
such Agent or Lender be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or Agent.

                  Section 4.7. Survival. All of the Company's and DMFC's
obligations under this Article IV shall survive termination of the Commitments
and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

         freely to transfer or otherwise dispose of, or to create any Lien on,

                  (j)      After giving effect to the Transactions, there shall

         maturity or require that the Company or any other Loan Party repurchase
         or redeem any such Subordinated Debt in advance of its regularly
         scheduled maturity.

                  Section 5.3. Conditions to All Credit Extensions. The

         under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct
         in all material respects on and as of the date of such credit extension

         such earlier date.

                  (b)      No Default or Event of Default shall exist, or would
         result from the making of such Loan or the Issuance of such Letter of
         Credit from the application of the proceeds therefrom; provided that
         with respect to the Borrowings to be made on or prior to the Time of

         and Swingline Loans does not exceed the Borrowing Base at such time
         after giving effect to the making of such Loan or the Issuance of such

Sections 5.3(a) and 5.3(b) have been satisfied on and as of the date of such
notice.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  The Company represents and warrants to each Agent and each

                  (d)      is in compliance with all Requirements of Law;

except, in each case referred to in clause (b)(i), (c) or (d), to the extent

execution and delivery by each Loan Party of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, the Borrowings hereunder, the

         properties are subject; or

                  (c)      violate any Requirement of Law.

                  Section 6.3 Governmental Authorization. No approval, consent,

and Requirements of Law.

other Transaction Document, when delivered hereunder, will have been, duly
executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is party thereto. This Agreement

enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as

laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable
principles relating to enforceability.

proceedings, claims or disputes pending or, to the best of its knowledge,
threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in arbitration or before any

or pertain to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any of the
transactions

                                       88

<PAGE>

contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the
Transactions), or (b) except for Disclosed Litigation, either individually or in
the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and there has been no adverse change in the status or financial effect on any
Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries, of the Disclosed Litigation.
No injunction, writ, temporary restraining order or other order of any nature
has been issued by any court or other Governmental Authority purporting to
enjoin or restrain the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document, or directing that the transactions provided for
herein or therein not be consummated as herein or therein provided.

                  Section 6.6. No Default. No Default or Event of Default exists

disclosed in Schedule 6.7, each Plan is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state
law. To its best knowledge, nothing has occurred which would cause any Plan
which is intended to qualify under Section 401 (a) of the Code to fail to be so
qualified. Each of the Loan Parties and each of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has made all required contributions to any Plan subject to Section
412 of the Code, and no application for a funding waiver or an extension of any
amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made within the
last five years with respect to any Plan.

                  (b)      Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 6.7,
there are no pending or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened claims,
actions or lawsuits, or actions by any Governmental Authority, with respect to
any Plan which has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation
of the fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan which has
resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

expected to occur that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; (ii) no contribution failure has occurred with respect to a Pension Plan

except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 6.7, neither any Loan Party nor any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, or reasonably expects to
incur, any material liability to the PBGC under Title IV of ERISA with respect
to any Pension Plan.

                  Section 6.8. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. The proceeds
of the Loans are to be used solely for the purposes set forth in and permitted
by Sections 7.13 and 8.7. No Loan Party is generally engaged in the business of

record and marketable title in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in,
all real property necessary or

                                       89

<PAGE>

used in the ordinary conduct of its businesses, except for such defects in title
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries has good title to all their other
respective material properties and assets (except for those assets disposed of
not in violation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and except for
encumbrances and title defects that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect).

                  (b)      Set forth on Schedule 6.9 is a complete and accurate
list of all Liens on the property or assets of each Loan Party (other than
Heinz) showing as of the date hereof the lienholder thereof, the principal
amount of the obligations secured thereby and the property or assets of such
Loan Party other than with respect to any Lien, the existence of which would not
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The property of each
Loan Party (other than Heinz) is not subject to any Liens, other than Liens set
forth on Schedule 6.9 and as otherwise permitted by Section 8.1.

                  Section 6.10. Taxes. Each Loan Party and each of their
respective Subsidiaries has filed all federal and state income tax returns and
all other material tax returns and reports required to be filed, and have paid
all federal and state income taxes and all other material taxes, assessments,
fees and other governmental charges levied or imposed upon them or their
properties, income or assets otherwise due and payable, except those which are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP. There is no proposed tax
assessment against any Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries that
would, if made, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Tax Sharing Agreement and
the Tax Separation Agreement are the only agreements among the Loan Parties
regarding tax sharing, tax reimbursement or tax indemnification. The
consummation of the Transactions will not be taxable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

         its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and results of operations for
         the periods covered thereby; and

         contingent, of DMFC and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof,
         including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and Contingent
         Obligations, to the extent required by GAAP to be shown on such
         financial statements.

                  (b)      Since June 30, 2002, on a pro forma basis, after
giving effect to the Transactions, there has been no event or circumstance,
either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Businesses for the corresponding periods delivered to the Agents and the Lenders
pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(xiii):

                  (i)      were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
         applied throughout the periods covered thereby, except as otherwise
         expressly noted therein;

                  (ii)     present fairly in all material respects the financial
         condition of the Businesses as of the dates thereof and the results of
         operations for the periods covered thereby; and

                  (iii)    show all material indebtedness and other liabilities,
         direct or contingent, of the Businesses as of the date thereof,
         including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and Contingent
         Obligations, to the extent required by GAAP to be shown on such
         financial statements.

                  (d)      The pro forma forecasted balance sheets, statements
of income and statements of cash flows of the Company (after giving effect to
the Merger) and its Subsidiaries delivered to the Agents and Lenders pursuant to
Section 5.2(a)(xii) were prepared in good faith by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the basis of information and assumptions that the Company and
its senior management believed to be reasonable as of the date of such
projections and such assumptions are reasonable as of the Initial Distribution
Date; provided that it is understood that projections are subject to significant
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control,
and that no assurance can be given that the projections will be realized.

                  Section 6.12. Regulated Entities. Neither any Loan Party nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Neither any Loan Party nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act,
any state public utilities code or any other Federal or state statute or
regulation limiting its ability to incur Indebtedness.

                  Section 6.13. No Burdensome Restrictions. Neither any Loan
Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
Contractual Obligation or subject to any restriction in any Organization
Document or any Requirement of Law which would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 6.14. Copyrights. Patents, Trademarks and Licenses.
Etc. Each Loan Party and their respective Subsidiaries own or are licensed or
otherwise have the right to use all of the patents, trademarks, service marks,
trade names, copyrights, trade secrets and other similar rights (collectively,
"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY") that are necessary for the operation of their
respective businesses, without conflict with the rights of any other Person
except for Intellectual Property the failure of which to own or be licensed or
otherwise have the right to use, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All of such Intellectual
Property is subsisting, valid and enforceable, except to the extent

                                       91

<PAGE>

that the failure to be subsisting, valid and enforceable would not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except to the extent set forth on
Schedule 6.14, there is no individual item of Intellectual Property the loss of
which would reasonably by expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
best of its knowledge, no slogan or other advertising device, product, process,
method, substance, part or other material now employed, or now contemplated to
be employed, by any Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries infringes
upon any rights held by any other Person except for any infringement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as specifically disclosed on Schedule 6.5. no claim or
litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending or, to its knowledge,
threatened against any Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and
no patent, invention, device, application, principle or any statute, law, rule,
regulation, standard or code, relating in each case to Intellectual Property,
is, to its knowledge, pending or proposed, which, in either case, would
reasonably by expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 6.15. Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, each Loan
Party has no Subsidiaries other than those specifically disclosed in part(a) of
Schedule 6.15 and all of the outstanding Equity Interests in such Subsidiaries
have been validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by a
Loan Party in the amounts specified on part (a) of Schedule 6.15 free and clear
of all Liens, other than Liens created or permitted by the Loan Documents. Each
Loan Party has no equity investments in any other Person other than those
specifically disclosed in part (b) of Schedule 6.15. The only Material
Subsidiaries of the Company are those identifies on part (c) of Schedule 6.15
and such other Subsidiaries of the Company as have executed and delivered a
guaranty or guaranty supplement and security agreement or security agreement
supplement in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.14 or 7.15 after the
date hereof. Neither or Marine Trading Pacific, Inc. nor Star-Kist Mauritius,
Inc. is a Material Subsidiary of the Company of DMFC (collectively, the
"NON-MATERIAL SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS").

                  Section 6.16. Insurance. Except as specifically disclosed on
Schedule 6.16, the properties of each of the Loan Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies not Affiliates of any of the Loan Parties, in such amounts, with such

engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where
such Loan Party or Subsidiary operates.

                  Section 6.17. Solvency, Etc. As of the date hereof (or, in the

         subordinated, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
         Agent, to such Subsidiary's Guaranty Obligation with respect to the
         Obligations to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to
         the Obligations; provided that such Subsidiary's Guaranty Obligation of
         such Indebtedness of the Company shall be subordinated to the full
         amount of such Subsidiary's Guaranty

         under Section 11.4 and amounts payable under Article IV), ratably among
         them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause second
         payable to them;

                  third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations
         constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and L/C
         Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective
         amounts described in this clause third payable to them;

                  fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations
         constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably
         among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in
         this clause fourth held by them;

                  fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         Issuing Lender, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations
         in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters
         of Credit; and

         been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Company or as otherwise required
         by law.

Subject to Section 3.3, amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn
amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause fifth above shall be applied to
satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount
remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either
been fully drawn, cancelled, terminated or expired, such remaining amount shall
be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

                  Section 9.4. Rights Not Exclusive. The rights provided for in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any other rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in
equity, or under any other instrument, document or agreement now existing or
hereafter arising.

                                   THE AGENTS

                  Section 10.1. Appointment and Authorization. (a) Each Lender
(in its capacity as a Lender, Swingline Lender (if applicable), Issuing Lender
(if applicable) and a potential hedge counterparty) hereby irrevocably (subject
to Section 10.9) appoints, designates and authorizes Bank of America as the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders or Secured Parties as
the case may be, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform
such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Lender hereby further appoints JPMorgan Chase as Syndication Agent
for the Lenders and Morgan Stanley and UBS, as Co-Documentation Agents for the
Lenders. The Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents, in their
respective capacities as such, shall have no rights or duties hereunder or under
any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement and in the
other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or
express) obligation arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended
to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

                  (b)      The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders
with respect to any Letters of Credit Issued by it and the documents associated
therewith, and the Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities
(i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any
acts taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Lender in connection with
Letters of Credit Issued by it or proposed to be Issued by it and the
applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the Letters of
Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent", as used in this Article X
and in the definition of "Agent-Related Person" included the Issuing Lender with
respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as additionally provided in this
Agreement with respect to the Issuing Lender.

                  Section 10.2. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent may execute any of their duties under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien
on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral
Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies thereunder) by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be
responsible for the negligence

                                      126

<PAGE>

or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  Section 10.3. Liability of Agents. None of the Agent-Related
Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein) or
(b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary
or Affiliate thereof, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in
any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent
or the Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the existence,
creation, validity, attachment, perfection, enforceability, value or sufficiency
of any collateral security for the Obligations or for any failure of the Company
or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender
or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of
any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan
Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

                  Section 10.4. Reliance by Agents. (a) The Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution,
representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so
requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater
number of Lenders or may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all of the Lenders.

                  (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the
conditions specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this Agreement
shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied
with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Initial
Distribution Date specifying its objection thereto.

                  Section 10.5. Notice of Default. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default except, in the case of the
Administrative Agent, with respect to defaults in the payment of principal,
interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,
as the case may be, shall have received written notice from a Lender or the
Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default
and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". Each of the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be directed by the Required
Lenders in accordance with Article IX; provided, however, that unless and until
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, has
received any such direction, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,
as the case may be, may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

                  Section 10.6. Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by
Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related
Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent hereafter taken, including any
consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan
Party and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any
matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material
information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative
Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and all applicable bank or other
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company
and the other Loan Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Administrative Agent, or the Collateral Agent, as the case may
be, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any Loan Party and their respective
Affiliates which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related
Persons.

                  Section 10.7. Indemnification of Agents. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand the Agents and the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor and without limiting
the obligation of the Company or any such Guarantor to do

                                      128

<PAGE>

so), pro rata, and hold harmless the Agents and the Agent-Related Persons from
and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Agents or the
Agent-Related Persons in their capacities as such; provided, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent or Agent-Related Person of
any portion of the Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent's or such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct; provided further, however, that no action taken in accordance with
the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. In the case of
any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified
Liabilities, this Section 10.7 applies whether any such investigation,
litigation or proceeding is brought by an Lender or any other Person. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse each Agent upon demand
for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney
Costs) incurred by such Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that such Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Company. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of any Agent.

                  Section 10.8. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Harris Bank,
Morgan Stanley and UBS in Their Individual Capacity. Each of Bank of America,
JPMorgan Chase, Harris Bank, Morgan Stanley and UBS and each of their respective
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Loan
Parties and their respective Affiliates as though Bank of America, JPMorgan
Chase, Harris Bank, Morgan Stanley or UBS, as the case may be, were not an Agent
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, each of Bank of America, JPMorgan
Chase, Harris Bank, Morgan Stanley or UBS or any of their respective Affiliates
may receive information regarding the Loan Parties or their respective
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of the Loan Parties or such Affiliates) and acknowledge
that no Agent shall be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
With respect to its Loans, each of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Harris Bank,
Morgan Stanley or UBS or any of their respective Affiliates shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender Parties and may
exercise such rights and powers as though, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Harris Bank, Morgan Stanley and UBS
even in its individual capacity.

                  Section 10.9. Successor Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall,
resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the
Company; provided that any such resignation by Bank of America shall also
constitute a resignation as Collateral Agent, Issuing Lender and Swingline
Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Lenders shall, with the consent of the Company so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the
Lenders. If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the

                                      129

<PAGE>

effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Company, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such
successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Lender
and Swingline Lender and the respective terms "Administrative Agent",
"Collateral Agent", "Issuing Lender" and "Swingline Lender" shall mean such
successor administrative agent, collateral agent, Letter of Credit issuer and
swing line lender, and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers
and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated and the retiring
Collateral Agent's, Issuing Lender's and Swingline Lender's rights, powers and
duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on
the part of such retiring Collateral Agent, Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender
or any other Lender, other than the obligation of the successor Issuing Lender
to issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any,
outstanding at the time of such succession or to make other arrangements
satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the
obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of
Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X and Sections 11.4 and
11.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor
agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30
days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

                  Section 10.10. Collateral Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In
case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Collateral Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Collateral Agent shall have made any demand on the Company) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

                  (a)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to
         file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
         have the claims of the Lenders and the Collateral Agent (including any
         claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
         advances of the Lenders and the Collateral Agent and their respective
         agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
         Collateral Agent under Sections 2.10, 3.8 and 11.4) allowed in such
         judicial proceeding; and

                  (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the

                                      130

<PAGE>

Collateral Agent and, in the event that the Collateral Agent shall consent to
the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Collateral
Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Collateral Agent under Sections 2.10 and 11.4.

                  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Collateral Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Collateral Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

                  Section 10.11. Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders
irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion,

                  (a)      to release any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon
         termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations
         (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration,
         termination, cancellation or cash collateralization of all Letters of
         Credit, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection
         with any sale permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or
         (iii) subject to, Section 11.1, if approved, authorized or ratified in
         writing by the Required Lenders;

                  (b)      to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of
         any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 8.1(i) or
         8.1(j); and

                  (c)      to release any Material Subsidiary from its
         obligations under any Loan Document to which it is a party if such
         ceases to be a Material Subsidiary of the Company or DMFC as a result
         of a transaction permitted hereunder.

                  Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Required
Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agent's authority to release or
subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release
any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section
10.11.

                  Section 10.12. Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers. None of
the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of
this Agreement as a "syndication agent", "co-documentation agent", "co-agent",
"book manager", "lead manager", "arranger", "lead arranger" or "co-arranger"
shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under
this Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to all
Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other
Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not
rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter
into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to
the applicable address, facsimile number or (subject to clause (c) below)
electronic mail address, and all notices and other communications expressly
permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to the applicable
telephone number, as follows:

                  (i)      if to the Company, the Administrative Agent, the
         Collateral Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, to the
         address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number
         specified for such Person on Schedule 11.2 or to such other address,
         facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall
         be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties; and

                  (ii)     if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
         Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
         designated by such party in a notice to the Company, the Administrative
         Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender.

the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after
deposit in the mails (certified or registered), postage prepaid; (C) if

Loan Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness
of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on each
Loan Party, the Agents and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also
require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed
original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the
same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

                  (c)      Electronic Communications. Notices and other
communications to the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline
Lender hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications
(including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures
approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to notices pursuant to Article II or III unless otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender and, to the extent applicable,
Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent or the Company
may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it
hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it;
provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices
or communications.

upon any notices (including telephonic Notices of Borrowing and Notices of
Conversion/Continuation) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Company even
if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete
or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein,

confirmation thereof. The Company shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and
each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the
reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Company. All telephonic notices to and other communications with the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, and each of the parties hereto
hereby consents to such recording.

                  Section 11.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by
any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to exercise, and no
delay by any such Person in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

                  Section 11.4. Costs and Expenses. The Company shall:

                  (a)      whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
         are consummated, pay or reimburse the Agents and the Arrangers and
         their Affiliates (including Bank of America in its capacities as
         Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender) within five Business Days after
         demand therefor (subject to Sections 5.1(b), 5.2(b) and S.2(c)) for all
         reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Agents and
         the Arrangers and their Affiliates in connection with the development,
         preparation, delivery, administration and execution of, and any
         amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in each case, whether
         or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and any other
         document prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
         including Attorney Costs incurred by the Agents and the Arrangers with
         respect thereto; and

                  (b)      pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the
         Collateral Agent and each Lender within five Business Days after demand
         therefor (subject to Sections 5.1(b), 5.2(b) and 5.2(c)) (i) for so
         long as no Insolvency Proceeding with respect to any Loan Party or any
         enforcement action with respect to the Collateral has been commenced,
         the Attorney Costs of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
         and all other costs and expenses incurred by either thereof or any
         Lender (other than any Attorney Costs) or (ii) in the event (A) any
         Insolvency Proceeding has been commenced with respect to any Loan Party
         or (B) any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral has been
         commenced, the Attorney Costs of the Administrative Agent, the
         Collateral Agent and each Lender and all other costs and expenses
         incurred by them in connection, in either case, with the enforcement,
         attempted enforcement or preservation of any right or remedy under this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                                      135

<PAGE>

                  The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search,
filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes
related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent and the cost of independent public accountants and
other outside experts retained by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
or any Lender. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of
the Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

                  Section 11.5. Company Indemnification. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company shall indemnify
and hold the Agent-Related Persons, each Agent and each Lender and each of their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents,
investment advisers, trustees and attorneys-in-fact (each an "INDEMNIFIED
PERSON") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges,
expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature
whatsoever (excluding costs and expenses specifically referred to in Section
11.4) which may at any time (including at any time following repayment of the
Loans, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination, resignation
or replacement of any Agent or replacement of any Lender) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnified Person in any way relating
to or arising out of or in connection with (a) the execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan Document or any other
agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated thereby or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use
of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Lender to honor
a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in
connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter
of Credit), (c) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by any Loan
Party or Affiliate thereof, or any environmental liability related in any way to
any Loan Party or Affiliate thereof, or (d) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation
of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim,
investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any
Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising,
in whole or in part, out of the negligence of any Indemnified Person; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Person, be available to the
extent that such Indemnified Liabilities are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted directly and
primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any damages arising from the
use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks
or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement, nor shall any Indemnified Person have any liability for any indirect
or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether
before or after the date hereof). In the case of an investigation, litigation or
other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 11.5 applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not an
Indemnified Person is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents

                                      136

<PAGE>

are consummated. All amounts due under this Section 11.5 shall be payable within
five Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of any Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the
termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of
all the other Obligations. Each Agent-Related Person and each Lender agrees that
in the event that any investigation, litigation or proceeding is asserted or
threatened in writing or instituted against it or any other Indemnified Person,
or any remedial, removal or response action which is requested of it or any
other Indemnified Person, for which any Agent-Related Person or Lender may
desire indemnity or defense hereunder, such Agent-Related Person or such Lender
shall notify the Company in writing of such event; provided that failure to so
notify the Company shall not affect the right of any Agent-Related Person or
Lender to seek indemnification under this Section.

                  Section 11.6. Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any
payment by or on behalf of the Company is made to any Agent or the Lenders, or
any Agent or the Lenders exercise their right of set-off, and such payment or
the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Agent or Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee or receiver, or any other party, in
connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent
of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
the case may be, upon demand its pro rata share of any amount so recovered from
or repaid by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may
be, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment
is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Fund Rate from time to time in
effect.

                  Section 11.7. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that
the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no
Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions
of Section 11.7(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the
provisions of Section 11.7(d), (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a
security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 11.7(f) or (i) of this
Section, or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.7(h)
of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the
extent provided in 11.7(d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Indemnified Persons) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including
for purposes of this Section 11.7(b), participations in L/C Obligations and in
Swingline Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case

                                      137

<PAGE>

of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment
to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in
Section 11.7(j)) of any Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which
for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such
assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date"
is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not
be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment of any rights or
obligations in respect of any of the Term A Facility or the Revolving Credit
Facility or $1,000,000 or Euro 1,000,000, as applicable, in the case of any
assignment of any rights or obligations in respect of the Term B Facility unless
each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall
be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the
Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in
respect of Swingline Loans; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be
approved by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline
Lender unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender
(whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible
Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.7(c), from and after
the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible
Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 11.4 and 11.5 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring
prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided, however, the Company
shall not as a result of any assignment, delegation or participation by any
Lender, incur any increased liability for Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to
Section 4.1 at the time of such assignment, delegation or participation. Upon
request, the Company (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the
assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.7(d).

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Company, shall maintain at the Agent's Payment Office
a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Company, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the

                                      138

<PAGE>

contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

                  (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of,
or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to
any Person (other than a natural person or the Company or any of the Company's
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Administrative
Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.1 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 4.1,4.4 and 4.5 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a
Lender.

                  (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 4.1 or 4.4 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign
Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.1
unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and
such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section
11.17 as though it were a Lender.

                  (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (g)      As used herein, the following terms have the
following meanings:

                  "ELIGIBLE ASSIGNEE" means (i) a Lender; (ii) an Affiliate of a
         Lender; (iii) an Approved Fund; and (iv) any other Person (other than a
         natural person) approved by (A) the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Lender and the Swingline Lender, and (B) unless an Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing, the Company (each such approval not to be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the

                                      139

<PAGE>

         foregoing, "ELIGIBLE ASSIGNEE" shall not include the Company or any of
         the Company's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

                  "FUND" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
         (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business.

                  "APPROVED FUND" means any Fund that is administered or managed
         by (i) a Lender, (ii) an Affiliate of a Lender or (iii) an entity or an
         Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to a special purpose funding
vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender
to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an "SPC") the option to provide all
or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated
to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall
constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects
not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such
Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the
terms hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any
SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or
expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Company under
this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 4.4), (ii) no SPC shall
be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement
for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all
purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification
of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.
The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that,
prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
without prior consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent and without
paying any processing fee therefor assign all or any portion of its right to
receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of
any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any
portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee
for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security
for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 11.7, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender

                                      140

<PAGE>

under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership
rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

                  Section 11.8. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain, and to cause its
Affiliates to maintain, the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party
to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of
or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such
contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor)
to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of any Loan Party;
(g) with the consent of the Company; (h) to the extent such Information (i)
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or
(ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company; or (i)
to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose
the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market
data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service
providers to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders in
connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the extensions of credit hereunder. For the
purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means all information received from any
Loan Party relating to any Loan Party or their respective businesses, other than
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by
any Loan Party.

                  Section 11.9. Set-off. (a) In addition to any right or remedy
of the Lenders provided by law, if an Event of Default exists, or the Loans have
been accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Loan Party, any such notice being waived by such
Loan Party to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender or any
Affiliate of such Lender to or for the credit or the account of such Loan Party
against any and all Obligations then due and owing to such Lender and each
Affiliate of such Lender and each Lender and Affiliate of such Lender is hereby
irrevocably authorized to permit such set-off and application. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after any
such set-off and application made by such Lender or its Affiliates; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application.

                                      141

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything in clause (a) to the
contrary, if at any time the Obligations shall be secured by real property
located in the State of California, no Lender shall exercise any such right of
set-off or take any other similar action unless such action is taken by the
Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders or approved in writing by the
Collateral Agent or Required Lenders, if the effect of such set-off or other
action would or might (pursuant to Sections 580a, 580b, 580d and 726 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure or Section 2924 of the California Civil Code,
if applicable, or otherwise) affect or impair the validity, priority or
enforceability of the Liens granted to the Secured Parties pursuant to the
Collateral Documents or the enforceability of the notes or any of the other
Obligations, and any attempted exercise by an Lender of any such right without
obtaining such consent of the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders shall be
null and void. This clause (b) shall be solely for the benefit of each of the
Lenders.

                  Section 11.10. Automatic Debits of Fees. With respect to any
commitment fee, arrangement fee, agency fee, letter of credit fee or other fee,
or any other cost or expense (including Attorney Costs) due and payable to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing
Lender under the Loan Documents, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries hereby
irrevocably authorizes Bank of America to debit any deposit account of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with Bank of America in an amount such that
the aggregate amount debited from all such deposit accounts does not exceed such
fee or other cost or expense. If there are insufficient funds in such deposit
accounts to cover the amount of the fee or other cost or expense then due, such
debits will be reversed (in whole or in part, in Bank of America's sole
discretion) and such amount not debited shall be deemed to be unpaid. No such
debit under this Section shall be deemed a set-off.

                  Section 11.11. Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices,
Etc. Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any change
in the address to which notices to such Lender should be directed, of addresses
of any Lending Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be
made to it hereunder and of such other administrative information as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

                  Section 11.12. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or
agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of
non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the "MAXIMUM RATE"). If the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal
of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Company.
In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not
principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

                  Section 11.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be
deemed an original, and all of which taken together shall constitute but one and
the same instrument.

                                      142

<PAGE>

                  Section 11.14. Integration. This Agreement, together with the
other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the
parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan
Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the
inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not
be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with
the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed
neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the
fair meaning thereof.

                  Section 11.15. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Lender, regardless of any
investigation made by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
at the time of any extension of credit hereunder, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

                  Section 11.16. Severability. If any provision of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected
or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with
valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that
of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  Section 11.17. Tax Forms. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a
"United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a
"FOREIGN LENDER") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company,
prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon
accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies
of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign
Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax
on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by any Loan Party pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor
thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Loan
Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document) or such other
evidence satisfactory to the Loan Party and the Administrative Agent and the
Company that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction
of, U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of
the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A)
upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, the Company or any other
Loan Party promptly submit to the Administrative Agent and the Company such
additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such
successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by

                                      143

<PAGE>

the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under
then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent of any available
exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of
all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Loan Party pursuant to
this Agreement and (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction.

                  (ii)     Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid
or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the
case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent and the Company on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases
to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or
payable, and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the
Administrative Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two
duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be provided
by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums
paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that
is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies
of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information
such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or
statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is
not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums
payable to such Lender.

                  (iii)    No Loan Party shall be required to pay any additional
amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 4.1 (A) with respect to any Taxes
required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information,
certificates or statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form
W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.17(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed
to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a); provided that if
such Lender shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.17(a) on the
date such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with
respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section
11.17(a) shall relieve any Loan Party of its obligation to pay any amounts
pursuant to Section 4.1 in the event that, as a result of any change in any
applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change
in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no
longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the
account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan
Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a
reduced rate.

                  (iv)     The Administrative Agent may, without reduction,
withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under
any of the Loan Documents with respect to which any Loan Party is not required
to pay additional amounts under this Section 11.17(a).

                  (b)      Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each
Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly
signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender

                                      144

<PAGE>

fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up
withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.

                  (c)      If any Governmental Authority asserts that the
Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case
may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any
Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including
all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the
Administrative Agent.

                  Section 11.18. Replacement of Lenders. Under any circumstances
set forth herein providing that the Company shall have the right to replace a
Lender as a party to this Agreement, the Company may, upon notice to such Lender
and the Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to
assign its Commitments (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Company in
such instance) pursuant to Section 11.7(b) to one or more other Lenders or
Eligible Assignees procured by the Company; provided, however, that if the
Company elects to exercise such right with respect to any Lender pursuant to
Section 4.6(b), it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made
similar requests for compensation pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.4. The Company
shall (a) pay in full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to
such Lender through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 4.5), (b) provide appropriate assurances and indemnities
(which may include letters of credit) to the Issuing Lender and the Swingline
Lender as each may reasonably require with respect to any continuing obligation
to fund participation interests in any L/C Obligations or any Swingline Loans
then outstanding, and (c) release such Lender from its obligations under the
Loan Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender's Commitments and
outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans.

                  Section 11.19. Third Parties. Other than with respect to
Existing Del Monte prior to the Time of Merger, this Agreement is made and
entered into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the
Secured Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Agent-Related Persons, and
their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or
indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or
claim in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                  Section 11.20. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. (a) THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE
COLLATERAL AGENT AND THE LENDERS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL
LAW.

                  (b)      ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

                                      145

EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND THE
LENDERS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND THE LENDERS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE
GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. THE COMPANY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND THE LENDERS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS,
COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY
NEW YORK LAW.

                  Section 11.21. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE COMPANY, THE LENDERS,
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE
RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER
LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR
ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO
CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY, THE LENDERS, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR
OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR
ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION
HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENT, RENEWAL,
SUPPLEMENT OR MODIFICATION TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.
