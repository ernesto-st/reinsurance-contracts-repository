                  immediately preceding Floor Plan Adjustment Date and such
                  Request for Borrowing is less than the available Swing Line
                  Commitment then such Borrowing shall constitute a Swing Line
                  Loan and shall be disbursed in accordance with the provisions
                  of Article IV hereof; and

                           (iii) if on any day the conditions precedent set
                  forth in Section 8.3 have been satisfied and a Draft is
                  presented for payment, the payment of which would cause (A)
                  the aggregate principal amount of all Floor Plan Loans then
                  outstanding, plus (B) the aggregate principal amount of all
                  Swing Line Loans then outstanding, plus (C) the


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

                  aggregate principal amount of all Requests for Borrowings of
                  Floor Plan Loans outstanding as of such day to exceed the
                  aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments as of such day, then, in
                  such event:

                                    (1) the Company may either immediately
                           reduce any pending Request for a Borrowing of a Floor
                           Plan Loan which does not consist of a Draft or make a
                           payment of principal on Floor Plan Loans and/or Swing
                           Line Loans in an amount which would prevent the
                           aggregate amounts described in (A), (B) and (C) above
                           from exceeding the aggregate Floor Plan Loan
                           Commitments; or

                                    (2) the Company may request an increase in
                           the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments pursuant to
                           Section 5.5(a), and such Request for Borrowing shall
                           be funded to the extent of such increase; or

                                    (3) if the Company does not elect to act
                           under clause (1) or (2) above and if there is a
                           Reserve Commitment available under Section 3.4, then
                           the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments shall be
                           increased by the amount of such Reserve Commitment,
                           and such Draft shall be funded to the extent of such
                           increase; or

                                    (4) if there is no Reserve Commitment
                           available, such Draft shall be deemed for all
                           purposes a Swing Line Overdraft Loan Borrowing
                           Request (each a "SWING LINE OVERDRAFT BORROWING
                           REQUEST") and such Borrowing shall constitute a Swing
                           Line Overdraft Loan (each, a "SWING LINE OVERDRAFT
                           LOAN") to be disbursed and subject to the provisions
                           of Section 4.6.

                  (e) Each Request for Borrowing may be in writing (including
via facsimile) or telephonic (if promptly confirmed in writing). Each Request
for Borrowing, once given, shall be irrevocable. Each of the Floor Plan
Borrowers hereby authorizes the Floor Plan Agent to disburse Floor Plan Loans
under this Section 2.3 pursuant to the telephone instructions of any Person
purporting to be a Person identified by name on a written list of Persons
authorized by each such Floor Plan Borrower to make a Request for Borrowing for
Floor Plan Loans on behalf of such Borrower(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the Floor Plan Borrowers acknowledges and agrees that the applicable
Floor Plan Borrower shall bear all risk of loss resulting from disbursements
made upon any telephone request.

                  (f) If at any time between Adjustment Dates, the payment of
all of a Swing Line Loan would cause the outstanding balance of all Swing Line
Loans to be less than the Swing Line Minimum Amount, the Company may elect to
cause such funds to be invested in overnight funds or other securities held by
Comerica Securities, Inc. and acceptable to the Floor Plan Agent and the
Lenders, which investments shall be subject to the first priority security
interest of the Floor Plan Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to secure the
outstanding balance of the Obligations. The Floor Plan Agent and any of the
Floor Plan Borrowers may enter into an agreement from time to time to facilitate
the investment of such funds.

                  (g) The Floor Plan Agent may notify each Floor Plan Lender of
any Request for Borrowing in connection with Borrowings with respect to which
the Floor Plan Lenders will make advances pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

         Section 2.4 Notice of Types of Floor Plan Loans and Interest Periods.

                  (c) Each Floor Plan Lender shall, upon request from the Agent,
from time to time as herein provided, advance the amount required in connection
with each such Floor Plan Loan Borrowing by paying to the Agent in U.S. Dollars

respective Floor Plan Lenders. Upon receipt of such funds the Floor Plan Agent
shall promptly and in any event on the same day, credit the amount so received

                  (d) On each Floor Plan Adjustment Date if (i) Swing Line Loans

Line Minimum Amount, the Swing Line Overdraft Loans shall be repaid and the
Swing Line Loans shall be reduced to the Swing Line Minimum Amount with proceeds
advanced by the Floor Plan Lenders pursuant to notices from the Floor Plan Agent
given to the Agent as provided in Section 2.4(b) and the Agent shall remit the
proceeds of such Floor Plan Loans to the Floor Plan Agent for application to the
Swing Line Loans (and to the Swing Line Overdraft Loans, if any) outstanding in
excess of the Swing Line Minimum Amount, or (ii) Swing Line Loans are less than
the Swing Line Minimum Amount, the Swing Line Bank shall make a Swing Line Loan

Swing Line Loans


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

outstanding to equal the Swing Line Minimum Amount and the Floor Plan Agent
shall remit the proceeds of such Swing Line Loan to the Floor Plan Borrowers.

         Section 2.5 Payments; Application of Payments.

                  (a) Each Floor Plan Borrower shall, on the Curtailment Date of
a Motor Vehicle financed hereunder, pay in full the Floor Plan Advance Limit

and Section 2.5(b) shall be applied in the following order: (i) first, to the
outstanding principal balance of Swing Line Overdraft Loans, (ii) second, to the
outstanding principal balance of Swing Line Loans (iii) third, only if no Swing
Line Overdraft Loans or Swing Line Loans are then outstanding, to the

                  (d) Each Floor Plan Borrower shall cause all proceeds from the
sale of Motor Vehicles financed hereunder to be deposited directly into an
account of the applicable Borrower with its local financial institution which
proceeds shall be transferred to the Floor Plan Agent as Excess/Payments in
Process for payment of the Loans as provided in Section 2.5(b).

                  (e) An amount equal to two percent (2%) of the original
principal amount of Floor Plan Loans (or any portion thereof) attributable to
each Rental Motor Vehicle shall be payable on the fifteenth (15th) day of each

         Section 2.6 Title Documents. All original Manufacturer's invoices and
title documents evidencing the Floor Plan Borrowers' ownership of all of their
Motor Vehicles financed hereunder, including, without limitation, the
Manufacturer's Certificate, shall be maintained in safekeeping by the Floor Plan
Borrowers in a manner acceptable to the Floor Plan Agent, unless and until an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. After the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, Floor Plan Agent may request and the
Floor Plan Borrowers shall deliver or cause to be delivered within three (3)
Business Days of such request, all such original Manufacturer's invoices and
title documents being maintained by the Floor Plan Borrowers at the time of such
request and, immediately, all such original Manufacturer's invoices and title
documents that later come into the possession of the Floor Plan Borrowers, to
the Floor Plan Agent, and the Floor Plan Agent shall retain or hold all such
original Manufacturer's invoices and title documents so received. Thereafter,
for so long as such Event of Default shall be continuing, all such original
Manufacturer's Certificates and title documents shall remain in the Floor Plan
Agent's possession until the Floor Plan Loan Borrowing in connection therewith
or such ratable portion thereof in respect of a Motor Vehicle sold by any Floor
Plan Borrower has been paid in full; provided that, upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default and during the


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

continuance thereof, the Floor Plan Agent may transfer, as applicable, title
documents delivered to it pursuant to this Section 2.6 in connection with the
sale of Motor Vehicles in accordance with its rights provided for in this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

         Section 2.7 Power of Attorney. For the purpose of expediting the
financing of Motor Vehicles under the terms of this Agreement and for other
purposes relating to such financing transaction, each of the Floor Plan
Borrowers irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Floor Plan Agent and any of
its officers, and each of them, severally, as its true and lawful
attorneys-in-fact or attorney-in-fact with full authority to act on behalf of,
and in the name of, place, and stead of, each such Floor Plan Borrower,
regardless of whether or not an Event of Default shall have occurred hereunder,
to prepare, execute, and deliver any and all instruments, documents, and
agreements required to be executed and delivered by each such Floor Plan
Borrower necessary to evidence Floor Plan Loan Borrowings (and if outstanding,
Swing Line Overdraft Loans) hereunder and/or after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to evidence, perfect, or realize upon the
security interest granted by this Agreement, and/or any of the Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, the Notes evidencing the Floor Plan Loans,
requests for advances, security agreements, financing statements, other
instruments for the payment of money, receipts, manufacturer's certificates of
origin, certificates of origin, certificates of title, applications for
certificates of title, other basic evidences of ownership, dealer reassignments
of any of the foregoing, affidavits, and acknowledgments. The foregoing power of
attorney shall be coupled with an interest, and shall be irrevocable so long as
this Agreement remains in effect, any Drafting Agreement remains in effect or
any Obligations remain outstanding under this Agreement or any of the Notes
evidencing the Floor Plan Loans. Each of said attorneys-in-fact shall have the
power to act hereunder with or without the other. The Floor Plan Agent may, but
shall not be obligated to, notify the Floor Plan Borrowers of any such
instruments or documents the Floor Plan Agent has executed on any Borrower's
behalf prior to such execution.

         Section 2.8 Issuance of Drafting Agreements. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Floor Plan Agent shall, at any time and from time
to time from and after the Closing Date until thirty (30) Business Days prior to
the Maturity Date, upon the written request of the Company or the applicable
Floor Plan Borrower, countersigned by the Company, accompanied by applications,
letter of credit agreements and/or such other documentation related thereto as
the Floor Plan Agent may require, issue Drafting Agreements for the account of
the applicable Floor Plan Borrower.

         Section 2.9 Conditions to Issuance. The Floor Plan Agent shall not be
obligated to enter into or issue a Drafting Agreement unless, as of the date of
issuance of such Drafting Agreement:

                  (a) the Company or the applicable Floor Plan Borrower
requesting the Drafting Agreement shall have delivered to the Floor Plan Agent
not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the requested date for issuance
(or such shorter time as the Floor Plan Agent in its sole discretion may
permit), a written application and such other documentation (including without
limitation a letter of credit agreement if the Drafting Agreement is to be
issued in the form of a letter of credit) and the terms of such documents and of
the proposed Drafting Agreement shall satisfy the terms hereof and otherwise be
satisfactory to Floor Plan Agent;

                  (b) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 8.3;

                  (c) no order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Floor Plan Agent from
entering into or issuing such Drafting Agreement; no Requirement of Law
applicable to the Floor Plan Agent and no request or directive (whether or not


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
the Floor Plan Agent shall prohibit the Floor Plan Agent, or request that the
Floor Plan Agent refrain, from issuing or entering into Drafting Agreements
generally or such Drafting Agreement in particular or shall impose upon the
Floor Plan Agent with respect to such Drafting Agreement any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which the Floor Plan Agent is not otherwise
compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon
the Floor Plan Agent any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
applicable on the Closing Date and which the Floor Plan Agent in good faith
deems material to it (relating to Drafts and Drafting Agreements); and

                  (d) the Floor Plan Agent does not receive written notice from
any Lender, the Agent or any Floor Plan Borrower, on or prior to the Business
Day prior to the requested date of issuance or entry into such Drafting
Agreement that one or more of the applicable conditions contained in Article
VIII (or in this Section 2.9) has not been satisfied or that a Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing.

Each application for a Drafting Agreement issued by a Floor Plan Borrower
hereunder shall constitute certification by each of the Company and the
applicable Floor Plan Borrower of the matters set forth in Section 2.9(a) and
Section 2.9(b), and Floor Plan Agent shall be entitled to rely on such
certification without any duty of inquiry. Immediately upon the issuance or
entering into by the Floor Plan Agent of each Drafting Agreement (except in
respect of any Drafting Agreement issued or entered into by the Floor Plan Agent
after it has obtained actual knowledge that an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing), each Floor Plan Lender, subject to Section 4.6 (relating to a
Swing Line Overdraft Loan), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
and does hereby, purchase from the Floor Plan Agent a participation in such
Drafting Agreement and each Draft thereunder in an amount equal to the product
of (i) the Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan Commitments of such Floor Plan
Lender and (ii) the amount of each Draft presented by a Manufacturer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Floor Plan Agent shall take such action as
necessary to terminate and suspend all Drafting Agreements effective ten (10)
days prior to the Maturity Date, and none of the Borrowers shall be entitled to
borrow under any Drafting Agreement after the date that is ten (10) days prior
to the Maturity Date. Provided, however, the immediately foregoing sentence is
intended only as a limitation to the Borrowers' ability to borrow under Drafting
Agreements and not as an enlargement of the Floor Plan Agent's obligations
hereunder.

         Section 2.10 Notice of Issuance of or Entering into Manufacturers
Drafting Letters. The Floor Plan Agent shall give notice, substantially in the
form of Exhibit 2.10, to each Floor Plan Lender of the issuance of or entering
into each Drafting Agreement not later than five (5) Business Days after
issuance of or entering into each such Drafting Agreement, attaching a copy of
such Drafting Agreement.

         Section 2.11 Drafts Under Manufacturers Drafting Letters.

                  (a) Each Draft submitted by a Manufacturer pursuant to a
Drafting Agreement shall constitute a Request for Borrowing of a Floor Plan
Loan, a Swing Line Loan, or a Swing Line Overdraft Loan, as the case may be.
Upon its submission to the Floor Plan Agent, the Floor Plan Agent shall pay such
Draft, unless it has been terminated or suspended. If the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 8.3 have been satisfied, then such payment shall constitute
a Floor Plan Loan in satisfaction of the Floor Plan Borrower's reimbursement
obligations in respect of such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject
to the terms and conditions of Article XII hereof, the Floor Plan Agent may take
all actions


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

reasonably necessary to suspend and/or terminate Drafts in accordance with
Section 11.2 and following the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the obligation (if any) of the Floor Plan
Agent to fund a Draft, (i) if at any time any of the Floor Plan Borrowers has
failed to satisfy the conditions precedent for the Floor Plan Agent to make a
Floor Plan Loan or the Swing Line Bank to make a Swing Line Loan or a Swing Line
Overdraft Loan, (ii) subject to Section 2.3(d)(iii) if at any time the amount of
such Draft would cause the aggregate amount of Floor Plan Loans to exceed the
aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments, or (iii) after a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, then in any such event, the funding of
such Draft shall not constitute a waiver of any such condition, Default or Event
of Default or otherwise any manner whatsoever affect the rights, and remedies
available to the Floor Plan Agent, the Agent, the Swing Line Bank or any of the
Floor Plan Lenders or the Lenders hereunder. In any such event, the Floor Plan
Borrowers shall remain obligated to pay the amount of any Draft forthwith as set
forth herein and shall have all other duties and obligations applicable to the
Floor Plan Borrowers under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each of the Floor Plan Borrowers shall bear all risk
of loss resulting from the payment of any Draft, or any resulting disbursements
of the Floor Plan Loans, Swing Line Loans or Swing Line Overdraft Loans, as the
case may be, whether or not due to the gross negligence, willful misconduct or
fraud of any Manufacturer.

                  (c) Subject to Section 11.2 hereof, each Floor Plan Lender
shall be obligated to fund Floor Plan Loans resulting from the presentation of
Drafts, by making available their respective Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan
Commitments of the amounts so advanced, all in accordance with Section 2.2
hereof; provided, however, that if for any reason the Floor Plan Agent is
prohibited from making a Floor Plan Loan in respect of any such Draft, each such
Floor Plan Lender shall be deemed to and unconditionally agrees to purchase from
the Floor Plan Agent a participation interest in the amount of such Draft (in
the amount of its Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan Commitments).
Notwithstanding the amount of the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments in
effect from time to time, except with respect to the notices terminating or
suspending drafting privileges to be given pursuant Section 11.1 or Section 11.2
hereof or any other notices given by the Floor Plan Agent in response to the
written direction of the Required Lenders, the Floor Plan Agent shall not be
obligated to terminate or suspend the drafting privileges of any Manufacturer
under the Drafting Agreements even though the aggregate amount of Drafts which
may be presented by Manufacturers under the Drafting Agreements may exceed the
amount of the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments in effect from time to time.
Furthermore, (i) any limitations contained in any of the Drafting Agreements
(whether in respect of daily Drafts to be presented or otherwise) are for
informational purposes only and Floor Plan Agent shall not be obligated to
monitor or limit the amount of Drafts presented or honored on the basis of any
such limitations and (ii) any right of the Floor Plan Agent, acting in its
discretion and not at the direction or with the concurrence of the Required
Lenders, to terminate or suspend drafting privileges of any Manufacturer or
otherwise exercise any right or remedy shall be for the sole benefit and
protection of the Floor Plan Agent, and Floor Plan Agent shall not owe any duty
to any of the other Lenders with respect to such rights or remedies or be
required to exercise such rights or remedies to protect any of the other
Lenders.

         Section 2.12 Obligations Absolute. The Obligations of the Floor Plan
Borrowers under this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents to reimburse
the Floor Plan Agent for Drafts presented by a Manufacturer under a Drafting
Agreement and to repay any Swing Line Loans, the Floor Plan Loans or the Swing
Line Overdraft Loans, as the case may be, funded to pay a Draft shall be
unconditional and irrevocable. Such obligation shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each such other Loan Document
under all circumstances, including the following: (a) any lack of


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;
(b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term
of, all or any of the Obligations of any Borrower in respect of any Draft or any
Drafting Agreement or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to
departure from all or any of the applicable/related Loan Documents; (c) the
existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that any Floor Plan
Borrower may have at any time against any Manufacturer or any other beneficiary
or transferee of any Drafting Agreement (or any Person for whom any such
beneficiary or such transferee may be acting), the Floor Plan Agent or any other
Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the related Loan Documents or any unrelated transaction other than
the defense of payment or claims arising out of the gross negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct of the Floor Plan Agent or the Swing Line Bank; (d) any
Draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under a Drafting
Agreement proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (e)
any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
order to make a Draft under any Drafting Agreement; (f) any payment by the Floor
Plan Agent under any Drafting Agreement against presentation of a draft or
certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of any Drafting
Agreement; (g) any payment made by the Floor Plan Agent under any Drafting
Agreement to any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of a
successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of any Drafting Agreement,
including any arising in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding; (h) any
exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral, or any release or
amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from all or any of the
Obligations of any Borrower in respect of any Drafting Agreement; or (i) any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
discharge of, any Borrower other than the defense of payment or claims arising
out of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Floor Plan
Agent or the Swing Line Bank.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                                ACQUISITION LOANS

         Section 3.1 Acquisition Loan Commitments. Subject to the terms and
conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties of the Company
herein set forth, each Acquisition Loan Lender severally and not jointly agrees
to make revolving credit loans to the Company (each such loan, an "ACQUISITION
LOAN") from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing
Date to the Maturity Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding such Lender's pro rata share of the lesser of (a) the Acquisition
Loan Advance Limit or (b) the aggregate amount of the Acquisition Loan
Commitments of all the Acquisition Loan Lenders; provided, however, that, after
giving effect to any Acquisition Loan Borrowing, the aggregate amount of all
outstanding Acquisition Loans and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations
shall not at any time exceed the aggregate Acquisition Loan Commitments. Subject
to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company may borrow, prepay and
reborrow Acquisition Loans under this Section 3.1.

         Section 3.2 Acquisition Loans.

                  (a) Each Acquisition Loan Borrowing shall be in the minimum
aggregate principal amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (or the amount of
a Letter of Credit Borrowing or the remaining balance of the aggregate
Acquisition Loan Commitments, if less) and an integral multiple of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) and shall consist of Acquisition Loans of the same Type
made by the Acquisition Loan Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Share of Acquisition Loan Commitments; provided, however, that the failure
of any Lender to make any Acquisition Loan shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligation to lend hereunder.

                  (b) Each Acquisition Loan Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing
or a Eurodollar Borrowing as the Company may request in a Request for Borrowing
delivered to the Agent in accordance with Section 3.3. Each Acquisition Loan
Lender may fulfill its Acquisition Loan Commitment with respect to any
Eurodollar Loan by causing, at its option, any domestic or foreign branch or
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan, provided that the exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of the Company to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms hereof. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(b)
and Section 5.9, Acquisition Loan Borrowings of more than one Type may be
outstanding at the same time.

                  (c) Each Acquisition Loan Lender shall make Acquisition Loans
equal to its then Pro Rata Share of the Acquisition Loan Commitments by paying
the amount required to the Agent in Houston, Texas in U.S. Dollars and in
immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on
the proposed Borrowing Date and, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article VIII, the Agent shall promptly and in any event on the same
day, credit the amounts so received to the general deposit account of the
Company, with the Agent, or such other depository account as shall be designated
by the Company or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any
condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts
so received to the respective Lenders.

         Section 3.3 Notice of Acquisition Loan Borrowings.

                  (a) In order to obtain an Acquisition Loan, the Company shall
make an irrevocable written request therefor (or irrevocable telephone notice
thereof, confirmed as soon as practicable by written request) to the Agent, in
the form of a Request for Borrowing (i) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not
later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, one (1) Business Day before the
Borrowing Date of a proposed Acquisition Loan Borrowing, and (ii) in the case of
a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, three
(3) Business Days before the Borrowing Date of a proposed Acquisition Loan
Borrowing. Each Request for Loan Borrowing shall be irrevocable and specify (1)
whether the Loan then being requested is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
Borrowing, (2) the Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day) and (3) the
aggregate amount thereof and (4) if a Eurodollar Loan is being requested, the
Interest Period or Interest Periods with respect thereto. If no election as to
the Type of Acquisition Loan Borrowing is specified, such Borrowing shall be an
ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified, the Company shall be deemed
to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month's duration. The Agent shall
promptly advise the Lenders of any Request for Borrowing given by the Company
pursuant to this Section 3.3 and of each Lender's portion of the requested
Acquisition Loan Borrowing.

                  (b) No more than eight (8) Acquisition Loans may be
outstanding at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings comprised of
Acquisition Loans having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

         Section 3.4 Reserve Commitment; Suspension of Acquisition Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article III, in the event that
on any day the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all (a) Floor Plan
Loans, plus (b) Swing Line Loans, plus (c) Requests for Floor Plan Loan
Borrowings exceeds ninety-seven and one-half percent (97.5%) of the aggregate
Floor Plan Loan Commitments as of such date, then (i) a portion of the
Acquisition Loan Commitment (the "RESERVE COMMITMENT") in an amount equal to the
lesser of (y) Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or (z) the entire remaining
unused portion of the Acquisition Loan Commitment as of such date, shall be
reserved and shall no longer be available for funding Acquisition Loans, and
(ii) no further Acquisition Loan


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Borrowings (after giving effect to the Reserve Commitment in clause (i) hereof)
shall be available to the Company until the next Business Day on which such
condition no longer exists.

                                SWING LINE LOANS

         Section 4.1 Swing Line Commitments.

                  (a) The Swing Line Bank shall, on the terms and subject to the
conditions hereinafter set forth (including Section 4.3), make one or more
advances (each such advance being a "SWING LINE LOAN") to any Floor Plan
Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
Closing Date to the Maturity Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
at any time (not including Swing Line Overdraft Loans) the aggregate amount of
the Swing Line Commitment as such amount may change from time to time.

                  (b) The Swing Line Bank may on the terms and subject to the
conditions hereinafter set forth (including Section 4.3) make one or more Swing
Line Loans to any Floor Plan Borrower from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the Closing Date to the Maturity Date in an aggregate
principal amount greater than the Swing Line Commitment but not to exceed at any
time (not including Swing Line Overdraft Loans) the aggregate amount of the
Floor Plan Loan Commitments of all the Lenders; provided, however, that after
giving effect to all Borrowings of Swing Line Loans, Floor Plan Loans and all
Floor Plan Loans requested on any date, the sum of the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Floor Plan Loans and Swing Line Loans (but excluding
Swing Line Overdraft Loans) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the then
applicable aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments.

                  (c) Unless otherwise refinanced pursuant to Section 4.5, all
Swing Line Loans (including the Swing Line Overdraft Loans) shall be evidenced
by the Swing Line Note, under which advances, repayments and readvances may be
made, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all other Swing
Line Loans shall be due and payable on each Floor Plan Adjustment Date. Each
Swing Line Loan that is a Eurodollar Loan shall mature and the principal amount
thereof shall be due and payable by the applicable Floor Plan Borrower, as the
case may be, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. In no
event whatsoever shall any outstanding Swing Line Loan be deemed to reduce,
modify or affect any Lender's obligation to make Floor Plan Loans based upon its
Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan Commitments.

         Section 4.2 Accrual of Interest; Margin Adjustments. Each Swing Line
Loan and each Swing Line Overdraft Loan shall, from time to time after the date
of such Loan, bear interest at the Quoted Rate. The amount and date of each such
Swing Line Loan and each such Swing Line Overdraft Loan, the Quoted Rate, its
Interest Period, and the amount and date of any repayment shall be noted on the
Swing Line Bank's records, which records will be conclusive evidence thereof,
absent manifest error; provided, however, that any failure by the Swing Line
Bank to record any such information shall not affect the obligations of the
applicable Floor Plan Borrower with respect thereto in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and, further provided, that, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and commencing on
the last day of any applicable Interest Period, each Swing Line Loan shall bear
interest at the Comerica Prime-based Rate.

         Section 4.3 Requests for Swing Line Loans.

                  (a) On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions
hereunder set forth, the Swing Line Bank shall make a Swing Line Loan to one or
more of the Floor Plan Borrowers pursuant to a Request for Borrowing in an
amount equal to the Swing Line Minimum Amount.

                  (b) On any day that a Request for Borrowing constitutes a
Request for Borrowing of a Swing Line Loan pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(ii), the
applicable Floor Plan Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered to Swing Line
Bank a Request for Borrowing in connection therewith, subject to the following
and to the remaining provisions of this Section 4.3:

                           (i) the aggregate principal amount of such requested
                  Swing Line Loan Borrowing, plus the aggregate principal amount
                  of all other Swing Line Loans then outstanding shall not
                  exceed the Swing Line Commitment;

                           (ii) such Request for Borrowing shall be irrevocable
                  and shall constitute a certification by the Company of the
                  provisions of Section 8.3; and

                           (iii) such Request for Borrowing may be in writing
                  (including via facsimile) or telephonic (if promptly confirmed
                  in writing). Each of the Floor Plan Borrowers hereby
                  authorizes the Swing Line Bank to disburse Swing Line Loans
                  pursuant to the telephone instructions of any Person
                  purporting to be a Person identified by name on a written list
                  of Persons authorized by each such Floor Plan Borrower to make
                  Requests for Borrowings of Swing Line Loans on behalf of such
                  Floor Plan Borrowers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
                  the Floor Plan Borrowers acknowledges and agrees that such
                  Floor Plan Borrower shall bear all risk of loss resulting from
                  disbursements made upon any telephone request.

         Section 4.4 Disbursement of Swing Line Loans. Subject to receipt of a
Request for Borrowing of a Swing Line Loan and to the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Swing Line Bank shall make available to any Floor Plan
Borrower the amount so requested, in same day funds, not later than 1:00 p.m.,
Houston, Texas time on the Borrowing Date of such Swing Line Loan, by credit to
an account of the applicable Floor Plan Borrower maintained with the Swing Line
Bank or to such other account or third party as such Floor Plan Borrower may
reasonably direct. The Swing Line Bank shall promptly notify the Floor Plan
Agent of any Swing Line Loan by telephone or telecopier.

         Section 4.5 Refunding of or Participation Interest in Swing Line Loans.

                  (a) On any Floor Plan Adjustment Date, the Swing Line Bank
shall, and upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Swing Line Bank in its sole and absolute discretion, may, on behalf
of any Floor Plan Borrower (each of whom hereby irrevocably directs the Swing
Line Bank to act on its behalf), make a written (including via fax) request to
the Floor Plan Agent, requesting the Floor Plan Lenders (including the Swing
Line Bank in its capacity as a Floor Plan Lender) to make Floor Plan Loans in an
amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Loans in
accordance with each Floor Plan Lender's respective Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan
Loan Commitments (including, but only if an Event of Default shall have occurred
and is continuing, the portion thereof which constitutes the Swing Line Minimum
Amount but excluding Swing Line Overdraft Loans), such loans, which shall accrue
interest at the Comerica Prime-based Rate, to be made immediately in respect of
Swing Line Loans as of the day following the last day of the Applicable


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

Interest Period in respect of Swing Line Loans accruing interest at the Quoted
Rate; provided that no such request shall require any Floor Plan Lender to make
Floor Plan Loans in excess of such Floor Plan Lender's Floor Plan Loan
Commitment (the "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOANS") on the date such request is made;
provided however, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Refunded Swing Line Loans shall not be subject to the indemnification provisions
of Section 5.10, and no losses, costs or expenses may be assessed by the Swing
Line Bank against the applicable Floor Plan Borrower or the other Floor Plan
Lenders as a consequence thereof. Unless an Event of Default described in
Section 11.1(f) or Section 11.1(g) shall have occurred (in which event the
procedures of Section 4.5(b) shall apply) and regardless of whether the
conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement to the making of a Floor Plan
Loan are then satisfied, each Floor Plan Lender shall upon request by the Agent
in the manner specified in Section 2.4 make the proceeds of its Floor Plan Loan
available to the Floor Plan Agent for the benefit of the Swing Line Bank.

                  (b) If, prior to making of a Refunded Swing Line Loan pursuant
to Section 4.5(a), an Event of Default described in Section 11.1(f) or Section
11.1(g) shall have occurred, each Floor Plan Lender shall, in the manner
provided in Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(c), on the date such Floor Plan
Loan was to have been made, purchase from the Swing Line Bank participation
interests in the Refunded Swing Line Loan equal to such Floor Plan Lender's Pro
Rata Share of the Floor Plan Loan Commitments; provided, however, except for any
Borrowing which occurs as a result of a Draft made prior to the effective
suspension or termination of the Drafting Agreement pursuant to which such
Borrowing occurred which Borrowing is subject to Section 2.11, no Floor Plan
Lender shall be obligated to purchase a participation interest in a Refunded
Swing Line Loan to the extent such Loan was made by the Swing Line Bank when the
conditions precedent in Section 8.3 were not satisfied.

                  (c) Subject to Section 4.5(b), above, each Floor Plan Lender's
obligation to make Floor Plan Loans and to purchase participation interests in
accordance with Section 4.5(a) and Section 4.5(b) shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without
limitation, (i) any setoff counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Floor Plan Lender may have against the Swing Line Bank, any Floor
Plan Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence
or continuance of any Default or Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Floor Plan Borrower or any other
Person; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any Floor Plan Borrower or any
other Person; (v) any inability of any Floor Plan Borrower to satisfy the
conditions precedent to a Borrowing set forth in this Agreement on the date upon
which such Floor Plan Loan is required to be made or such participating interest
is to be purchased; or (vi) any other circumstance, happening or event
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. If any Floor Plan
Lender does not make available to the Floor Plan Agent the amount required
pursuant to Section 4.5(a) or Section 4.5(b), as the case may be, the Swing Line
Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Floor Plan
Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date of non-payment
until such amount is paid in full at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (d) Refunded Swing Line Loans which are funded by the Floor
Plan Lenders after two (2) Business Days' notice as provided in Section 4.5(a)
shall thereafter become Floor Plan Loans and, subject to any right of
acceleration herein provided, shall remain outstanding until the next succeeding
Floor Plan Adjustment Date. Such Loans shall accrue interest in favor of the
Floor Plan Lenders in accordance with each Floor Plan Lender's respective Pro
Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan Commitments at the Comerica Prime-based Rate. On
the next succeeding Floor Plan Adjustment Date such Loans shall be treated as
all other Floor Plan Loans outstanding in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.4(b).

         Section 4.6 Swing Line Overdraft Loans.

                  (a) On any day that a Request for Borrowing of a Floor Plan
Loan constitutes a Swing Line Overdraft Borrowing Request pursuant to Section
2.3(d)(iii), the applicable Floor Plan Borrower shall be deemed to have
delivered a Swing Line Overdraft Borrowing Request. Such Swing Line Overdraft
Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a certification by
the Company of the provisions of Section 8.3.

                  (b) Swing Line Overdraft Loans shall be made only by the Swing
Line Bank, solely for its own account and shall not be subject to the provisions
of Section 4.5; provided, however, at any time a Swing Line Overdraft Loan is
outstanding, all funds received from any source (other than deposits already in
the Cash Collateral Account) in respect of this Agreement shall be applied first
to the payment in full of the Swing Line Overdraft Loans; and the Floor Plan
Agent, the Agent and the Lenders, as the case may be, shall remit to the Swing
Line Bank, and the Swing Line Bank shall have the right to receive, all payments
(including any prepayments) of principal and interest made by any Borrower in
respect of any Loan and all other proceeds of Collateral securing the Loans for
application and reduction of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swing
Line Overdraft Loans.

                                   ARTICLE V.

                  (a) All Loans made hereunder shall be evidenced by the Notes
or the Swing Line Note, as the case may be and payable as therein provided,
which notes shall be dated the Closing Date, and shall be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the Total Commitments on such date. The outstanding
principal balance of such Loans and all interest thereon and all the
obligations, as evidenced by the Notes, shall be due and payable in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and on the Maturity Date. Each
Note shall bear interest from its date on the outstanding principal balance
thereof as provided in Section 5.2.

                  (b) Each Lender, the Agent, or the Floor Plan Agent and the
Swing Line Bank, on its behalf, is hereby authorized by each Borrower to,
endorse on a schedule attached to the Notes delivered to it (or a computer
generated supplement thereto, which supplement shall be deemed to be a part
thereof), or otherwise record in such Lender's internal records, an appropriate
notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan, as well as the date and
amount of each payment and prepayment with respect thereto; provided, however,
that the failure of any Lender, the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent or the Swing
Line Bank to make such a notation or any error in such a notation shall not
affect the obligations of all Borrowers hereunder or under the Notes or the
Swing Line Note.

         Section 5.2 Interest on Loans.

                  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, each Alternate
Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to the lesser of
(i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Alternate Base Rate
Loans and (ii) the Highest Lawful Rate (if the Alternate Base Rate is based on
the Prime Rate, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over
a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; or if the Alternate Base Rate is
based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate, computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days).

<PAGE>

                  (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, each Comerica
Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum (computed on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the
lesser of (i) the Comerica Prime-based Rate in effect from time to time and (ii)
the Highest Lawful Rate.

                  (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, (i) each

360 days) equal to the lesser of (1) the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Acquisition Loans
and (2) the Highest Lawful Rate; and (ii) each Eurodollar Loan which is a Floor
Plan Loan (excluding Swing Line Loans carried at the Quoted Rate) shall bear
interest at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the lesser of (1) the LIBO Rate for
the Interest Period in effect for such Loan plus: (A) 1.125% if such Loan is to
finance the purchase of all new Motor Vehicles and (B) 1.25% if such Loan is to
finance the purchase of all Motor Vehicles (other than new Motor Vehicles), and
(2) the Highest Lawful Rate.

                  (d) Interest on each Swing Line Loan to which the Quoted Rate
applies at Borrower's option and Swing Line Overdraft Loan and Drafts shall bear
interest at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the lesser of (i) the Quoted Rate for
the Interest Period in effect for such Loan and (ii) the Highest Lawful Rate.

                  (e) Interest on each Acquisition Loan and each Floor Plan Loan
shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable to such
Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Interest on each Swing Line
Loan and Swing Line Overdraft Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. The applicable LIBO Rate, and the Alternate Base Rate shall be
determined by the Agent, and the Comerica Prime Rate and the Comerica
Prime-based Rate shall be determined by the Floor Plan Agent, and such
determinations shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The Agent or Floor
Plan Agent, as applicable shall promptly advise the Borrowers and each Lender of
each such determination.

         Section 5.3 Interest on Overdue Amounts. If any Borrower shall default
in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount
due hereunder, by acceleration or otherwise, such Borrower shall on demand from
time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted
amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as
before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed over a period of 360 days) equal to the lesser of (a) the
Highest Lawful Rate and (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per
annum.

         Section 5.4 Fees.

                  (a) The Company shall pay to the Agent, on the last day of
each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date, in
immediately available funds, (i) for the prorata benefit of the Floor Plan
Lenders, a Floor Plan Loan Commitment fee (the "FLOOR PLAN LOAN COMMITMENT FEE")
equal to twenty-five-one-hundredths of one percent (0.25%) per annum times the
average unused amount of the Floor Plan Loan Commitments, during the immediately
preceding fiscal quarter (or shorter portion thereof) just ended; (ii) for the
prorata benefit of the Acquisition Loan Lenders, an Acquisition Loan Commitment
fee (the "ACQUISITION LOAN COMMITMENT FEE") equal to the average unused amount
of the Acquisition Loan Commitments (without regard to whether the Acquisition
Loan Commitments have been reallocated or converted to the Floor Plan Loan
Commitment


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

in accordance with the terms hereof) during the immediately preceding fiscal
quarter (or shorter period thereof) just ended, times the then applicable
Commitment Fee Rate set forth in the table contained in the definition of
Applicable Margin. All Commitment Fees under this Section 5.4(a) shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be. The Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed
"unused" to the extent and in the amount such Lender is obligated to fund future
Loans or Letter of Credit Obligations of any Borrower regardless of whether or
not any fundings exist under the Swing Line Loan. The Floor Plan Loan Commitment
Fees and the Acquisition Loan Commitment Fees due to each Lender shall commence
to accrue on the Closing Date and cease to accrue on the earlier of the Maturity
Date or the termination of the Commitments of such Lender pursuant to Section
5.5 or Section 13.3(b).

                  (b) The Company shall pay the Agent and J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. the fees (the "AGENCY FEES") in such amount and on such dates as may be
agreed between the Company, the Agent and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. for their
account and for the account of the Lenders, as applicable, as set forth in that
certain letter agreement dated February 21, 2003 among said parties (the
"AGENT'S LETTER").

                  (c) The Company shall pay the Floor Plan Agent a Floor Plan
Agency Fee ("FLOOR PLAN AGENCY FEE") in such amount on such dates as may be
agreed between the Company and the Floor Plan Agent pursuant to that certain
letter agreement between said parties dated as of the Closing Date (the "FLOOR
PLAN AGENT'S LETTER").

                  (d) The Company shall pay the Agent for the benefit of the
Floor Plan Lenders, according to their Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan
Commitments, a fee in the amount of $750.00 for each day any Swing Line
Overdraft Loan is outstanding; and such amount (if any) shall be payable on the
last Business Day of each month.

                  (e) The Company shall pay to the Agent on the Closing Date,
for the fees payable to the Lenders as provided in the Agent's Letter.

         Section 5.5 Termination, Reduction or Conversion of Commitments.

                  (a) Subject to Section 3.4, upon at least three (3) Business
Days' prior written notice to the Agent, the Company may at any time, in whole,
permanently terminate or permanently reduce the Total Commitments, ratably among
the Lenders in accordance with (i) their respective Pro Rata Share of Floor Plan
Loan Commitments, and (ii) their respective Pro Rata Share of Acquisition Loan
Commitments; provided, however, that (x) any such partial reduction of the Total
Commitments shall be in minimum aggregate increments of Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000); (y) any such partial reduction shall be made ratably between the
aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments and the aggregate Acquisition Loan
Commitments respectively, and pro rata among the Lenders within each type of
Commitment, and (z) no reduction shall reduce the amount of the Acquisition Loan
Commitments to an amount which is less than the Letter of Credit Obligations
outstanding at such time. In connection with any such reduction, the Floor Plan
Agent in its sole discretion may, or at the direction of the Required Lenders,
shall suspend and/or terminate all or any portion of the then outstanding
Drafting Agreements. In addition, (i) no such reduction shall cause the
Acquisition Loan Commitments to exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the Total
Commitments and (ii) the ratio of such Lender's Floor Plan Loan Commitment to
such Lender's Acquisition Loan Commitment shall never be less than 3.0 to 1.0.

                  (b) Subject to Section 5.5(a), above, at any time there exists
any unused portion of the Acquisition Loan Commitments, the Company may request
the Agent to convert all or a part of such


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

unused portion of the Acquisition Loan Commitments into Floor Plan Loan
Commitments, provided, that following such conversion, the total of the
Acquisition Loan Commitments shall never be less than an amount equal to (i) the
sum of all Acquisition Loans then outstanding, plus (ii) all Letter of Credit
Obligations then outstanding, plus (iii) the remaining unused portion of the
Acquisition Loan Commitments after subtracting the amount thereof converted to
the Floor Plan Loan Commitments; and in such event and following five (5) days
prior written notice from the Company to the Agent, the Floor Plan Loan
Commitments shall, upon such request, be increased by the amount so requested by
the Company, such amount together with the Acquisition Loan Commitments not to
exceed the Total Commitment. At any time there exists any unused amount of a
converted portion of the Floor Plan Loan Commitments, the Company may request
the Agent to reverse any such portion thereof, in whole or in part, and in such
event the Floor Plan Loan Commitments and the Acquisition Loan Commitments shall
be restored, as applicable, in the respective amounts so requested by the
Company.

                  Upon any such conversion of Acquisition Loan Commitments into
Floor Plan Loan Commitments or vice versa, the Floor Plan Loan Commitments shall
be increased or decreased, as the case may be, prorata among the Floor Plan
Lenders, and the Acquisition Loan Commitments shall be increased or decreased,
as the case may be, in an aggregate amount of the corresponding increase or
decrease in the Floor Plan Loan Commitments, which increase or decrease in the
Acquisition Loan Commitments shall be allocated among the Acquisition Loan
Lenders on a prorata basis based on their respective Acquisition Loan
Commitments.

                  (c) At the time the Commitments of any Lender are terminated
or reduced pursuant to Section 5.5, the Company shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each such Lender, the Floor Plan Loan Commitment Fees and the
Acquisition Loan Commitment Fees on the amount of the Commitments so terminated
or reduced owed through the date of such termination or reduction.

                  (d) Each of the Commitments shall automatically and
permanently terminate on the Maturity Date.

         Section 5.6 Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two (2) Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Agent shall have determined
that: (a) dollar deposits in the amount set forth in such Request for Borrowing
are not generally available in the London interbank market or that the rate at
which dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect
the cost to any Lender or the Swing Line Bank of making or maintaining the
principal amount of its Eurodollar Loan comprising such Borrowing during such
Interest Period, or (b) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO
Rate, then the Agent shall as soon as practicable thereafter give written notice
of such determination to the Company, the Lenders and/or the Swing Line Bank;
and any request by a Borrower for the making of a Eurodollar Borrowing shall,
until the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to
be a request for a Borrowing to be comprised of (i) if such Borrowing is a Floor
Plan Loan Borrowing, Comerica Prime Rate Loans, and (ii) if such Borrowing is an
Acquisition Loan Borrowing, Alternate Base Rate Loans. Each determination of the
Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.

         Section 5.7 Prepayment of Loans; Mandatory Reduction of Indebtedness.

                  (a) So long as no Swing Line Overdraft Loans are outstanding,
each Acquisition Loan Borrowing, each Floor Plan Loan Borrowing and each Swing
Line Loan may be prepaid at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part,
subject to the requirements of Section 5.10, but otherwise


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

without premium or penalty, upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written
or facsimile notice to the Agent. Each Swing Line Overdraft Loan Borrowing may
be prepaid at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, subject to
the requirements of Section 5.10, but otherwise without premium or penalty.

                  (b) On the date of any termination or reduction of the Total
Commitments pursuant to Section 5.5(a) or Section 5.5(d), each of the Borrowers
shall prepay so much of its Loans (up to the amount by which the Commitments are
so terminated or reduced) as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate
principal amount of the Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding will
not exceed the Total Commitments following such termination or reduction. All
prepayments under this paragraph shall be subject to Section 5.10.

                  (c) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment
date and the principal amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid,
which notice shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower making such
notice to prepay such Loan by the amount stated therein on the date stated
therein. All prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the
principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment.

                  (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(iii), if at
any time and for any reason:

                           (i) the aggregate principal amount of all (y) Floor
                  Plan Loans outstanding, plus (z) Swing Line Loans outstanding
                  shall exceed the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments at such
                  time, or

                           (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all (y)
                  Acquisition Loans, plus (z) Letter of Credit Obligations shall
                  exceed the amount of the aggregate Acquisition Loan
                  Commitments, or

                           (iii) the aggregate principal amount of all (w) Floor
                  Plan Loans outstanding, plus (x) Swing Line Loans outstanding,
                  plus (y) Acquisition Loans outstanding, plus (z) Letter of
                  Credit Obligations outstanding shall exceed the Total
                  Commitments,

the Borrowers shall immediately pay to the Agent (for application in the manner
directed by the Company) an amount of such Obligations equal to such excess,
provided, however, that Borrowers shall have the right to direct such repayment
first to prepay such portion of the Indebtedness not subject to the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement in Section 5.10.

         Section 5.8 Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.

                  (a) It is understood that the cost to each Lender of making or
maintaining any of the Eurodollar Loans may fluctuate as a result of the
applicability of reserve requirements imposed by the Board at the ratios
provided for in Regulation D on the date hereof. The Borrowers agree to pay to
each of the Lenders from time to time such amounts as shall be necessary to
compensate such Lender for the portion of the cost of making or maintaining
Eurodollar Loans resulting from any increase in such reserve requirements
provided for in Regulation D from those as in effect on the date hereof, it
being understood that the rates of interest applicable to Eurodollar Loans have
been determined on the assumption that no such reserve requirements exist or
will exist and that such rates do not reflect costs imposed on the Lenders in
connection with such reserve requirements.

                  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the
date of this Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the
force of law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of
the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any
other fees or amounts payable hereunder (other than taxes imposed on the overall
net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its
principal office or is located or by any political subdivision or taxing
authority therein), or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, such Lender or shall impose on such
Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining
any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect
thereof, by an amount deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be
material, then the Borrowers shall pay as required in Section 5.8(d) such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional
costs or reduction will be paid to such Lender with respect to the Eurodollar
Loans.

                  (c) If any Lender shall have determined that the applicability
of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted pursuant to or arising out of
the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and
Supervisory Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement
and Capital Standards," or any successor report thereto, or the adoption after
the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation
or administration of any of the foregoing by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office of such
Lender) or any Lender's holding company with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by
such Lender pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of
such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Lender to be material, then the Borrowers shall pay as required
to Section 5.8(d) to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

                  (d) A certificate of each Lender setting forth in reasonable
detail calculations (together with the basis and assumptions therefor) to
establish such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate without
duplication such Lender (or participating banks or other entities pursuant to
Article XIII subject to the limitations set forth therein) under Section 5.8(a),
Section 5.8(b) or Section 5.8(c) shall be delivered to the Agent which shall
promptly deliver the same to the Company and such certificate shall be
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amount or amounts which such Lender is
entitled to receive. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due
on any such certificate within ten (10) days after its receipt of the same.

                  (e) Any demand for compensation pursuant to this Section 5.8
must be made on or before one (1) year after the Lender incurs the expense, cost
or economic loss referred to or such Lender shall be deemed to have waived the
right to such compensation. The protection of this Section 5.8 shall be
available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity
or inapplicability of


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

any law, regulation or other condition which shall give rise to any demand by
such Lender for compensation.

                  (f) Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall entitle any Lender to
receive interest at a rate per annum in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.

                  (g) The term "Lender" or "Lenders" as used in this Section 5.8
shall include the Swing Line Bank and the provisions hereof, when applicable,
shall apply to the Swing Line Bank.

         Section 5.9 Change in Legality.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained,
if any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any
Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof
shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or
to give effect to its obligations in respect of any Eurodollar Borrowing
contemplated hereby, then, by written notice to the Agent, such Lender may:

                           (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter
                  be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by any
                  Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing shall, as to such Lender
                  only, be deemed a request for an Alternate Base or the
                  Comerica Prime Rate Loan, as applicable unless such
                  declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

                           (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans
                  made by it be converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans, in which
                  event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically
                  converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans if Acquisition Loans
                  and to Comerica Prime Rate Loans if Floor Plan Loans, as of
                  the effective date of such notice as provided in Section
                  5.9(b).

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
Alternate Base Rate Loans if Acquisition Loans and to Comerica Prime Rate Loans
if Floor Plan Loans, made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the
conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

                  (b) For purposes of Section 5.9(a), a notice to the Agent by
any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last
day of the then-current Interest Period or, if there are then two (2) or more
current Interest Periods, on the last day of each such Interest Period,
respectively; otherwise, such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt
by the Agent.

                  (c) The term "Lender" or "Lenders" as used in this Section 5.9
shall include the Swing Line Bank and the provisions hereof, when applicable,
shall apply to the Swing Line Bank.

         Section 5.10 Indemnity.

                  (a) The Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender against any loss
or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) any
failure by any Borrower to fulfill on the date of any Borrowing hereunder the
applicable conditions set forth in Article VIII, (ii) any failure by any
Borrower to borrow, convert or continue hereunder after delivery of a Request
for Borrowing or a notice of conversion or continuation has been given pursuant
to Section 2.4, Section 3.3 and Section 5.15, (iii) any payment, prepayment or
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other provision


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

of this Agreement or otherwise made on a date other than the last day of the
applicable Interest Period, (iv) any default in payment or prepayment of the
principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as
and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, by irrevocable notice of
prepayment or otherwise), or (v) the occurrence of any Event of Default,
including, but not limited to, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or
incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof
as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by each Lender of (A) its
cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid or converted or not
borrowed (based on the LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the
date of such payment, prepayment or conversion or failure to borrow to the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date
of such failure to borrow) over (B) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Lender) that could be realized by such Lender in reemploying
during such period the funds so paid, prepaid or converted or not borrowed. A
certificate of each Lender setting forth in reasonable detail calculations
(together with the basis and assumptions therefore) to establish any amount or
amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.10
shall be delivered to the Agent which shall promptly deliver the same to the
Company and such certificate shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the
amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive. Nothing in this
Section 5.10 shall entitle any Lender to receive interest at a rate per annum in
excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.

                  (b) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall remain operative
and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Lender; provided demand for compensation pursuant to Section 5.8
must be made on or before one (1) year after the Lender incurs the expense, cost
or economic loss referred to or such Lender shall be deemed to have waived the
right to such compensation. All amounts due under this Section 5.10 shall be
payable within ten (10) days after receipt of demand therefor.

                  (c) The term "Lender" or "Lenders" as used in this Section
5.10 shall include the Swing Line Bank and the provisions hereof, when
applicable, shall apply to the Swing Line Bank.

         Section 5.11 Pro Rata Treatment. Except as otherwise provided herein,
each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of the Notes, each
payment of interest on such Notes, each other reduction of the principal or
interest outstanding under such Notes, however achieved, each payment of the
Commitment Fees and each reduction of the Commitments shall be made, as
applicable, in accordance with each Lender's respective (i) Pro Rata Share of
Floor Plan Loan Commitments and (ii) Pro Rata Share of Acquisition Loan
Commitments.

         Section 5.12 Payments.

                  (a) The Company and/or any of the Borrowers shall make all
payments of principal and interest on any Swing Line Loan and any Swing Line
Overdraft Loan, any curtailment payment, and payments of the proceeds of the
sale of any Motor Vehicle to the Floor Plan Agent on the date when due in
dollars to the Floor Plan Agent at its offices in Detroit Michigan, and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company and/or any of the Borrowers
shall make all payments (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing,
Agency Fee, or any other fees or other amounts) payable hereunder and under any
other Loan Document not later than 1:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on the date
when due in


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

dollars to the Agent at its offices at 707 Travis Street, Houston, TX 77002, in
immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim.

                  (b) Subject to the provisos contained in subclause (A) of the
definition of "Interest Period", whenever any payment (including principal of or
interest on any Borrowing or any fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is
not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of interest or fees, if applicable.

                  (c) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the date of a Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the
Agent its portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing. The
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the appropriate
Person on such date a corresponding amount. If, and to the extent that a Lender
shall not have made its portion of a Borrowing available to the Agent, such
Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Agent until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent (i) in the case of the Borrowers, at the
Alternative Base Rate or Comerica Prime Rate, as applicable, to the Loans
comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, at the Federal
Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding
amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's portion of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.

         Section 5.13 Sharing of Setoffs. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.6(b) in connection with the payment of Swing Line Overdraft Loans,
each Lender agrees that if it shall, in any manner, including through the
exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against any
Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the
United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of,
such secured claim, received by such Lender under any Insolvency Proceeding or
otherwise, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Note held
by it as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of the Note held by it
shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Note held
by any other Lender, it shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from
such other Lender a participation in the Note held by such other Lender, so that
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Note and participations in Notes
held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all Notes then outstanding as the principal amount of the
Note held by it prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
was to the principal amount of all Notes outstanding prior to such exercise of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim; provided, however, that if any such
purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 5.13
and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase
or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery
and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The
Borrowers expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any
Person holding a participation in a Note under this Section 5.13 may exercise
any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any
and all moneys owing by any such Borrower to such Lender as fully as if such
Lender had made a Loan directly to such Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

         Section 5.14 Payments Free of Taxes.

                  (a) Any and all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding taxes imposed on the Agent's, the Floor


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

Plan Agent's, the Swing Line Bank's or any Lender's or any transferee's or
assignee's, excluding a participation holder's (any such entity a "TRANSFEREE")
net income and franchise taxes imposed on the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent, the
Swing Line Bank or any Lender (or Transferee) by the United States or any
jurisdiction under the laws of which it is organized or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES").
If the Borrowers shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder to the Lenders (or any Transferee), the Agent, the
Floor Plan Agent or the Swing Line Bank then: (i) the sum payable shall be
increased by the amount necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
5.14) such Lender (or Transferee) or the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent or the
Swing Line Bank (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall
make such deductions and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document which are not excluded under Section
5.14(a) (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

                  (c) The Borrowers will indemnify each Lender (or Transferee),
the Swing Line Bank, the Agent and/or the Floor Plan Agent for the full amount
of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 5.14) paid by such Lender (or
Transferee), the Swing Line Bank, the Agent and/or the Floor Plan Agent, as the
case may be, and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority or
other Governmental Authority. Such indemnification shall be made within thirty
(30) days after the date any such Person indemnified hereunder makes written
demand therefor, such demand to contain a certificate setting forth the
calculations (including all assumptions and the basis therefor) to establish the
amount for which indemnity is claimed. If a Lender (or Transferee), the Agent,
the Swing Line Bank, and/or the Floor Plan Agent shall become aware that it is
entitled to receive a refund in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes, it shall
promptly notify the Company of the availability of such refund and shall, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a request by the Borrowers, apply for such
refund at the Company's expense. If any Lender (or Transferee), the Swing Line
Bank, the Agent and/or the Floor Plan Agent receives a refund in respect of any
Taxes or Other Taxes for which such Person has received payment from any of the
Borrowers, it shall promptly notify the Company of such refund and shall, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a request by any of the Borrowers (or promptly
upon receipt, if any of the Borrowers has requested application for such refund
pursuant hereto), repay such refund to the Company, net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of such Person and without interest; provided that the Borrowers, upon
the request of such Person, agree to return such refund (plus penalties,
interest or other charges) to such Person in the event such Person is required
to repay such refund.

                  (d) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of
Taxes or Other Taxes withheld by the Borrowers in respect of any payment to any
Lender (or Transferee) the Swing Line Bank, the Agent, and/or the Floor Plan
Agent, the Borrowers will furnish to such Person, at its address referred to in
Section 13.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof to the extent available.


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

                  (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 5.14
shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans
made hereunder.

                  (f) The Agent, the Floor Plan Agent, each Lender, the Swing
Line Bank and each Transferee each represents that is either (i) a corporation
organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof or
(ii) it is entitled to complete exemption from United States withholding tax
imposed on or with respect to any payments, including fees, to be made to it
pursuant to this Agreement (y) under an applicable provision of a tax convention
to which the United States of America is a party or (z) because it is acting
through a branch, agency or office in the United States of America and any
payment to be received by it hereunder is effectively connected with a trade or
business in the United States of America. Each Lender (or Transferee) which is
organized outside the United States shall, on the date it becomes a signatory
hereto, deliver to the Company such certificates, documents or other evidence,
as required by the Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto,
including Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or Form W-8 ECI and any other
certificate or statement of exemption required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1441-1(a) or Section 1.1441-6(c) or any subsequent version thereof, properly
completed and duly executed by such Lender (or Transferee) establishing such
payments to it are (i) not subject to withholding under the Code because such
payment is effectively connected with the conduct by such Lender (or Transferee)
of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) totally exempt from United
States tax under a provision of an applicable tax treaty. Unless the Company and
the Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating
that payments hereunder or under the Notes are not subject to United States
withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable
tax treaty, the Borrowers, the Agent, the Swing Line Bank and/or the Floor Plan
Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate
in the case of payments to or for any Lender (or Transferee) or assignee
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States.

                  (g) The Borrowers shall not be required to pay any additional
amounts to any Lender (or Transferee) in respect of United States withholding
tax pursuant to Section 5.14(a) or Section 5.14(c) if the obligation to pay such
additional amounts would not have arisen but for the failure of the
representation in Section 5.14(f) to be true or a failure by such Lender (or
Transferee) to comply with the provisions of Section 5.14(f) above unless such
failure results from (i) a change in applicable law, regulation or official
interpretation thereof or (ii) an amendment, modification or revocation of any
applicable tax treaty or a change in official position regarding the application
or interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date (and, in the case
of a Transferee, after the date of assignment or transfer).

                  (h) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any additional amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent
with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document
requested by the Company or to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending
Office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or
reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and
would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

                  (i) If any Lender (or Transferee) requests compensation
pursuant to this Section 5.14, the Company may give notice to such Lender (with
a copy to the Agent) that they wish to seek one or more Eligible Assignees
(which may be one or more of the Lenders) to assume the Commitments of such
Lender and to purchase its outstanding Loans and Note. Each Lender (or
Transferee) requesting compensation pursuant to this Section 5.14 hereto agrees
to sell all of its Commitments, its Loans and its


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

Note pursuant to Section 13.3 to any such Eligible Assignee for an amount equal
to the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and accrued interest on such
Loans and Note plus all Commitment Fees and other fees and amounts due such
Lender (or Transferee) hereunder calculated, in each case, to the date such
Commitment, Loans and Note are purchased, whereupon such Lender (or Transferee)
shall thereafter have no other Commitments or other obligation to the Floor Plan
Borrowers hereunder or under any Note.

         Section 5.15 Applicable Interest Rate.

                  (a) The Company shall have the right with respect to

Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert all or any portion of any
ABR Borrowing into a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue all or any portion of
any Eurodollar Borrowing of any Borrower as a Eurodollar Borrowing for an
additional Interest Period, and (z) not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas
time, three Business Days prior to conversion, to convert all or any portion of
the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another
permissible Interest Period subject in each case to the following:

                           (i) each conversion or continuation shall be made
                  among the Lenders, in accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata
                  Share of Acquisition Loan Commitments;

                           (ii) if less than all the outstanding principal
                  amount of any such Acquisition Loan Borrowing shall be
                  converted or continued, the aggregate principal amount of such
                  Acquisition Loan Borrowing converted or continued shall be an
                  integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and not
                  less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);

                           (iii) if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted at a
                  time other than the end of the Interest Period applicable
                  thereto, the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Lenders
                  under Section 5.10;

                           (iv) any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required
                  to be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into
                  or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing;

                           (v) any portion of a Eurodollar Borrowing which
                  cannot be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar
                  Borrowing by reason of clause (iv) above shall be
                  automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in
                  effect for such Acquisition Loan Borrowing into an ABR
                  Borrowing; and

                           (vi) accrued interest on an Acquisition Loan (or
                  portion thereof) being converted or continued shall be paid by
                  the Company at the time of conversion or continuation.

         Each notice pursuant to this Section 5.15(a) shall be irrevocable and
specify (w) the identity and amount of the Acquisition Loan Borrowing that the
Company requests to be converted or continued, (x) whether such Acquisition Loan
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR
Borrowing, (y) if such notice requests a conversion, the date of such conversion
(which shall be a Business Day) and (z) if such Acquisition Loan Borrowing is to
be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with
respect thereto. If no Interest Period is


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

specified in any such notice with respect to any conversion to or continuation
as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Company shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one (1) month's duration. The Agent shall promptly advise the
other Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 5.15(a) and of each
Lender's portion of any converted or continued Borrowing. If the Company shall
not have given written notice in accordance with this Section 5.15(a) to
continue any Eurodollar Borrowing into a subsequent Interest Period (and shall
not otherwise have given written notice in accordance with this Section 5.15(a)
to convert such Acquisition Loan Borrowing), such Acquisition Loan Borrowing
shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid
pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically be converted into as an ABR
Borrowing.

                  (b) The Company shall have the right with respect to Floor
Plan Loan Borrowings, on behalf of any Floor Plan Borrower, at any time upon
prior irrevocable notice to the Agent (x) not later than 10:00 a.m., Houston,
Texas time, on the date of conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into
a Comerica Prime Rate Borrowing, (y) not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas
time, three Business Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert all or
any portion of any Comerica Prime Rate Borrowing into a Eurodollar Borrowing or
to continue all or any portion of any Eurodollar Borrowing of any Floor Plan
Borrower as a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period, and (z)
not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, three Business Days prior to
conversion, to convert all or any portion of the Interest Period with respect to
any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period subject in each
case to the following:

                           (i) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro
                  rata among the Lenders, in accordance with each Lender's Pro
                  Rata Share of Floor Plan Loan Commitments;

                           (ii) if less than all the outstanding principal
                  amount of any such Floor Plan Loan Borrowing shall be
                  converted or continued, the aggregate principal amount of such
                  Floor Plan Loan Borrowing converted or continued shall be an
                  integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and not
                  less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);

                           (iii) if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted at a
                  time other than the end of the Interest Period applicable
                  thereto, the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Lenders
                  under Section 5.10;

                           (iv) any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required
                  to be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into
                  or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing;

                           (v) any portion of a Eurodollar Borrowing which
                  cannot be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar
                  Borrowing by reason of clause (iv) above shall be
                  automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in
                  effect for such Floor Plan Loan Borrowing into a Comerica
                  Prime Rate Borrowing; and

                           (vi) accrued interest on an Floor Plan Loan (or
                  portion thereof) being converted or continued shall be paid by
                  the Company at the time of conversion or continuation.

         Each notice pursuant to this Section 5.15(b) shall be irrevocable and
specify (w) the identity and amount of the Floor Plan Loan Borrowing that the
Company requests to be converted or continued, (x) whether such Floor Plan Loan
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

Borrowing or a Comerica Prime Rate Borrowing, (y) if such notice requests a
conversion, the date of such conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (z)
if such Floor Plan Loan Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no Interest
Period is specified in any such notice with respect to any conversion to or
continuation as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Company shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one (1) month's duration. The Agent shall
promptly advise the other Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section
5.15(b) and of each Lender's portion of any converted or continued Borrowing. If
the Company shall not have given written notice in accordance with this Section
5.15(b) to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing into a subsequent Interest Period
(and shall not otherwise have given written notice in accordance with this
Section 5.15(b) to convert such Floor Plan Loan Borrowing), such Floor Plan Loan
Borrowing shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless
repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically be converted into a Comerica
Prime Rate Borrowing.

         Section 5.16 Extension of Maturity Date.

                  (a) If no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then
continuing, the Company may, by written notice to Agent (with sufficient copies
for each Lender) (which notice shall be irrevocable and which shall not be
effective unless actually received by Agent) prior to April 1, but not before
March 1, of each fiscal year, request that the Lenders extend the then
applicable Maturity Date to a date that is one year later than the Maturity Date
then in effect. Each Lender shall, not later than April 30th of such fiscal
year, give written notice to the Agent stating whether such Lender is willing to
extend the Maturity Date as requested. If Agent has received the written
approvals of such request from each of the Lenders, then, effective upon the
date of the Agent's receipt of all such written approvals from the Lenders, the
Maturity Date shall be so extended for an additional one year period, the term
"Maturity Date" shall mean such extended date and the Agent shall promptly
notify the Company and the Lenders that such extension has occurred.

                  (b) If (i) any Lender gives the Agent written notice that it
is unwilling to extend the Maturity Date as requested or (ii) any Lender fails
to provide written approval to Agent of such a request on or before April 30 of
such fiscal year, then, (w) subject to Section 5.17(a)(iv) the Lenders shall be
deemed to have declined to extend the Maturity Date, (x) the then-current
Maturity Date shall remain in effect (with no further right on the part of the
Company to request extensions thereof under this Section 5.16).

         Section 5.17 Replacement Lenders.

                  (a) If any Lender (i) makes a demand for compensation pursuant
to Section 5.8(a), Section 5.8(b) or Section 5.8(c), (ii) notifies the Agent of
the unlawfulness of such Lender making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans as
provided in Section 5.9, (iii) requests the Borrowers to make payments for Taxes
or Other Taxes pursuant to Section 5.14, or (iv) gives the Agent notice as
provided in Section 5.16(b) that it is unwilling to extend the Maturity Date or
fails to provide approval of such extension, then in any such event the Company
may, unless such Lender has notified the Company that the circumstances giving
rise to such event no longer apply, terminate, in whole but not in part, the
Commitments of such Lender (other than the Agent) (the "TERMINATED LENDER") at
any time upon five Business Days' prior written notice to the Terminated Lender
and the Agent (such notice referred to herein as a "NOTICE OF TERMINATION").

                  (b) In order to effect the termination of the Commitments of a
Terminated Lender, the Company shall (i) obtain an agreement with one or more
Lenders to increase their Commitments or


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

(ii) request any one or more other Persons to become a "Lender" in place and
instead of such Terminated Lender and agree to accept its Commitments; provided,
however, that such one or more other such Persons are Eligible Assignees
reasonably acceptable to the Agent (such acceptance not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and become parties by executing an Assignment and
Acceptance and (the Lenders or other Persons that agree to accept in whole or in
part the Commitments being referred to herein as the "REPLACEMENT LENDERS"),
such that the aggregate increased and/or accepted Commitments of the Replacement
Lenders under clauses (i) and (ii) above equal the Commitments of the Terminated
Lenders.

                  (c) The Notice of Termination shall include the name of the
Terminated Lender, the date the termination will occur (the "TERMINATION DATE"),
the Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders to which the Terminated Lender
will assign its Commitments, and, if there will be more than one Replacement
Lender, the portion of the Terminated Lender's Commitments to be assigned to
each Replacement Lender.

                  (d) On the Termination Date, (i) the Terminated Lender shall
by execution and delivery of an Assignment and Acceptance assign its Commitments
to the Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders (pro rata, if there is more
than one Replacement Lender, in proportion to the portion of the Terminated
Lender's Commitments to be assigned to each Replacement Lender) indicated in the
Notice of Termination and shall assign to the Replacement Lender or Replacement
Lenders its Loans (if any) so assigned then outstanding (pro rata as aforesaid),
(ii) the Terminated Lender shall endorse its applicable Note(s), payable without
recourse, representation or warranty to the order of the Replacement Lender or
Replacement Lenders (pro rata as aforesaid), (iii) the Replacement Lender or
Replacement Lenders shall purchase the Note(s) held by the Terminated Lender
(pro rata as aforesaid) at a price equal to the unpaid principal amount thereof
plus interest and fees accrued and unpaid to the Termination Date, (iv) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, upon request, execute and deliver,
at its own expense, new Notes to the Replacement Lenders in accordance with
their respective interests, (v) the Company shall, upon request, pay any
compensation due to the Terminated Lender hereunder and (vi) the Replacement
Lender or Replacement Lenders will thereupon (pro rata as aforesaid) succeed to
and be substituted in all respects for the Terminated Lender to the extent of
such assignment from and after such date with the like effect as if becoming a
Lender pursuant to the terms of Section 13.3. To the extent not in conflict, the
terms of Section 13.3 shall supplement the provisions of this Section 5.17.

         Section 5.18 Increase of Commitments. (a) At any time after the date
hereof, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Company may request an increase of the aggregate Commitments by notice to
the Agent in writing of the amount of such proposed increase (such notice, a
"COMMITMENT INCREASE NOTICE") in an amount not less than $25,000,000 nor more
than $200,000,00 in the aggregate. Such increase shall be in the same ratio
between Floor Plan Loan Commitments and Acquisition Loan Commitments as exists
at the time of such increase. Any such Commitment Increase Notice shall be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Agent, and must offer each Lender the
opportunity to subscribe for its pro rata share of each increased Commitment. If
any portion of the increased Commitments is not subscribed for by the Lenders
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of the Commitment Increase
Notice, the Company may, in its sole discretion, but with the consent of the
Agent as to any Person that is not at such time a Lender, offer to any existing
Lender or to one or more additional banks or financial institutions the
opportunity to participate in all or a portion of such unsubscribed portion of
the increased Commitments pursuant to Section 5.18(b) or Section 5.18(c), as
applicable.


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

                  (b) Any additional bank or financial institution that the
Company selects to offer participation in the increased Commitments, and that
elects to become a party to this Agreement with the Company and the Agent (a
"NEW LENDER"), shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as
if originally a party hereof and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits
of this Agreement. The Commitment of any such New Lender shall be in an amount
not less than $10,000,000.

                  (c) Any New Lender that accepts an offer by the Company to
increase its Commitment pursuant to this Section 5.18 shall, in each case,
execute an agreement whereby it agrees to be bound by, and accept the benefits
of, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (a "COMMITMENT INCREASE
AGREEMENT") substantially in the form of Exhibit 5.18(c), with the Company and
the Agent. Upon delivery to the Agent of one or more Commitment Increase
Agreements, the Agent shall enter such New Lender and its Commitment in the
Register and distribute a new Schedule 1.1(a) reflecting the Commitment of such
New Lender and the Total Commitments, as increased.

                  (d) The effectiveness of any Commitment Increase Agreement
shall be contingent upon receipt by the Agent of such corporate resolutions of
the Company and legal opinions of counsel to the Company as the Agent shall
reasonably request with respect thereto, in each case in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

                  (e) If any bank or financial institution becomes a New Lender
pursuant to Section 5.18(b) or any Lender's Commitment is increased pursuant to
Section 5.18(c), additional Loans made on or after the effectiveness thereof
(the "RE-ALLOCATION DATE") shall be made pro rata based on their respective
Floor Plan Loan Commitments in effect on or after such Re-Allocation Date
(except to the extent that any such pro rata borrowings would result, and accept
the benefits of, in any Lender making an aggregate principal amount of Loans in
excess of its Commitment, in which case such excess amount will be allocated to,
and made by, such New Lender and/or Lenders with such increased Commitments to
the extent of, and pro rata based on, their respective Commitments), and
continuations of Eurodollar Loans outstanding on such Re-Allocation Date shall
be effected by repayment of such Eurodollar Loans on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto and the making of new Eurodollar Loans pro
rata based on the respective Commitments in effect on and after such
Re-Allocation Date. In the event that on any such Re-Allocation Date there is an
unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Loans, such Eurodollar Loans shall remain
outstanding with the respective holders thereof until the expiration of their
respective Interest Periods (unless the Company elects to prepay any thereof in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement), and interest on
and repayments of such Eurodollar Loans will be paid thereon to the respective
Lenders holding such Eurodollar Loans pro rata based on the respective principal
amounts thereof outstanding.

                  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
5.18, (i) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment unless
it agrees to do so in its sole discretion and (ii) after giving effect to any
increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section 5.18, the aggregate amount
of the Commitments shall not exceed $1,000,000,000.

                  (g) The Company shall execute and deliver a Note or Notes to
each New Lender in the amount of its Commitments.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

<PAGE>

                  (a) On the terms and conditions set forth herein (i) the
Issuing Bank agrees from time to time on any Business Day during the period from
the Closing Date to the last Business Day thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity
Date (the "LETTER OF CREDIT TERMINATION DATE") to issue Letters of Credit for
the account of any Borrower, and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously
issued by it, in accordance with Section 6.2; and (ii) the Acquisition Loan
Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit Issued for the
account of the Borrowers; provided, that the Issuing Bank shall not be obligated
to Issue, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in, any Letter of
Credit if, as of the date of request of such Letter of Credit, after giving
effect to the maximum amount payable under such Letter of Credit, (y) the
aggregate principal amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding shall
at any time exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment or (z) the aggregate
principal amount of Acquisition Loans outstanding plus the Letter of Credit
Obligations outstanding as of such day shall exceed the Acquisition Loan
Commitments of all the Lenders. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, the ability of the Borrowers to obtain
Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and, accordingly, the Borrowers may,
during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of
Credit which have expired or which have been drawn upon and reimbursed.

                  (b) The Issuing Bank is under no obligation to Issue any
Letter of Credit if: (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from
Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to the
Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank
shall prohibit Issuing Bank, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain, from the
Issuance of Letters of Credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular
or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any
restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not
otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall
impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was
not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith
deems material to it; (ii) the Issuing Bank has received written notice from any
Lender, the Agent or any Borrower, on or prior to the Business Day prior to the
requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one or more of the
applicable conditions contained in Article VIII is not then satisfied; (iii) the
expiration date of any requested Letter of Credit is more than one (1) year from
the date of Issuance thereof or after the Maturity Date; (iv) any requested
Letter of Credit does not provide for drafts, or is not otherwise in form and
substance acceptable to the Issuing Bank, or the Issuance of a Letter of Credit
shall violate any applicable policies of the Issuing Bank, or the Issuance of a
Letter of Credit is for an amount less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) or to be denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars.

         Section 6.2 Issuance, Amendment and Renewal of Letters of Credit.

                  (a) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon the irrevocable
written request of the Company received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by
the Company to the Agent) at least three (3) days (or such shorter time as the
Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to
the proposed date of Issuance. Each such request for Issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall be by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in
the form of a Letter of Credit Application, and shall specify in form and detail
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank such matters as the Issuing Bank may require.
Each Letter of Credit (i) will be for the account of such Borrower, (ii) will be
a (A) nontransferable standby letter of credit to support certain performance
obligations of such Borrower or (B) non-transferable standby letter of credit to
support certain payment obligations of such Borrower that are not prohibited by
this Agreement, (iii) will be for purposes reasonably satisfactory to the

                  (b) Prior to the Issuance of any Letter of Credit, the Issuing
Bank will confirm with the Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Agent has
received a copy of the Letter of Credit Application or Letter of Credit
Amendment Application from any Borrower and, if not, the Issuing Bank will
provide the Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Bank has received
notice prior to its Issuance of a requested Letter of Credit from the Agent (i)
directing the Issuing Bank not to Issue such Letter of Credit because such
Issuance is not then permitted under this Section 6.2, or (ii) that one or more
conditions specified in Article VIII are not then satisfied or waived; then,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank shall, on the
requested date, Issue a Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower in
accordance with the Issuing Bank's usual and customary business practices.

                  (c) From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding
and prior to the Letter of Credit Termination Date, the Issuing Bank will, upon
the written request of any Borrower received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy
sent by the Borrower to the Agent) at least three (3) days (or such shorter time
as the Issuing Bank may agree in particular instance in its sole discretion)
prior to the proposed date of amendment or extension, amend any Letter of Credit
Issued by it or extend the expiry date. Each such request for amendment or
extension of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile, confirmed
immediately in an original writing, made in such form as the Issuing Bank shall
require. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend or extend the
expiry date any Letter of Credit if: (i) the Issuing Bank would have no
obligation at such time to Issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under
the terms of this Agreement; or (ii) the beneficiary of any such Letter of
Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.

                  (d) Upon receipt of notice from the Issuing Bank, the Agent
will promptly notify the Lenders of the Issuance of a Letter of Credit and any
amendment or extension thereto.

                  (e) If any outstanding Letter of Credit shall provide that it
shall be automatically renewed unless the beneficiary thereof receives notice
from the Issuing Bank that such Letter of Credit shall not be renewed, the
Issuing Bank shall be permitted to allow such Letter of Credit to renew, and the
Borrowers and the Lenders hereby authorize such renewal. The Issuing Bank shall
not be obligated to allow such Letter of Credit to renew if the Issuing Bank
would have no obligation at such time to Issue or amend such Letter of Credit
under the terms of this Agreement.

                  (f) The Issuing Bank may, at its election (or as required by
the Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders), deliver any notices of
termination or other communications to any Letter of Credit beneficiary or
transferee, and take any other action as necessary or appropriate, at any time
and from time to time, in order to cause the expiration date of any Letter of
Credit to be a date not later than the Maturity Date.

                  (g) This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict
with any Letter of Credit-Related Document.

                  (h) The Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Agent,
concurrently or promptly following its delivery of a Letter of Credit, or
amendment or extension to a Letter of Credit, to an advising bank or a
beneficiary, a true and complete copy of each such Letter of Credit, amendment,
or extension to a Letter of Credit.

         Section 6.3 Risk Participations, Drawings and Reimbursements.


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

                  (a) Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit,
the Acquisition Loan Lenders hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree to,
and hereby, purchase from the Issuing Bank participation interests in such
Letters of Credit and each drawing thereunder, ratably in amounts equal to the
product of (i) each such Lender's Pro Rata Share of Acquisition Loan
Commitments, and (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter
of Credit and the amount of such drawing respectively. Each Issuance of a Letter
of Credit shall be deemed to utilize the Acquisition Loan Commitment of each
Acquisition Loan Lender by an amount equal to the amount of such participation.

                  (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter
of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Bank will
promptly notify the Company. In the case of Letters of Credit under which
drawings are payable one or more Business Days after the drawing is made, the
Issuing Bank will give such notice to the Company at least one Business Day
prior to the Honor Date. The Company shall reimburse the Issuing Bank prior to
11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on each date that any amount is paid by the
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date, an "HONOR DATE") in an
amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Bank. In the event the Company
fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the full amount of any drawing under any
Letter of Credit by 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on the Honor Date, the
Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Agent and the Agent will promptly notify
each Lender thereof, and the Company shall be deemed to have requested an
Alternate Base Rate Loan that is an Acquisition Loan be made by the Lenders to
be disbursed on the Honor Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the
amount of the unutilized portion of the Acquisition Loan Commitment. Any notice
given by the Issuing Bank or the Agent pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) may be
oral if immediately confirmed in writing (including by facsimile); provided that
the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness
or binding effect of such notice.

                  (c) The Acquisition Loan Lenders shall, subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII, in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Share of Acquisition Loan Commitments upon any notice pursuant to Section
6.3(b) make available to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank an amount
in Dollars and in immediately available funds equal to the amount of the
drawing, whereupon the Lenders shall each be deemed to have made an Acquisition
Loan consisting of an Alternate Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in
that amount. If any Acquisition Loan Lender so notified fails to make available
to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank said amount by no later than
12:00 noon, Houston, Texas time, on the Honor Date, then interest shall accrue
on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the Honor Date to the
date such Lender makes such payment, at the rate per annum equal to the Federal
Funds Rate in effect from time to time during such period. The Agent will
promptly give notice to each Lender of the occurrence of any Honor Date, but
failure of the Agent to give any such notice on the Honor Date or in sufficient
time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve
such Lender from its obligations under this Section 6.3.

                  (d) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not
converted into an Alternate Base Rate Loan in whole or in part, because of
failure of the Company to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article VIII or
for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the
Issuing Bank a Letter of Credit Borrowing in the amount of such drawing, which
Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with
interest) and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum, and each Lender's payment to the
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 6.3(b) shall constitute payment in respect of
its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a
Letter of Credit Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation
obligation under this Section 6.3.

                  (e) Each Acquisition Loan Lender's obligation in accordance
with this Agreement to make Acquisition Loans or Letter of Credit Advances, as
contemplated by this Section 6.3, as a result of a drawing under the Letter of
Credit, shall be absolute and unconditional and without recourse to the Issuing
Bank and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
against the Issuing Bank, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of Default
or a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) any other circumstance, happening or
event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

         Section 6.4 Repayment of Participation.

                  (a) When the Agent receives (and only if the Agent receives),
for the account of the Issuing Bank, immediately available funds from the
Borrowers (i) in respect of which any Acquisition Loan Lender has paid the Agent
for the account of the Issuing Bank for such Lender's participation in the
Letter of Credit Advance pursuant to Section 6.3 or (ii) in payment of interest
thereon, the Agent will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received
by the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, the amount of such funds
attributable to each such Lender and the Issuing Bank shall receive and retain
the amount of such funds attributable to any Lender that did not so pay the
Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank.

                  (b) If the Agent or the Issuing Bank is required at any time
to return to the Borrowers or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or
any official in an Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by
the Borrowers to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 6.4(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit
Advance or interest thereon, each of the Acquisition Loan Lenders shall, on
demand of the Agent, in accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata Share of
Acquisition Loan Commitments, forthwith return to the Agent or the Issuing Bank
the amount so returned by the Agent or the Issuing Bank plus interest thereon
from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such
Lender to the Agent or the Issuing Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.

         Section 6.5 Role of the Issuing Bank.

                  (a) Each Lender and each Borrower agree that, in paying any
drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any
responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates
and other documents, if any, expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.

                  (b) Neither the Issuing Bank nor any of its correspondents,
participants or assignees shall be liable to any Lender for: (i) any action
taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of
the Lenders (including the Required Lenders, as applicable); (ii) any action
taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or
(iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any Letter
of Credit-Related Document.

                  (c) The Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter
of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall
not, preclude any Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have
against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement or
assume risks or losses arising out of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the Issuing Bank. Neither the Issuing


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

Bank, nor any correspondents, participants or assignees of the Issuing Bank,
shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i)
through (vii) of Section 6.6; provided, however, that any Borrower may have a
claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank may be liable to such
Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary damages suffered or incurred by such Borrower(s)
which are caused by the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence
(i) in failing to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by
the beneficiary of a sight draft, certificate(s) and any other documents, if
any, strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit,
(ii) in its paying under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a sight
draft, certificate(s) or other documents not complying with the terms of such
Letter of Credit or (iii) its failure to comply with the obligations imposed
upon it, as an issuing bank, under applicable state law; provided, however, that
(y) the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in
order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary, and (z) the Issuing Bank shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove
to be invalid or ineffective for any reason, provided that any such instrument
appears on its face to be in order.

         Section 6.6 Obligations Absolute. The Obligations of the Borrowers
under this Agreement and any Letter of Credit-Related Document to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and to repay any Letter of
Credit Borrowing and any drawing under a Letter of Credit converted into an
Acquisition Loan, shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each such other
Letter of Credit-Related Document under all circumstances, including the
following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
Letter of Credit-Related Document; (ii) any change in the time, manner or place
of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of any
Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit; (iii) the existence of any claim,
set-off, defense or other right that any Borrower may have at any time against
any beneficiary or any such transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person
for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing
Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Letter of Credit-Related Documents or
any unrelated transaction other than the defense of payment or claims arising
out of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Floor Plan
Agent or the Swing Line Bank; (iv) any draft, demand, certificate or other
document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit;
(v) any payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the
terms of any Letter of Credit or any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any
Letter of Credit to any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee
for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of a
successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit,
including any arising in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding; (vi) any
exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral, or any release or
amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all
or any of the Obligations of any Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit; or
(vii) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available
to, or discharge of, any Borrower.

         Section 6.7 Letter of Credit Fees.

                  (a) Letter of Credit Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent
for the account of each of the Acquisition Loan Lenders a letter of credit fee
(the "LETTER OF CREDIT FEES") with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit
equal to the greater of: (i) $500, or (ii) (A) one and one quarter percent


                                      -56-
<PAGE>

(1.25%) per annum multiplied by the average daily maximum amount available to be
drawn on such outstanding Letters of Credit up to an aggregate face amount of
$5,000,000, and (B) the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans that are
Acquisition Loans for the daily average amount face amount available in excess
of $5,000,000.

                  (b) Fronting Fees. The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank
for its own account a letter of credit fronting fee (the "FRONTING FEES") for
each Letter of Credit Issued by the Issuing Bank equal to one hundred
twenty-five-one-thousandths percent (0.125%) per annum multiplied by the average
daily maximum amount available to be drawn on such outstanding Letters of
Credit.

                  (c) Calculation of Fees. The Letter of Credit Fees and the
Fronting Fees each shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter based upon Letters of Credit outstanding
for that quarter as calculated by the Agent (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days). Such fees shall be due and
payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
during which Letters of Credit are outstanding, commencing on the first such
quarterly date to occur after the Closing Date, through the Maturity Date, with
the final payment to be made on the Maturity Date.

                  (d) Other. The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank from time
to time on demand the normal issuance, presentation, amendment and other
processing fees, and other standard costs and charges of the Issuing Bank
relating to Letters of Credit as from time to time in effect.

         Section 6.8 Cash Collateralization.

                  (a) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, or

insufficient to fund the outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, the Company
agrees that it shall on the Business Day it receives notice from the Agent,
acting upon instructions of the Required Lenders, it will immediately repay in
full all Swing Line Overdraft Loans and deposit in an account (the "CASH
COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") held by the Agent, for the benefits of the Acquisition Loan
Lenders, an amount of cash equal to the Letter of Credit Obligations as of such
date. Such deposit shall be held by the Agent as Collateral for the payment and
performance of the Obligations. The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Cash
Collateral shall be held in a blocked, interest-bearing account held by the
Agent upon such terms and in such type of account as customary at the depository
institution. The Company shall pay any fees charged by the Agent which fees are
of the type customarily charged by such institution with respect to such
accounts. Moneys in such account shall (i) be applied by the Agent to the
payment of Letter of Credit Borrowings and interest thereon, (ii) be held for
the satisfaction of the reimbursement Obligations of the Borrowers in respect of
Letters of Credit, and (iii) in the event the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated, with the consent of the Required Lenders, be applied to satisfy the
Obligations. If the Company shall provide Cash Collateral under this Section
6.8(a) or shall prepay any Letter of Credit and thereafter either (i) drafts or
other demands for payment complying with the terms of such Letters of Credit are
not made prior to the respective expiration dates thereof, or (ii) such Event of
Default shall have been waived or cured, then the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent,
the Swing Line Bank and the Lenders agree that the Agent is hereby authorized,
without further action by any other Person, to release the Lien in such cash and
will direct the Agent to remit to the Company amounts for which the contingent
obligations evidenced by such Letters of Credit have ceased.

                  (b) As security for the payment of all Obligations, each
Borrower hereby grants, conveys, assigns, pledges, sets over and transfers to
the Agent, and creates in the Agent's favor a Lien


                                      -57-
<PAGE>

on, and security interest in, all money, instruments and securities at any time
held in or acquired in connection with the Cash Collateral Account, together
with all proceeds thereof. At any time and from time to time, upon the Agent's
request, each Borrower promptly shall execute and deliver any and all such
further instruments and documents as may be reasonably necessary, appropriate or
desirable in the Agent's judgment to obtain the full benefits (including
perfection and priority) of the security interest created or intended to be
created by this Section 6.8(b) and of the rights and powers herein granted.

or which is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of the Board,
including Regulations T, U or X; provided, however, the Company may acquire
Margin Stock if, upon the acquisition of such Margin Stock, twenty-five percent
(25%) or less of the Company's total assets subject to the restrictions set
forth in Section 10.1 would then be composed of Margin Stock, and the Company
shall furnish to the Agent upon its request, a statement in conformity with the
requirements of Federal Reserve Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U.

         Section 7.11 Taxes. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed
all tax returns which are required to have been filed and has paid, or made
adequate provisions for the payment of, all of its taxes which are due and
payable, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and as to which such reserves or other appropriate
provisions as may be required by GAAP have been maintained. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any proposed assessment against it for
additional taxes (or any basis for any such assessment) which might be material
to the Company or such Subsidiary.

         Section 7.12 Pension and Welfare Plans. Each Plan complies in all
respects with all applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations
except where the failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and: (a) no Reportable Event has occurred and is


                                      -60-

Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawn from any Plan or instituted steps
to do so, except as listed on Schedule 7.12 and (c) since December 31, 2002, no
steps have been instituted to terminate any Plan, except as listed on Schedule
7.12. No condition exists or event or transaction has occurred in connection
with any Plan which could result in the incurrence by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of any liability, fine or penalty which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
is a member of, or contributes to, any multiple employer Plan as described in
Section 4064 of ERISA. None of the Borrowers has any contingent liability with
respect to any post-retirement "welfare benefit plans," as such term is defined
in ERISA which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 7.13 No Material Misstatements. Neither this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents, the Confidential Information Memorandum nor any other
document delivered by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with any Loan Document or included therein contained or contains any
material misstatement of fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

         Section 7.14 Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company
Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company"
or company "controlled" by an investment company as defined in, or subject to

any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         Section 7.15 Maintenance of Insurance. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries agree to maintain insurance to such extent and against such hazards
and liabilities as is commonly maintained by companies similarly situated.

         Section 7.16 Existing Liens. None of the assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary is subject to any Lien, except:

                  (a) Liens for current taxes not delinquent or taxes being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and as to which such
reserves or other appropriate provisions as may be required by GAAP are being
maintained;

                  (b) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', materialmen's,
landlord's and other like statutory or contractual Liens arising in the ordinary
course of business securing obligations which are not overdue for a period of
more than ninety (90) days or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and as to which such reserves or other appropriate
provisions as may be required by GAAP are being maintained;

                  (c) pledges or deposits in connection with workers'
compensation, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation;

                  (d) deposits to secure the performance of bids, trade

such Subsidiary's Indebtedness to the Company or to any other Subsidiary of the
Company;

                  (f) Liens, if any, disclosed in the financial statements
referred to in Section 7.5; and

                  (g) Liens listed on Schedule 7.16(g) and Liens permitted by
Section 10.2.

         Section 7.17 Environmental Matters. Each Borrower has complied in all
respects with all applicable federal, state, local and other statutes,
ordinances, orders, judgments, rulings and regulations relating to environmental
pollution or to environmental regulation or control except where the failure to
comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any
failure so to comply which alone or together with any other such failure could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its facilities manages any hazardous wastes,
hazardous substances, hazardous materials, toxic substances or toxic pollutants,
as those terms are used in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the
Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, in violation of any regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto or in any other applicable law where such violation
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or together with other
violations, a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 7.18 Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, the Company has no
Subsidiaries, and no Subsidiary has a Subsidiary other than those specifically
disclosed in part (a) of Schedule 7.18, and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any equity investments in any other Person other than those
specifically disclosed in part (b) of Schedule 7.18. The state of incorporation
or formation, the address, principal place of business and a list of other
business locations for each Subsidiary is specified in part (a) of Schedule
7.18. The Company and/or each of its Subsidiaries is the owner, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of all Liens (except for Liens in favor of the Agent
and the Lenders and transfer restrictions contained in the Dealer Franchise
Agreements), of all of the issued and outstanding voting stock of each
Subsidiary disclosed on Schedule 7.18 (except where ownership of less than one
hundred percent (100%) is indicated on Schedule 7.18). All shares of such stock
have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and no rights to
subscribe to additional shares have been granted or exist.

         Section 7.19 Engaged in Motor Vehicle Sales. The Floor Plan Borrowers
are engaged in the business of selling Motor Vehicles. All such Motor Vehicles
consist solely of goods held by the Borrowers for sale; no sales or other
transactions involving such Motor Vehicles are and will not become subject to
set-off, counterclaim, defense, allowance, or adjustment (other than warranty
claims, the aggregate amount of which shall not be material). Except as set
forth in Schedule 7.16(g), as of the Closing Date, there is no financing
statement, or similar statement or instrument of registration under the laws of
any jurisdiction, covering or purporting to cover any interest of any kind in
all such Motor Vehicles or their proceeds on file or registered in any public
office other than a financing statement in favor of the Agent for the benefit of
the Lenders covering all such Motor Vehicles. Except as set forth in Schedule
7.16(g), as of the Closing Date, there is no other floor plan or other financing
arrangement with any party other than the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders
with respect to all such Motor Vehicles; and except as set forth in Schedule
7.16(g), as of the Closing Date, none of the Borrowers has made any other verbal
or written contract or arrangement of any kind, the performance of which by the
other party thereto would give rise to a Lien against any such Motor Vehicle, or
the proceeds thereof. All such Motor Vehicles are free from damage caused by
fire or other casualty, unless covered by insurance, subject to customary
deductibles. The locations (and addresses) set forth in Schedule 7.7(a) are the


                                      -62-
<PAGE>

locations at which the Company and its Subsidiaries keep the Motor Vehicles held
as inventory, except when such Motor Vehicles may be in transit between
locations, in transit for 'dealer swaps' or being test driven by potential
customers. The addresses set forth in Schedule 7.7(a) are each Floor Plan
Borrower's place of business and the Company and each Borrower is formed or
incorporated only in the state shown for it on Schedule 7.18 hereto. All of each
Floor Plan Borrower's books and records with regard to all Motor Vehicles are
maintained and kept at the address(es) of such Floor Plan Borrower set forth in
Schedule 7.7(a).

         Section 7.20 Dealer Franchise Agreements. As of the Closing Date, none
of the Borrowers is a party to any dealer franchise agreements or any other
similar agreements, including any master agreements between the Borrowers and
any Manufacturer ("DEALER FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS") other than those specifically
disclosed in Schedule 7.20, which schedule shows the Manufacturer and the
Borrower which is a party to each such agreement, the date such agreement was
entered into and the expiration date (if any) of each such agreement. Each of
the Dealer Franchise Agreements is currently in full force and effect, and no
Borrower has received any notice of termination with respect to any such
agreements; and, except as disclosed on Schedule 7.20, no Borrower is aware of
any event which with notice, lapse of time, or both would allow any Manufacturer
which is a party to any of the Dealer Franchise Agreements to terminate any such
agreements. There exists no actual or threatened termination, cancellation, or
limitation of, or any modification or change in, the business relationship
between any Borrower and any customer or any group of customers whose purchases
individually or in the aggregate are material to the business of such Borrower,
or with any material Manufacturer, and there exists no present condition or
state of facts or circumstances which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 7.21 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used
to support the issuance of Letters of Credit, for working capital and general
corporate purposes and for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Neither Agent
nor any Lender shall have any responsibility as to the use of any Letter of
Credit or any proceeds of the Loans. The Borrowers represent and warrant to the
Lenders and the Agent that all Loans will be for business, commercial,
investment or other similar purpose and not primarily for personal, family,
household or agricultural use, as such terms are used in the Texas Finance Code.

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

Lenders' interest. This insurance may, but need not, also protect the Company's
interest. If the Collateral becomes damaged, the coverage the Agent purchases
may not pay any claim the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes or any claim
made against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company may later
cancel this coverage by providing evidence that the Company has obtained
property coverage elsewhere.

                  (b) The Company is responsible for the cost of any insurance
purchased by the Agent. The cost of this insurance may be added to the
Obligations. If the cost is added to the Obligations, the interest rate provided
in Section 5.3 shall apply to such added amount. The effective date of coverage
may be the date the Company's prior coverage lapsed or the date the Company
failed to provide proof of coverage.

                  (c) The Company acknowledges that the coverage the Agent
purchases may be considerably more expensive than insurance the Company can
obtain on its own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or
any mandatory liability insurance requirements imposed by applicable law.

         Section 9.4 Obligations and Taxes. The Company will pay and discharge
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, when due, all
taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon the Company
or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, as well as all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies or otherwise unless and only to the extent that the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is contesting such taxes,
assessments and governmental charges, levies or claims in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and the Company or such Subsidiary has set aside on its
books such reserves or other appropriate provisions therefor as may be required
by GAAP.

         Section 9.5 Financial Statements; Reports. The Company will furnish to
the Agent and each Lender:

                  Portion, as increased by the Excess/Payments Overage Amount

                  as to cause the Borrowings with respect to any such Motor
                  Vehicles and/or Floor Plan Loans which are Out of Balance to
                  be in compliance with the Floor Plan Advance Limits. At such
                  time as no Excess/Payments Overage Amount exists, the
                  Excess/Payments in Process Portion shall be reduced to the
                  amount that existed immediately prior to the increase pursuant
                  to the existence of such Excess/Payments Overage Amount.

         Section 9.14 Disbursement Account. Any or all of the Floor Plan
Borrowers and the Floor Plan Agent, at various times, may be parties to a
corporate cash management service agreement (the "SERVICE AGREEMENT") providing
for a controlled disbursement account (the "DISBURSEMENT ACCOUNT") between such
Floor Plan Borrower and the Floor Plan Agent. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each such Floor Plan Borrower authorizes the Floor
Plan Agent to fund the Disbursement Account, on a daily basis if necessary, by
advancing Loans under this Agreement to the extent of availability under the
aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments. Each such Floor Plan Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that any requests for funding from the Disbursement
Account will not be paid unless funds in an amount sufficient to pay such
requests are then available for reborrowing in compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Section 2.1 hereof to enable Floor Plan
Agent to advance those funds to the Disbursement Account. Floor Plan Agent
agrees that any requests to be submitted for payment through the Disbursement
Account will not be made unless sufficient funds are available and such request
is made in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement to pay all
such requests. Each Floor Plan Borrower at all times is responsible for having
sufficient available funds in Excess/Payments in Process to pay all requests to
be paid through the Disbursement Account, whether these funds are advances under
this Agreement or otherwise. Each Floor Plan Borrower acknowledges and agrees
that the Service Agreement relating to the Disbursement Account may be canceled
by the Floor Plan Agent at any time upon written notice to the applicable Floor
Plan Borrower, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Service
Agreement. A copy of the form of Service Agreement may be attached to this
Agreement by the Floor Plan Agent at any time a Service Agreement is in effect
between a Floor Plan Borrower and the Floor Plan Agent, although the failure to
attach it shall not affect its validity or the effectiveness of this Agreement.

         Section 9.15 Further Assurances. The Company shall, and shall cause
each of the Borrowers to, to the extent applicable, execute, acknowledge,
deliver, and record or file such further instruments, including, without
limitation, further security agreements, financing statements, and continuation
statements, and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary, desirable,
or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, (i) causing any additions, substitutions,
replacements, or appurtenances to the Motor Vehicles financed hereunder to be
covered by and subject to the Liens created in this Agreement or the Documents
to which any Floor Plan Borrower is a party; and (ii) with respect to any Motor
Vehicles which are or are required to be subject to Liens created in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to which any Floor Plan Borrower is a
party, execute, acknowledge, endorse, deliver, procure, and record or file any
document or instrument, including, without limitation, any financing statement,
certificate of title, manufacturer's statement of origin, certificate of origin,
and dealer reassignment of any of the foregoing which are evidences of ownership
of such Motor Vehicles, deemed advisable by the Agent or the Floor Plan Agent to
protect the Liens granted in this Agreement or the Loan Documents to which any
of them respectively is a party and


                                      -72-

against the rights or interests of third persons, and the Company will pay all

holder or obligee) to accelerate (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), the maturity of any such Indebtedness; or any payment of principal or
interest, regardless of amount, on any Indebtedness of the Borrowers which
exceeds in the aggregate, an amount equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)
shall not be paid when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise

excess shall not have been vacated, discharged, stayed or bonded pending appeal
within sixty (60)

days from the entry thereof, excluding those judgments or decrees for and to the
extent which the Company or any such Subsidiary is insured and with respect to
which the insurer has assumed responsibility in writing (subject to usual
deductibles) or for and to the extent which the Company or any such Subsidiary
is otherwise indemnified if the terms of such indemnification are satisfactory
to the Required Lenders;

                  (k) there shall occur any material loss or change to any

except as permitted by the terms hereof or thereof or shall in any way be
terminated or become or be declared ineffective or inoperative or shall in any
way whatsoever cease to give or provide the respective Liens, security
interests, rights, titles, interests, remedies, powers or privileges intended to
be created thereby;

                  (m) an audit performed by the Floor Plan Agent pursuant to the
provisions of Section 9.12(a) reveals that (i) Motor Vehicles of the Borrowers
securing the Obligations have, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days been

then, and in any such event (other than an event with respect to the Company
described in Section 11.1(f) or Section 11.1(g)), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, (i) the Agent may, and at the request of
the Required Lenders shall, by written or telegraphic notice to the Company,

forthwith the Commitments of the Lenders hereunder (if not theretofore
terminated) and any such termination shall automatically constitute a
termination of the Swing Line Commitment, (y) declare the Notes then outstanding
to be forthwith due and payable and any such declaration shall automatically
constitute a declaration that the Swing Line Note is due and payable, whereupon
the principal of the Notes, and the Swing Line Note, together with accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Commitment Fees and all other
liabilities of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall become forthwith due and
payable both as to principal and interest, without presentment, demand, protest,
notice of protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or any
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrowers, anything contained herein or in any Note, the Swing Line Note or

request of the Required Lenders shall (and, to the extent the Commitments have
been terminated, such request shall be deemed to have been made), suspend and
terminate all Drafting Agreements; and in any event with respect to a Borrower
described in Section 11.1(f) or Section 11.1(g), the Commitments of the Lenders
shall automatically terminate (if not theretofore terminated) and any such
termination shall automatically constitute a termination of the Swing Line
Commitment, and the Notes and the Swing Line Note shall automatically become due
and payable, both as to principal and interest, without presentment, demand,
protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, anything
contained herein or in any Note, the Swing Line Note or other Loan Document to
the contrary notwithstanding and the Company and the other Borrowers shall
immediately deliver cash collateral to the Agent in such amounts as are
acceptable to the Agent to be held by the Agent, for the benefit of the Swing
Line Bank and the Lenders as Collateral for the payment and performance of
Drafting Agreements until all such Drafting Agreements are terminated according
to their terms.

         Section 11.2 Overdrawing of Floor Plan Loans. If at any time the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of all (i) Floor Plan Loans (including
Requests for Borrowings of Floor Plan Loans), plus (ii) Swing Line Loans, plus
(iii) Swing Line Overdraft Loans, plus (iv) Drafts presented for payment exceeds
(a) 110% of the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments and such condition exists
for two (2) consecutive days or (b) the aggregate Floor Plan Loan Commitments by
any amount for fifteen (15) days out of any 30-day period, then, in such event,
the Floor Plan Agent acting in its sole discretion may, and upon election of the
Required Lenders, shall (y) take any and all actions reasonably necessary to
suspend and/or terminate Drafts and (z) elect by written notice to the Company
to terminate the Floor Plan Commitments and to deem such occurrence as

                                  ARTICLE XII.
                 THE AGENT, FLOOR PLAN AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL

         Section 12.1 Authorization and Action of the Agent; Rights and Duties
Regarding Collateral, Priority of Distributions.

                  (a) In order to expedite the various transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each Lender, the Floor Plan Agent and the Swing Line Bank
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Chase to act as Agent on its behalf.
Each of the Lenders, the Floor Plan Agent and the Swing Line Bank and each
subsequent holder of any Note or the Swing Line Note by its acceptance thereof,
hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Agent to take such action on its
behalf and to exercise such powers hereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of the Agent by the terms and provisions hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent may perform any of its
duties hereunder by or through its agents and employees. The duties of the Agent
shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Agent shall not have by
reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in
respect of any Lender, the Floor Plan Agent or the Swing Line Bank; and nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, expressed or implied, is intended
to, or shall be so construed as to, impose upon the Agent any obligations in
respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except as expressly set
forth herein or therein. The Agent is hereby expressly authorized on behalf of
the Lenders, the Floor Plan Agent and the Swing Line Bank, without hereby
limiting any implied authority, (i) to receive on behalf of each of the Lenders
any payment of principal of or interest on the Notes outstanding hereunder and
all other amounts accrued hereunder paid to the Agent, and promptly to
distribute to each Lender its proper share of all payments so received; (ii) to
give notice within a reasonable time on behalf of each of the Lenders and the
Swing Line Bank to the Borrowers of any Default or Event of Default specified in
this Agreement of which the Agent has actual



                                      -84-
<PAGE>

knowledge as provided in Section 12.7; (iii) to distribute to each Lender and
the Swing Line Bank copies of all notices, agreements and other material as
provided for in this Agreement as received by the Agent; (iv) to distribute to
the Borrowers any and all requests, demands and approvals received by the Agent
or from the Lenders, and (v) to distribute and receive all notices, agreements
and other material as provided in this Agreement with respect to Floor Plan
Loans and to deal with the Floor Plan Agent to the fullest extent required or
contemplated by the terms of their Agreement or any other Loan Document. As to
any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Notes, the Swing
Line Note or the other Loan Documents (including enforcement or collection of
the Notes or the Swing Line Note), the Agent shall not be required to exercise
any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain
from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from
acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions
shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes, the Swing Line Note
and the Loans, the Floor Plan Agent and the Swing Line Bank; provided, however,
that the Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent
to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.

                  (b) The Agent shall hold all of the Collateral along with all
payments and proceeds arising therefrom, for the benefit of all Lenders and the
Swing Line Bank as security for the payment of all the Obligations subject to
the provisions of Section 12.1(d). Upon payment in full of all the Obligations,
the Agent shall release all of the Collateral to the Borrowers. Except as
otherwise expressly provided for in Section 13.5, the Agent, in its own name or
in the name of the Borrowers, may enforce any of the Security Documents or the
security therefor by any mode provided under the Loan Documents or by applicable
law, and may collect, receive and receipt for all proceeds receivable on account
of the Collateral.

                  (c) To the extent that the Collateral includes notes or other
instruments evidencing any monetary obligation to, or interest of any Borrower,
such Borrowers shall, if requested by the Agent, deliver to the Agent letters,
executed by such Borrower and approved by counsel for the Agent, notifying the
obligors to make payments directly to the Agent, such letters to be held by the
Agent and sent to such obligors at its discretion in accordance with Section
12.1(d) below. All payments and proceeds of every kind from the Collateral, when
directly received by the Agent pursuant to Section 12.1(d) (whether from
payments on or with respect to the Collateral, from foreclosure and sale to
third parties, from sale of Collateral subsequent to a foreclosure at which the
Agent or another Lender was the purchaser, or otherwise) shall be held by it as
a part of the Collateral and, except as otherwise expressly provided
hereinafter, shall be applied to the Obligations in the manner set forth in
Section 12.1(d).

                  (d) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and pursuant
to the procedures among the Lenders set forth in Section 12.1(e), the Agent,
after giving written notice to the Borrowers and to all Lenders and the Swing
Line Bank of the action(s) to be taken, may at any time or times thereafter (i)
deliver the various letters required by Section 12.1(c) hereof and receive
directly, for the benefit of the Lenders and Swing Line Bank and for reduction
of the Obligations as provided hereafter in this Section 12.1(d), all payments
and proceeds related to the Collateral and/or (ii) sell, assign and deliver all
of the Collateral or any part thereof, or any substitution therefor or any
additions thereto as provided hereafter. Any such sale or assignment may be at
any broker's board or at any public or private sale, at the option of the Agent
or of any officer or representative acting on behalf of the Agent, without
advertisement or any notice to the Borrowers or any other Person except those
required by applicable law (the Borrowers hereby agreeing that ten (10) days'
notice constitutes "reasonable notice"); and each Lender (including the Agent),
its officers and assigns, may bid and become purchasers at any such sale, if
public, or at any broker's board if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold
in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely
distributed standard price quotations. Sales hereunder may be at



                                      -85-
<PAGE>

such time or times, place or places, for cash or credit, and upon such terms and
conditions as the Agent may determine in its sole discretion. Upon the
completion of any sale, the Agent shall execute all instruments of transfer
necessary to vest in the purchaser(s) title to the property sold, and shall
deliver to such purchaser(s) any of the property so sold which may be in the
possession of the Agent.

         In the case of any sale or other liquidation of Collateral (other than
amounts already in the Cash Collateral Account, which amount shall be applied as
set forth in Section 6.8), the purchase money proceeds and avails and all other
proceeds which then may be held or recovered by the Agent or the Floor Plan
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Swing Line Bank, shall be applied
in the following order:

                           (i) First, to the payment of the reasonable costs and
                  expenses of such sale and of the collection or enforcement of
                  such Collateral, and of all reasonable expenses (including
                  attorneys' fees) and liabilities incurred and advances made by
                  the Lenders in connection therewith;

                           (ii) Second, to the payment of any amounts due to
                  Swing Line Bank in the form of Swing Line Overdraft Loans;

                           (iii) Third, to the payment of any amounts due to
                  Swing Line Bank in the form of Swing Line Loans;

                           (iv) Fourth, to the payment ratably of the amounts
                  due to the Lenders for first, interest and then to principal
                  on all Floor Plan Loans (other than Swing Line Loans and Swing
                  Line Overdraft Loans) then outstanding that were funded from
                  the Reserve Commitment, without preference or priority of such
                  Indebtedness owing to one Lender over another;

                           (v) Fifth, to the payment ratably of the amounts due
                  to the Lenders for first, interest and then to principal on
                  all Floor Plan Loans not paid pursuant to (iv) immediately
                  above, without preference or priority of such Indebtedness
                  owing to one Lender over another;

                           (vi) Sixth, to the payment ratably of the amounts due
                  to the Lenders for principal of and interest on all
                  Acquisition Loans (which include all Letter of Credit
                  Obligations) then outstanding, without preference or priority
                  of such Indebtedness owing to one Lender over another, or of
                  principal over interest, or of interest over principal;

                           (vii) Seventh, to the payment ratably of the amounts
                  due to the Lenders, without preference or priority of such
                  Indebtedness owing to one Lender over another, for (y) all
                  Obligations arising under any Hedging Agreement existing on
                  the Closing Date with respect to or covering Loans under this
                  Agreement in an aggregate amount for all such covered Loans
                  not to exceed at any time $75,000,000 and (z) Obligations
                  arising under any other Hedging Agreement covering Loans under
                  this Agreement; provided that the Lender entering into such
                  Hedging Agreement has delivered a written request for approval
                  of such Hedging Agreement to the Agent and each of the Lenders
                  and the Required Lenders approve such Hedging Agreement (and
                  the failure of any Lender to object in writing to such request
                  within five (5) business days of receipt of such request shall
                  be deemed approval) but excluding for the purposes of this
                  Section 12.1(d)(vii) all




                                      -86-
<PAGE>

                  Obligations arising under any Hedging Agreements which do not
                  conform to the requirements of subclauses (y) or (z) above
                  (such nonconforming Obligations, the "EXCESS HEDGING AGREEMENT
                  LIABILITY"); and

                           (viii) Eighth, to the payment of Excess Hedging
                  Agreement Liability owing to any of the Lenders without
                  preference or priority of such Indebtedness owing to one
                  Lender over another; and

                           (ix) Ninth, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
                  the Borrowers, their successors or assigns, or to whomsoever
                  may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of
                  competent jurisdiction may direct.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or in the Security Documents, all Lenders making Floor Plan Loans and all
Lenders making Acquisition Loans acknowledge that any proceeds resulting from
the sale or other realization of any Collateral (other than amounts already in
the Cash Collateral Account) shall be applied in the order described in Section
12.1(d), above, such that all Swing Line Overdraft Loans shall be paid before
Floor Plan Loans, all Floor Plan Loans shall be paid before Acquisition Loans,
all Acquisition Loans will be paid before any liabilities under any Hedging
Agreement Indebtedness conforming to the requirements of Section 12.1(d)(vii),
and that all such conforming Hedging Agreement Indebtedness shall be paid before
any Excess Hedging Agreement Liability. Such application will be made by the
Agent or the Floor Plan Agent based on either of their calculations of all of
such Indebtedness and the various classifications thereof, which calculations
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The intent of such classification
shall be to create a priority of payments in the order stated notwithstanding
that all of said Indebtedness is secured as a group by the Security Documents
and the Collateral described therein. All parties hereto recognize that the
provisions of Section 12.4 apply to the calculations and distributions made by
the Agent and the Floor Plan Agent hereunder.

                  (f) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default or an Event of Default, the Required Lenders shall meet to establish
written procedures to be taken by the Agent for the protection, collection and
enforcement of the Collateral. The Agent shall not act with respect to the
Collateral except in accordance with the written procedures as established by
the Required Lenders; however, if the Required Lenders fail to agree upon and
establish such procedures, and the exigency of the circumstances requires, the
Agent, in its sole discretion and in good faith, may (but is not required to)
take whatever action it deems necessary to protect and enforce the Collateral or
the rights of the Lenders and the Swing Line Bank under the Loan Documents. The
Borrowers shall acquire no rights or defenses under this Section 12.1(f).

                  (g) No Lender or the Swing Line Bank may enforce, or demand
enforcement of, any rights or Liens with respect to the Collateral except upon
the terms and conditions elsewhere stated in this Agreement.

         Section 12.2 Agent's Reliance, Etc.

                  (a) Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, the Notes, the Swing
Line Note or any of the other Loan Documents (i) with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders or (ii) in the absence of its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct (it being the express intention of the parties
hereto that the Agent and its directors, officers,



                                      -87-
<PAGE>

agents and employees shall have no liability for actions and omissions under
this Section 12.2 resulting from their sole ordinary or contributory
negligence).

                  (b) Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the
Agent: (i) may treat the payee of each Note, the Swing Line Note and the
Obligations of each Borrower hereunder and the Swing Line Bank, respectively, as
the holder thereof until the Agent receives written notice of the assignment or
transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the Agent;
(ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Borrower),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes
no warranty or representation to any Lender, the Swing Line Bank, or the Floor
Plan Agent and shall not be responsible to any Lender, the Swing Line Bank, or
the Floor Plan Agent for any statements, warranties or representations made in
or in connection with this Agreement, any Note, the Swing Line Note or any other
Loan Document; (iv) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, shall not
have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of
any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, any Note, the Swing
Line Note or any other Loan Document or to inspect the property (including the
books and records) of any Borrower; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender,
the Swing Line Bank or the Floor Plan Agent for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, collectability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of
this Agreement, any Note, the Swing Line Note, any other Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (vi) shall
not be responsible to any Lender, the Swing Line Bank or the Floor Plan Agent
for the perfection or priority of any Lien securing the Loans; and (vii) shall
incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement, any Note, the Swing
Line Note or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent,
certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram,
telecopier, cable or telex) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and signed
or sent by the proper party or parties.

         Section 12.3 Agent and Affiliates; Chase and Affiliates. Without
limiting the right of any other Lender or the Swing Line Bank to engage in any
business transactions with any Borrower or any of its Affiliates, with respect
to their Commitments, the Loans, if any, made by them, the Notes, and the Swing
Line Note, if any, issued to them, Chase shall have the same rights and powers
under this Agreement, any Note, the Swing Line Note or any of the other Loan
Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include Chase in its individual capacity. Chase and its Affiliates
may be engaged in, or may hereafter engage in, one or more loan, letter of
credit, leasing or other financing activities not the subject of the Loan
Documents (collectively, the "OTHER FINANCINGS") with any of Borrowers or any of
their Affiliates, or may act as trustee on behalf of, or depository for, or
otherwise engage in other business transactions with any of the Borrowers or any
of their Affiliates (all Other Financings and other such business transactions
being collectively, the "OTHER ACTIVITIES") with no responsibility to account
therefor to the Lenders or the Floor Plan Agent. Without limiting the rights and
remedies of the Lenders, the Swing Line Bank, or the Floor Plan Agent
specifically set forth in the Loan Documents, no other Lender, the Swing Line
Bank, nor the Floor Plan Agent shall have any interest in (a) any Other
Activities, (b) any present or future guarantee by or for the account of any
Borrower not contemplated or included in the Loan Documents, (c) any present or
future offset exercised by the Agent in respect of any such Other Activities,
(d) any present or future property taken as security for any such Other
Activities or (e) any property now or hereafter in the possession or control of
the Agent which may be or become security for the Obligations of any Borrower
under the Loan Documents by reason of the general description of indebtedness
secured, or of property contained in any other agreements, documents or
instruments related to such Other Activities; provided, however, that if any
payment in respect of such guarantees or such property or the proceeds thereof
shall be applied to reduction of the



                                      -88-
<PAGE>

Obligations evidenced hereunder and by the Notes, then each Lender, the Swing
Line Bank and the Floor Plan Agent shall be entitled to share in such
application according to its equitable portion of such Obligations.

         Section 12.4 Lenders' Indemnity of Agent.

                  (a) The Agent shall not be required to take any action
hereunder or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement, the
Notes, the Swing Line Note or any other Loan Document unless indemnified to the
Agent's satisfaction by the Lenders and the Swing Line Bank against loss, cost,
liability and expense. If any indemnity furnished to the Agent shall become
impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease to do the acts
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is given. In addition, the
Lenders and the Swing Line Bank agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrowers), ratably according to the respective aggregate
principal amounts of the Notes and the Swing Line Note then held by each of them
(or if no Notes are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective
Pro Rata Share of Total Commitments, or if no Commitments are outstanding, the
respective Pro Rata Share of Total Commitments immediately prior to the time the
Total Commitments ceased to be outstanding), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (or either of them) in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent under this Agreement, the Notes, the Swing Line Note and
the other Loan Documents (including any action taken or omitted under Article II
of this Agreement). Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender and the
Swing Line Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its
respective Pro Rata Share of the Total Commitments of any out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, the Notes, the
Swing Line Note and the other Loan Documents to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers. The provisions of this Section
12.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the payment of the Loans
and/or the assignment of any of the Notes and the Swing Line Note.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender or the Swing Line
Bank shall be liable under this Section 12.4 to the Agent for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements due to the Agent resulting from the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Lender and the Swing Line
Bank agrees, however, that it expressly intends, under this Section 12.4, to
indemnify the Agent ratably as aforesaid for all such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and
disbursements arising out of or resulting from the Agent's sole ordinary or
contributory negligence.

         Section 12.5 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender and the Swing Line
Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, the Floor Plan Agent or any other Lender or the Swing Line Bank and based
on the financial statements most recently delivered under either referred to in
Section 7.5 or Section 9.5 and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and the Swing Line Bank also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder.

         Section 12.6 Successor Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance
of a successor Agent as provided herein, the Agent may resign at any time by
giving thirty (30) days written notice thereof to the Lenders, the Swing Line
Bank, the Floor Plan Agent and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, subject,
prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default to
the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders,
approved by the Company, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Default or
an Event of Default and shall have accepted such appointment, all within thirty
(30) calendar days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation,
then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of
the United States or of any state thereof and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000). Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder and under the Notes by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
this Agreement and the Notes. After any retiring Agent's resignation as the
Agent hereunder and under the Notes, the provisions of this ARTICLE XII and
Section 13.4 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement and the Notes.

         Section 12.7 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender, the Swing
Line Bank, the Floor Plan Agent or the Borrowers referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default" or "notice of event of default," as applicable. If the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders, the
Swing Line Bank and the Floor Plan Agent and, if such notice is received from a
Lender, the Swing Line Bank or the Floor Plan Agent, the Agent shall give notice
thereof to the other Lenders, the Swing Line Bank and the Company. The Agent
shall be entitled to take action or refrain from taking action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as provided in Section 12.1 and Section 12.2.

         Section 12.8 Authorization and Action of the Floor Plan Agent.

                  (a) In order to expedite the various transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each Lender, the Swing Line Bank and the Agent hereby
irrevocably appoint and authorize Comerica Bank to act as Floor Plan Agent on
its behalf. Each of the Lenders, the Swing Line Bank and the Agent, and each
subsequent holder of any Note or the Swing Line Note by its acceptance thereof,
hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Floor Plan Agent to take such
action and to exercise such powers hereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of the Floor Plan Agent by the terms and provisions hereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Floor Plan Agent may
perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agents and employees. The
duties of the Floor Plan Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature;
the Floor Plan Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, the Swing Line
Bank or the Agent; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
expressed or implied, is intended to, or shall be so construed as to, impose
upon the Floor Plan Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein. The Floor
Plan Agent is hereby expressly authorized on behalf of the Lenders to (i)
receive and distribute funds, (ii) to receive and distribute all notices and
agreements and other material and (iii) to take all actions and perform such
duties and make such determinations, all as provided in this Agreement. As to
any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any Loan Document,
the Floor Plan Agent



                                      -90-
<PAGE>

shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall
not be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders, the Swing Line
Bank, the Agent and all holders of Notes and the Swing Line Note and the Loans
and the Floor Plan Agent; provided, however, that the Floor Plan Agent shall not
be required to take any action which exposes it to personal liability or which
is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.

                  (b) To the extent that any proceeds of the Motor Vehicles
constituting Collateral includes notes or other instruments evidencing any
monetary obligation to, or interest of, any Borrower, such Borrower shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Floor Plan Agent letters, executed by
such Borrower and approved by counsel for the Floor Plan Agent, notifying the
obligors to make payments directly to the Floor Plan Agent, such letters to be
held by the Floor Plan Agent and sent to such obligors at its discretion. All
payments and proceeds of every kind from such Motor Vehicles constituting
Collateral, when directly received by the Floor Plan Agent (whether from
payments on or with respect to proceeds of Motor Vehicles constituting
Collateral, from foreclosure and sale to third parties, from sale of Motor
Vehicles constituting Collateral subsequent to a foreclosure at which the Floor
Plan Agent or another Lender was the purchaser, or otherwise) shall be, except
as otherwise expressly provided hereinafter, applied to the Obligations in the
manner set forth in Section 12.1(d).

         Section 12.9 Floor Plan Agent's Reliance, Etc.

                  (a) Neither the Floor Plan Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to
be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement (i) with the
consent or at the request of the Required Lenders acting by and through the
Agent or (ii) in the absence of its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct (it being the express intention of the parties hereto that the Floor
Plan Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees shall have no
liability for actions and omissions under this Section 12.9 resulting from their
sole ordinary or contributory negligence).

                  (b) Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the
Floor Plan Agent: (i) may treat the Agent as Agent hereunder until the Floor
Plan Agent receives written notice of the appointment of a successor Agent as
provided in Section 12.6; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel
for the Borrowers), independent public accountants and other experts selected by
it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender, the Swing Line
Bank or the Agent and shall not be responsible to any Lender, the Swing Line
Bank or the Agent for any statements, warranties or representations made in or
in connection with this Agreement; (iv) except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance
or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, or
to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Borrower; (v)
shall not be responsible to any Lender, the Swing Line Bank or the Agent for the
due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, collectibility, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement, or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (vi) except as otherwise expressly
provided herein shall not be responsible to any Lender, the Swing Line Bank or
the Agent for the perfection or priority of any Lien securing the Loans; and
(vii) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement, by acting
upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may
be by telegram, telecopier, cable or telex) reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

         Section 12.10 Floor Plan Agent and Affiliates; Comerica Bank and
Affiliates. Without limiting the right of any other Lender, the Swing Line Bank
or the Agent to engage in any business transactions with any Borrower or any of
its Affiliates, with respect to their Commitments, the Loans, if any, made by
them and the Notes, if any, issued to them, Comerica Bank shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement, any Note, the Swing Line Note or any of
the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not the Floor Plan Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Comerica Bank in its individual
capacity. Unless prohibited hereby, Comerica Bank and its Affiliates may be
engaged in, or may hereafter engage in, one or more Other Financings with the
Company, any other Borrower or any of their Affiliates, or may act as trustee on
behalf of, or depository for, or otherwise engage in Other Activities with no
responsibility to account therefor to the Lenders or the Agent. Without limiting
the rights and remedies of the Lenders or the Agent specifically set forth in
the Loan Documents, no other Lender nor the Agent shall have any interest in (a)
any Other Activities, (b) any present or future guarantee by or for the account
of any of the Borrowers not contemplated or included in the Loan Documents, (c)
any present or future offset exercised by the Floor Plan Agent in respect of any
such Other Activities, (d) any present or future property taken as security for
any such Other Activities or (e) any property now or hereafter in the possession
or control of the Floor Plan Agent which may be or become security for the
Obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents by reason of the general
description of indebtedness secured, or of property contained in any other
agreements, documents or instruments related to such Other Activities; provided,
however, that if any payment in respect of such guarantees or such property or
the proceeds thereof shall be applied to reduction of the Obligations evidenced
hereunder and by the Notes or the Swing Line Note, then each Lender and the
Swing Line Bank shall be entitled to share in such application according to its
equitable portion of such Obligations.

         Section 12.11 Floor Plan Agent's Indemnity.

                  (a) The Floor Plan Agent shall not be required to take any
action hereunder or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this
Agreement, the Notes, the Swing Line Note, or any other Loan Document unless
indemnified to the Floor Plan Agent's satisfaction by the Lenders and the Swing
Line Bank, against loss, cost, liability and expense. If any indemnity furnished
to the Floor Plan Agent shall become impaired, it may call for additional
indemnity and cease to do the acts indemnified against until such additional
indemnity is given. In addition, the Lenders and the Swing Line Bank agree to
indemnify the Floor Plan Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers),
ratably according to the respective aggregate principal amounts of the Notes
then held by each of them (or if no Notes are at the time outstanding, ratably
according to the respective Pro Rata Share of Total Commitments, or if no
Commitments are outstanding, the respective Pro Rata Share of Total Commitments
immediately prior to the time the Total Commitments ceased to be outstanding),
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Floor Plan Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Floor Plan Agent under this
Agreement, the Notes, the Swing Line Note and the other Loan Documents
(including action taken or omitted under ARTICLE II or ARTICLE IV of this
Agreement). Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender and the Swing Line
Bank agrees to reimburse the Floor Plan Agent promptly upon demand for its
respective Pro Rata Share of the Total Commitments of any out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Floor Plan Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, administration, or enforcement of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
the Notes, the Swing Line Note and the other Loan Documents to the extent that
the Floor Plan Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers. The


                                      -92-
<PAGE>

provisions of this Section 12.11 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, the payment of the Loans and/or the assignment of any of the Notes or
the Swing Line Note.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender nor the Swing
Line Bank shall be liable under this Section 12.11 to the Floor Plan Agent for
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements due to the Floor
Plan Agent resulting from the Floor Plan Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Lender and the Swing Line Bank agrees, however, that it
expressly intends, under this Section 12.11, to indemnify the Floor Plan Agent
ratably as aforesaid for all such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements arising
out of or resulting from the Floor Plan Agent's sole ordinary or contributory
negligence.

         Section 12.12 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Floor Plan Agent, the Agent or
any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section
7.5 and Section 9.5 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and the Swing Line Bank also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Floor Plan Agent, the Swing Line
Bank, the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder.

         Section 12.13 Successor Floor Plan Agent. Subject to the appointment
and acceptance of a successor Floor Plan Agent as provided herein, the Floor
Plan Agent may resign at any time by giving written thirty (30) days notice
thereof to the Lenders, the Agent and the Company. Prior to the effectiveness of
the termination of the existing Floor Plan Agent, the Floor Plan Agent shall
also be terminated as Swing Line Bank and all Swing Line Loans, Swing Line
Overdraft Loans outstanding as of such date and all amounts funded by the Floor
Plan Agent pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof shall be purchased by the Successor
Floor Plan Agent, and all of the obligations of the Floor Plan Agent pursuant to
any drafting agreements issued by the Floor Plan Agent pursuant to Section 2.8
hereof shall have been irrevocably assumed by the Successor Floor Plan Agent,
and the Successor Floor Plan Agent shall have agreed to indemnify the existing
Floor Plan Agent in connection with any costs, liabilities or obligations
arising out of, or in any way connected with, the transfer of such drafting
agreements to the Successor Floor Plan Agent. Upon any such resignation or
termination, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Floor Plan Agent, subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Floor Plan Agent shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders, approved by the Company and shall have
accepted such appointment, all within thirty (30) calendar days after the
resignation or termination of the Floor Plan Agent, then the Agent shall, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Floor Plan Agent, which shall be a
commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States or of
any state thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least Five
Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000). Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as Floor Plan Agent hereunder, such successor Floor Plan Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Floor Plan Agent, and the retiring Floor Plan Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any
retiring Floor Plan Agent's resignation as the Floor Plan Agent hereunder, the
provisions of this ARTICLE XII and Section 13.4 shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Floor Plan Agent
under this Agreement.

         Section 12.14 Notice of Default. The Floor Plan Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default hereunder unless the Floor Plan Agent shall have received notice from a
Borrower, a Lender or the Swing Line Bank, stating that such Default or Event of
Default has occurred and stating that such notice is a "notice of default or
"notice of event of default", as applicable. If the Floor Plan Agent receives
such a notice, the Floor Plan Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders,
the Swing Line Bank and the Agent. If the Floor Plan Agent receives such a
notice, the Floor Plan Agent shall be entitled to take action or refrain from
taking action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as provided in
Section 12.8 and Section 12.9.

available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee together with the Note subject
to such assignment, the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section
13.3(b) and, if required, the Company's written consent to such assignment, the
Agent shall (subject to the consent of the Company to such assignment, if
required), if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in the
form of Exhibit 13.3(b), (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record
the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Company and the Lenders. Within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of notice, the Company, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver
and shall cause each of the other Borrowers to execute and deliver to the Agent
in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible
Assignee in an amount equal to the assigning Lender's Commitment assumed by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, and a new Note to the order of the
assigning Lender in an amount equal to the portion of its Commitment retained by
the assigning Lender hereunder. Such new Notes shall be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered
Note, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and
shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit 1.1C. Each canceled Note
shall be promptly returned to the Company.

                  (f) Each Lender may without the consent of any Borrower or the
Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it and the Note held by it);
provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating
banks or other entities shall be entitled to the cost protection provisions and
Tax indemnities contained in Article V only to the same extent that the Lender
from which such participating bank or other entity acquired its participation
would be entitled to the benefit of such cost protection provisions and Tax
indemnities and (iv) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce the Obligations of any of the Borrowers
relating to the Loans and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications or waivers
with respect to any fees payable hereunder or the amount of principal of or the
rate at which interest is payable on the Loans, or the dates fixed for payments
of principal of or interest on the Loans).

                  (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 13.3, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant, any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such
Lender by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers; provided that prior to any such
disclosure, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree (subject to customary exceptions, including without
limitation the provisions of Section 13.19) to preserve the confidentiality of
any confidential information relating to any Borrower received from such Lender.

                  (h) Anything in this Section 13.3 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of any Borrower
or the Agent, assign and pledge all or any portion of its Commitment and the
Loans owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board and any Operating
Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release
the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

                  (i) All transfers of any interest in any Note hereunder shall
be in compliance with all federal and state securities laws, if applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, however, the



                                      -97-
<PAGE>

parties to this Agreement do not intend that any transfer under this Section
13.13 be construed as a "purchase" or "sale" of a "security" within the meaning
of any applicable federal or state securities laws.

         Section 13.4 Expenses of the Lenders; Indemnity.

                  (a) The Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by the Agent and the Floor Plan Agent in connection
with the preparation of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents
or with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
(whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be consummated) or
reasonably incurred by the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent or any Lender in
connection with the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with
this Agreement or with the Loans made or the Notes issued hereunder, including
the reasonable fees and disbursements of the counsel for the Agents and Bodman,
Longley & Dahling, LLP, special counsel for the Floor Plan Agent, and, in
connection with such enforcement or protection, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of other counsel for any Lender, including allocated staff counsel
costs for any Lender that elects to use the services of staff counsel in lieu of
outside counsel. The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Lenders from and hold them
harmless against any documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any
Governmental Authority by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or any of the Notes or other Loan Documents.

                  (b) THE BORROWERS EACH AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE AGENT, THE FLOOR
PLAN AGENT AND THE LENDERS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
AND AGENTS (EACH SUCH PERSON BEING CALLED AN "INDEMNITEE") AGAINST, AND TO HOLD
THE LENDERS AND SUCH OTHER INDEMNITEE HARMLESS FROM, ANY AND ALL LOSSES, CLAIMS,
DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE COUNSEL FEES AND
EXPENSES, INCURRED BY OR ASSERTED AGAINST ANY INDEMNITEE ARISING OUT OF, IN ANY
WAY CONNECTED WITH, OR AS A RESULT OF (I) THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE PERFORMANCE BY
THE PARTIES HERETO AND THERETO OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER AND
THEREUNDER (INCLUDING THE MAKING OF THE COMMITMENT OF EACH LENDER) AND
CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, (II) THE USE
OF PROCEEDS OF THE LOANS OR (III) ANY CLAIM, LITIGATION, INVESTIGATION OR
PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER OR NOT ANY INDEMNITEE IS A
PARTY THERETO; PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY LENDER, APPLY
TO ANY SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES THAT ARE
DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE
JUDGMENT TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF
SUCH INDEMNITEE. THE BORROWERS AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THEY EXPRESSLY INTEND TO
INDEMNIFY EACH INDEMNITEE FROM AND HOLD EACH OF THEM HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND
ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE ORDINARY
SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH INDEMNITEE, BUT NOT THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNITEE OR TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING ARISING
SOLELY BY REASON OF CLAIMS BETWEEN THE LENDERS OR ANY LENDER AND THE AGENT OR
THE FLOOR PLAN AGENT.

<PAGE>

                  (c) The provisions of this Section 13.4 shall remain operative
and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 13.4 shall be payable
within ten (10) days following receipt by the Company of a detailed invoice or
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such claim and the
amounts so expended or lost or the amount of damages so incurred.

                  (d) No Indemnitee may settle any claim to be indemnified
without prior written notice to the Company; provided however, failure to
provide such prior written notice shall in no way affect the settlement of such
claims.

                  (e) In the case of any indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnitee shall give notice to the Company of any such claim or demand being
made against the Indemnitee and the Company may participate in such proceeding
at its own expense if legal counsel to the Company is acceptable to the Agent.

         Section 13.5 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and the Swing Line Bank are hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender, the Swing Line Bank or any branch Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers against
any of and all the Obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement and the Note held by such Lender and the Swing Line Bank,
respectively, according to their respective rights as otherwise provided herein,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such Note and although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender and the Swing Line Bank agree promptly to notify the Borrowers after any
such setoff and application, but the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender
and the Swing Line Bank under this Section 13.5 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender and the Swing
Line Bank may have under applicable law. Each Lender hereby specifically agrees
that in order to ensure that it has control over said deposit accounts (as
defined in the UCC), it will act in accordance with the instructions from the
Administrative Agent in regard to the disposition of the funds in said deposit
accounts without further consent from any Borrower.

         Section 13.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

                  (a) This Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents and
all other documents executed in connection herewith, shall be deemed to be
contracts and agreements executed by the Borrowers, the Agent, the Floor Plan
Agent and the Lenders under the laws of the State of Texas and of the United
States of America and for all purposes shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of said state and of the United States
of America. Without limitation of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, the
Notes or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any
rights which any Lender may have under applicable federal legislation relating
to the amount of interest which such Lender may contract for, take, receive, or
charge in respect of any Loans, including any right to contract for, take,
receive, reserve and charge interest at the rate allowed by the law of the state
where such Lender is located. If and to the extent the laws of the State of
Texas are applicable for purposes of determining the Highest Lawful Rate, such
term shall mean the "weekly ceiling" from time to time in effect under Section
303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended



                                      -99-
<PAGE>

(the "ACT"), or, if permitted by applicable law and effective upon the giving of
the notices required by the Act (or effective upon any other date otherwise
specified by applicable law), the "monthly", "quarterly" or "annualized" ceiling
from time to time in effect under the Act, whichever Agent shall elect to
substitute for the "weekly ceiling," and vice versa, each such substitution to
have the effect provided in the Act, and Agent shall be entitled to make such
election from time to time one or more times and, without notice to Borrower, to
leave any such substitute rate in effect for subsequent periods in accordance
with the Act. The provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as
amended, do not apply to this Agreement or any Note issued hereunder.

                  (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably submits generally and
unconditionally for itself and in respect of its property to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any Texas state court, or any United States federal court,
sitting in the City of Houston or County of Harris, Texas, and to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any state or United States federal court sitting
in the state in which any of the Collateral is located, over any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Obligations. Each
Borrower hereby agrees and consents that, in addition to any methods of service
of process provided for under applicable law, all service of process in any such
suit, action or proceeding in any Texas state court, or any United States
federal court, sitting in the City of Houston or County of Harris, Texas may be
made by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, directed to such
Borrower at its address stated in Section 13.1, or at a subsequent address of
which the Agent received actual notice from such Borrower in accordance with
this Agreement, and service so made shall be complete five (5) days after the
same shall have been so mailed. Each Borrower, to the extent it is not qualified
to do business in Texas, hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers
the Company, with offices at 950 Echo Lane, Suite #100, Houston, Texas 77024, as
its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on
its behalf, and in respect of its property, service of any and all legal
process, summons, notices and documents which may be served in any such action
or proceedings.

         Section 13.7 Waivers; Amendments.

                  (a) No failure or delay of the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent or
any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent and
the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement,
the Notes or the other Loan Documents or consent to any departure by the
Borrowers therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
authorized as provided in Section 13.7(b), and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
No notice or demand on the Borrowers in any case shall entitle the Borrowers to
any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Each
holder of any Note shall be bound by any amendment, modification, waiver or
consent authorized as provided herein, whether or not such Note shall have been
marked to indicate such amendment, modification, waiver or consent.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement, any Note, any Loan Document nor
any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except
pursuant to a written agreement or agreements entered into by the Borrowers and
the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall (i) change
the principal amount of, or extend or advance the maturity of or any date for
the payment of any principal of or interest on, any Loan, or waive or excuse any
such payment or any part thereof, or,



                                     -100-
<PAGE>

except as provided in this Agreement, decrease the rate of interest on any Loan,
or the amount of any fees payable to any Lender without the written consent of
each Lender affected thereby, (ii) change the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender or change the Commitment Fees of any Lender
without the written consent of each Lender, or change the amount of the Total
Commitment without the consent of each Lender (except in accordance with Section
5.18), (iii) release or defer the granting or perfecting of a Lien in any
Collateral or release any guaranty or similar undertaking provided by any Person
or modify any indemnity provided to the Lenders hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents without the written consent of each Lender; provided however the
Agent or the Floor Plan Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to release
any Collateral or any guaranty which a Borrower is permitted to sell or transfer
or otherwise release under the terms of this Agreement or any Loan Document
without notice to or any further action or consent of the Lenders; or (iv) amend
or modify the provisions of this Section 13.7, Section 13.3(a), Section 4.6(b),
Section 12.1(d), Section 10.1(m)(iii), Section 6.7(a) or the definition of the
"Required Lenders" without the written consent of each Lender; and provided
further that no such agreement shall amend, modify, waive or otherwise affect
the rights or duties of the Agent or the Floor Plan Agent hereunder without the
written consent of the Agent or the Floor Plan Agent, respectively; and provided
further that no such agreement shall (i) amend or modify or waive any default
with respect to the provisions of Section 5.18, Section 10.1(m) (except for
Section 10.1(m)(iii)), the definition of "Permitted New Vehicle Floor Plan
Indebtedness," the definition of "Subordinated Indebtedness," Section 10.13(a),
Section 10.14, Section 10.15, Section 10.16 or Section 10.17 except pursuant to
a written agreement entered into by the Borrowers and the Supermajority Lenders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may execute and deliver to any Borrower
releases of chattel paper sold to any provider of Permitted New Vehicle Floor
Plan Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the intercreditor agreement
executed in connection herewith between the Agent and any such provider. Each
Lender and each holder of any Note shall be bound by any modification or
amendment authorized by this Section 13.7 regardless of whether its Note shall
be marked to make reference thereto, and any consent by any Lender or holder of
a Note pursuant to this Section 13.7 shall bind any Person subsequently
acquiring a Note from it, whether or not such Note shall be so marked.

         Section 13.8 Interest. Each provision in this Agreement and each other
Loan Document is expressly limited so that in no event whatsoever shall the
amount contracted for, charged, paid, or otherwise agreed to be paid, or
received to the Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the
money to be loaned under this Agreement or any Loan Document or otherwise
(including any sums paid as required by any covenant or obligation contained
herein or in any other Loan Document which is for the use, forbearance or
detention of such money), exceed that amount of money which would cause the
effective rate of interest to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, and all amounts
owed under this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be held to be
subject to reduction to the effect that such amounts so paid or agreed to be
paid which are for the use, forbearance or detention of money under this
Agreement or such Loan Document shall in no event exceed that amount of money
which would cause the effective rate of interest to exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate. Anything in this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding, none of the Borrowers shall ever be required to pay
unearned interest on any Note and shall never be required to pay interest on
such Note at a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and if the effective
rate of interest which would otherwise be payable under this Agreement, such
Note and the other Loan Documents would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, or if
the holder of such Note shall receive any unearned interest or shall receive
monies that are deemed to constitute interest which would increase the effective
rate of interest payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement, such Note or
Loan Document to a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then (a) the
amount of interest which would otherwise be payable by the Borrowers under this
Agreement, such Note or any Loan Document shall be reduced to the amount allowed
under applicable



                                     -101-
<PAGE>

law, and (b) any unearned interest paid by the Borrowers or any interest paid by
the Borrowers in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate shall be credited on the
principal of such Note (or, if the principal amount of such Note shall have been
paid in full, refunded to the Borrowers). It is further agreed that, without
limitation of the foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest contracted
for, charged or received by any Lender under the Notes held by it, or under this
Agreement, are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the
Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender (such Highest Lawful Rate being
such Lender's "MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE RATE"), and shall be made, to the extent
permitted by usury laws applicable to such Lender (now or hereafter enacted), by
amortizing, prorating and spreading in equal parts during the period of the full
stated term of the Loans evidenced by said Notes all interest at any time
contracted for, charged or received by such Lender in connection therewith. If
at any time and from time to time (i) the amount of interest payable to any
Lender on any date shall be computed at such Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate
pursuant to this Section 13.8 and (ii) in respect of any subsequent interest
computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to such Lender would
be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender computed at such
Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate, then the amount of interest payable to such
Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue
to be computed at such Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate until the total amount
of interest payable to such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest
which would have been payable to such Lender if the total amount of interest had
been computed without giving effect to this Section 13.8.

         Section 13.9 Severability; Conflicts.

                  (a) In the event any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document should be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good
faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions
with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible
to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

                  (b) In the event any of the terms and provisions of any other
Loan Document are inconsistent with the terms and provisions set forth in this
Agreement, the terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement shall prevail.

         Section 13.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which
when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 13.11.

         Section 13.11 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective on
the Closing Date, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of each Borrower, the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent and each Lender and their
respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower shall have the right
to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein except as provided in
Section 13.3(a).

         Section 13.12 Further Assurances. Each Borrower shall make, execute or
endorse, and acknowledge and deliver or file or cause the same to be done, all
such vouchers, invoices, notices, certifications and additional agreements,
undertakings, transfers, assignments, financing statements or other assurances,
and take any and all such other action, as the Agent or the Floor Plan Agent
may, from time to time, deem reasonably necessary or proper in connection with
any of the Loan Documents, the Obligations of the Borrowers thereunder or for
better assuring and confirming unto the Lenders all or any part of the security
for any of such Obligations.



                                     -102-
<PAGE>

         Section 13.13 Subsidiary Solvency Savings Clause. Each of the Borrowers
acknowledges the receipt and acceptance of valuable consideration as of the
Closing Date and thereafter in connection with this Agreement; and each Borrower
further acknowledges and agrees that the direct benefits and enrichment it
derives from being a party to this Agreement constitute a reasonably equivalent
value to it in exchange for the joint and several liability it has incurred
pursuant to this the Agreement. Further, each of the Borrowers acknowledges the
interdependence by and among the other Borrowers in successfully carrying out
their business operations. Each of the Borrowers represents that it is solvent
prior to entering into this Agreement and that the transactions completed hereby
will not render it insolvent; provided, however in the event that the
Indebtedness incurred by any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby would constitute a "fraudulent transfer" as to
any such Borrower under Section 548 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or pursuant
to any applicable state law governing "fraudulent transfers" because such
Borrower is deemed to have become insolvent as a result of incurring such
Indebtedness, then, in such event, the liability of any such Borrower hereunder
shall be deemed for all purposes to be equal to one dollar less than that amount
of Indebtedness which would not render such Borrower insolvent.

         Section 13.14 Joint and Several Liability and Related Matters.

                  (a) Each of Floor Plan Borrowers other than the Company
authorizes the Company with full power and authority as attorney-in-fact, to
execute and deliver Requests for Borrowings, requests for issuance of Letters of
Credit and each other instrument, certificate and report to be delivered by any
Floor Plan Borrower to the Agent, the Floor Plan Agent and the Lenders pursuant
to this Agreement or any Loan Document. Each of the Floor Plan Borrowers other
than the Company agrees that it shall be bound by any action taken by the
Company on its behalf pursuant to such appointment.

                  (b) The obligations of each of the Ford Borrowers under this
Agreement and the Loan Documents shall be joint and several only with all other
Ford Borrowers and the liability of each of the Ford Borrowers shall be limited
to an amount equal to the Ford Borrower Liability Amount and the Collateral of
all Ford Borrowers granted or pledged to the Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders to secure the Obligations shall secure only that portion of the
Obligations attributable to all of the Ford Borrowers as hereinabove provided.
The obligations of each of the GM Borrowers under this Agreement and the Loan
Documents shall be joint and several with all the Borrowers and (except as
provided in the GM Borrower Guaranty executed by each of the GM Borrowers) the
liability of each of the GM Borrowers shall be limited to an amount equal to the
GM Borrower Liability Amount and the Collateral of all GM Borrowers granted or
pledged to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to secure the Obligations
shall secure only that portion of the Obligations attributable to all of the GM
Borrowers as hereinabove provided. Subject to Section 13.13, the obligations of
all other Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are joint
and several and not limited in any way whatsoever.

                  (c) Except as herein provided, each Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that it is the intent of the parties that each Borrower be primarily
liable for the obligations as a joint and several obligor. It is the intention
of the parties that, except as herein provided, with respect to liability of any
Borrower hereunder arising solely by reason of its being jointly and severally
liable for Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations and other extensions of credit
taken by other Borrowers, the obligations of such Borrower shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of:

                           (i) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability
                  of this Agreement, any Note or any Loan Document as to any
                  other Borrower;


                                     -103-
<PAGE>

                           (ii) the failure of any Lender or any holder of any
                  Note:

                                    (A) to enforce any right or remedy against
                           any Borrower or any other Person (including any
                           surety) under the provisions of this Agreement, such
                           Note or otherwise, or

                                    (B) to exercise any right or remedy against
                           any surety of, or Collateral securing, any
                           obligations;

                           (iii) any change in the time, manner or place of
                  payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
                  Obligations, or any other extension, compromise or renewal of
                  any Obligations;

                           (iv) any reduction, limitation, impairment or
                  termination of any Obligations with respect to any other
                  Borrower for any reason, including any claim of waiver,
                  release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be
                  subject to (and each Borrower hereby waives any right to or
                  claim of) any defense (other than the defense of payment in
                  full of the Obligations) or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment
                  or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity,
                  illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity, compromise,
                  unenforceability of, or any other event or occurrence
                  affecting, any Obligations with respect to any other Borrower;

                           (v) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or
                  nonperfection of any Collateral, or any amendment to or waiver
                  or release or addition of, or consent to departure from, any
                  guaranty, held by any Lender or any holder of the Notes
                  securing any of the Obligations; or

                           (vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise
                  constitute a defense (other than the defense of payment in
                  full of the Obligations) available to, or a legal or equitable
                  discharge of, any other Borrower, any surety or any guarantor.


                  (d) Each Borrower agrees that its liability hereunder
including, without limitation, any joint and several liability of such Borrower,
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time any payment (in whole or in part) of any of the Obligations is rescinded or
must be restored by any Lender or any holder of any Note, upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower as though such payment had not been
made.

                  (e) Each Borrower hereby expressly waives: (i) notice of the
Lenders' acceptance of this Agreement; (ii) notice of the existence or creation
or non payment of all or any of the Obligations other than notices expressly
provided for in this Agreement; (iii) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor,
protest, and all other notices whatsoever other than notices expressly provided
for in this Agreement; and (iv) all diligence in collection or protection of or
realization upon the Obligations or any part thereof, any obligation hereunder,
or any security for or guaranty of any of the foregoing, subject, however, in
the case of Collateral in the possession of the Agent or a Lender to such
Person's duty to use reasonable care in the custody and preservation of such
Collateral.

                  (f) No delay on any of the Lenders' part in the exercise of
any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial
exercise by any of the Lenders of any right or remedy shall preclude other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. No action
of



                                     -104-
<PAGE>

any of the Lenders permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair any
such Lenders' rights or any Borrower's Obligations under this Agreement.

                  (g) Each Borrower hereby represents and warrants to each of
the Lenders that it now has and will continue to have independent means of
obtaining information concerning the Borrowers' affairs, financial condition and
business. The Lenders shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Borrower with any credit or other information concerning the Borrowers' affairs,
financial condition or business which may come into the Lenders' possession.

PLAN AGENT AND EACH OF THE BORROWERS AFTER CONSULTING OR HAVING HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY
WAIVE ANY RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION BASED
UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, DEALING,
STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTION OF ANY OF THEM. NEITHER THE
LENDERS, THE AGENT, FLOOR PLAN AGENT NOR ANY OF THE BORROWERS SHALL SEEK TO
CONSOLIDATE, BY COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE, ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT
BEEN WAIVED. THESE PROVISIONS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY
RESPECT OR RELINQUISHED BY THE LENDERS, THE AGENT, THE FLOOR PLAN AGENT OR ANY
OF THE BORROWERS EXCEPT BY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT EXECUTED BY ALL OF THEM.

fees outstanding under the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement for the account

                  (b) each Letter of Credit outstanding under the Fourth Amended

security interests and Liens granted by it under each of the Security Documents
to which it is a party; and

                  (e) the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement and the
Commitments thereunder shall terminate and be superseded by this Agreement.

Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or
have been provided to such Lender relating to such tax treatment or tax
structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in
either case contains information concerning such tax treatment or tax structure
of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
