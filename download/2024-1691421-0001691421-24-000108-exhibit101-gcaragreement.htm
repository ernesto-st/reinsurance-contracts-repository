Commencing on the Effective Date and  ending upon the expiration of the Availability Period, Company may from time to time make an  offer for Investors to invest in a Reference Cohort for the subsequent Growth Period by delivering  to Arranger a request substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (each, an &quot;Investment  Request&quot;).  (b) Obligation of Arranger to Facilitate Advances.  Subject to  Company meeting each of the conditions outlined in the Specified Commercial Terms contained  in Section 2.1 of Schedule A attached hereto, during the Commitment Period, Arranger shall  accept an offer for investment in a Reference Cohort set forth in an Investment Request by  execution thereof and delivery of the related countersigned Investment Request to Company within  five (5) Business Days of its receipt thereof.  Upon any such acceptance of an Investment Request  by Arranger, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, at Arranger's sole discretion) of the conditions  precedent set forth in Section 3.2 hereof, on the related Investment Funding Date, Arranger shall  facilitate the funding by one (1) or more Investors of the related Investment Amount to Company  by wire transfer to the account designated by Company within five (5) Business Days of the date  of acceptance and shall thereafter be entitled to payment from Company of an amount up to the  Investor Cap Amount with respect to the Invested Receivables.  Except for the indemnification  obligations of Company under Section 7, and Company's other express payment obligations  hereunder, each investment in the Invested Receivables shall entitle the related Investors solely to  the investment return, if any, until the date that the Outstanding Investor Share attributable to the  Reference Cohort corresponding to such investment is equal to $0.00.  Subject to Section 2.1(d),  the Investment Amount for each Growth Period shall be adjusted to account for any Growth Excess  Spend or Growth Underspend, as applicable.  Any such adjustment or any additional adjustment  required to account for any applicable Spend Reconciliation shall be evidenced by a Funding  Adjustment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure by Arranger to facilitate a Funding  Adjustment for any Growth Excess Spend, Growth Underspend or other applicable Spend  Reconciliation shall not constitute a waiver of amounts due to related Investors of Reference  Income.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Arranger shall be required to accept no  more than one (1) Investment Request per Growth Period.  As of the Effective Date, Arranger  expects that the Investors for future Investment Requests will be as set forth on Schedule D;  provided, that the actual Investors for an Investment Amount will in all cases be as reflected on  the executed Investment Request delivered by Arranger in connection therewith.  Arranger also  may deliver an updated Schedule D at any time to reflect changes in expectations regarding the  Investors that will fund future Investment Amounts.  (c) Sharing of Reference Income.  Upon funding an Investment  Amount during any Growth Period, the related Investors will be entitled to, and Company hereby  agrees to remit to Arranger, on behalf of such Investors, in accordance with the terms hereof, the  applicable Investor Sharing Percentage of all Reference Income from the Reference Cohort  associated with such Growth Period until such Investors have received Reference Income from  such Reference Cohort equal to the Investor Cap Amount.

The  foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the case of any claims, losses or liabilities to the extent  resulting solely from the gross negligence, bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct of an Indemnified  Party.  Company will have the right at any time to conduct and control the defense of, negotiate,  settle or otherwise control any claims pursuant to this Section 7.1 and to select counsel of  reasonable experience and expertise in the relevant area(s) of law implicated by such claims;  provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include Company and Arranger and  the Indemnified Parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available  to it or them and/or other Indemnified Parties that are different from or additional to those available  to Company or that such that joint representation of the parties would create an ethical conflict of  interest for counsel, the Indemnified Party or parties shall have the right to elect for the Indemnified  Parties to be represented by one (1) separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise  participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party or parties.  Company  agrees that it shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any  pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could reasonably  have been a party and indemnity could reasonably have been sought hereunder by such  Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified  Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include  a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such  Indemnified Party.  7.2 Tax Indemnification.
