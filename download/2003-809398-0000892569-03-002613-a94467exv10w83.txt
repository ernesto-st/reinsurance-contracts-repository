The Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide a revolving credit facility,

herein.

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.
                        DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS

         1.01 DEFINED TERMS. As used in this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the meanings set forth below:

"Acquired Cash Flow" means, for any period, (a) Available Dividends of any
Person or assets acquired by a Subsidiary which is an Insurance Subsidiary in a
Permitted Acquisition during such period, plus (b) EBITDA of any Person or
assets acquired by a Subsidiary which is a non-Insurance Subsidiary in a
Permitted Acquisition during such period and available to be paid as dividends
to the Borrower under applicable Law, in either case as determined on a pro
forma basis for such period as if consummation of such Permitted Acquisition
occurred on the first day of such period.

"Acquisition" means any transaction or series of related transactions for the
purpose of or resulting, directly or indirectly, in (a) the acquisition of all
or substantially all of the assets of a Person, or of any business or division
of a Person, (b) the acquisition of in excess of 50% of the Equity Interests of
any Person, or otherwise causing any Person to become a Subsidiary or (c) a
merger or consolidation or any other combination with another Person (other than
with a Person that is a Subsidiary); provided that the Borrower or one of its
Subsidiaries is the surviving entity.

"Administrative Agent" means Bank of America in its capacity as administrative
agent under any of the Loan Documents, or any successor administrative agent.

"Administrative Agent's Office" means the Administrative Agent's address and, as
appropriate, account as set forth on Schedule 10.02, or such other address or
account as the Administrative Agent may from time to time notify the Borrower
and the Lenders.

"Administrative Questionnaire" means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form
supplied by the Administrative Agent.

"Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, another Person that directly, or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or
is under common Control with the Person specified. "Control" means the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management or policies of a Person, whether through the ability
to exercise voting power, by contract or otherwise. "Controlling" and
"Controlled" have meanings correlative thereto. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, a Person shall be deemed to be Controlled by another Person if
such other Person possesses, directly or indirectly, power to vote 10% of the
Voting Stock of such Person.

"Agent-Related Persons" means the Administrative Agent, together with its
Affiliates (including, in the case of Bank of America in its capacity as the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger), and the officers, directors, employees,
agents and attorneys-in-fact of such Persons and Affiliates.

"Aggregate Commitments" means the Commitments of all the Lenders.

"Agreement" means this Credit Agreement.

"Annual Statement" means the annual financial statement of any insurance company
as required to be filed with the Department, together with all exhibits or
schedules filed therewith, prepared in conformity with SAP. References to
amounts on particular exhibits, schedules, lines, pages and columns of such
Annual Statements are based on the formats promulgated by the NAIC for 2002
Annual Statements for the applicable type of insurance company. If such format
is changed in future years so that different information is contained in such
items or they no longer exist, it is understood that the reference is to
information consistent with that recorded in the referenced item in the 2002
Annual Statement of the insurance company.

                      THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

         2.01     REVOLVING LOANS. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Revolving
Loan") to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the
Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that
after giving effect to any Revolving Borrowing, (i) the Outstandings shall not
exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's
Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, and subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section
2.01, prepay under Section 2.04, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Revolving
Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided
herein.

         2.02     BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF REVOLVING LOANS.

         (a)      Each Revolving Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans
from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent,
which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to
the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate
Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.

Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) must be
confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written
Revolving Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(b)
and (c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof. Each Revolving Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall
specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Revolving Borrowing, a
conversion of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or
continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the
principal amount of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv)
the Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Revolving Loans
are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period
with respect thereto.

If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Revolving Loan in a Revolving Loan
Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion
or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Loans shall be made as, or
converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans
shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with
respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a
Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any
such Revolving Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be
deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

         (b)      Following receipt of a Revolving Loan Notice, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro
Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely notice of a
conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a
<PAGE>

Revolving Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan
available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the
Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day
specified in the applicable Revolving Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the
initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all
funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of
such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and
reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided,
however, that if, on the date the Revolving Loan Notice with respect to such
Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are Swing Line Loans outstanding, then
the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full
of any such Swing Line Loans, and second, to the Borrower as provided above.

         (c)      Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan
may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders.

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans
are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the
Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

         (e)      After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all
conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations
of Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than five Interest
Periods in effect with respect to Revolving Loans.

         2.03     SWING LINE LOANS.

         (a)      The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Swing
Line Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing
Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
Revolving Loans of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount
of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any
Swing Line Loan, (i) the Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate
Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of
any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all
Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment, and provided,
further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to
refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and
subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under
this Section 2.03, prepay under Section 2.04, and reborrow under this Section
2.03. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the
making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby, subject
to the condition set forth in Section 2.03(a)(ii) above, irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk
participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such
Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.

         (b)      Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made
upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than
1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to
be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $500,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof), and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall
be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written
Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any
telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the
Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent
has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender
will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the
contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone
or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any
Lender)
<PAGE>

prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A)
directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of
the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section
2.03(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing
date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line
Loan available to the Borrower at its office by crediting the account of the
Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.

         (c)      Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

                  (i)      The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and
         absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which
         hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on
         its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal
         to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then
         outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written
         request shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan Notice for purposes
         hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02,
         without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the
         principal amount of Base Rate Loans. The Swing Line Lender shall
         furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Revolving Loan
         Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative
         Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of
         the amount specified in such Revolving Loan Notice available to the
         Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of
         the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office not later
         than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Revolving Loan Notice,
         whereupon, subject to Section 2.03(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes
         funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the
         Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds
         so received to the Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
         refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section
         2.03(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line
         Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing
         Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the
         relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant
         to Section 2.03(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such
         participation.

                  (iii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any
         amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section
         2.03(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from
         such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
         amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment
         is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
         to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line
         Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with
         respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (iv)     Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant
         to this Section 2.03(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
         not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off,
         counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may
         have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person
         for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a
         Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing, including whether or not the
         conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall have been satisfied. No such
         funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with
         interest as provided herein.

         (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded
         a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
         receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line
         Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such
         payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to
         reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk
         participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the
         Swing Line Lender.
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in
         respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
         be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances
         described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
         entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender
         shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand
         of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
         such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make
         such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.

         (e)      Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line
Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing
Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation
pursuant to this Section 2.03 to refinance such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any
Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for
the account of the Swing Line Lender.

         (f)      Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall
make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans
directly to the Swing Line Lender.

         2.04     PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at
any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or in
part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received
by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days
prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) one Business
Day prior to any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $3,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal
amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and
amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Revolving Loans to be prepaid. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each
such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan
shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall
be applied to the Revolving Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares.

         (b)      The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily
prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided
that (i) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and
(ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000, or,
if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice
shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by
the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.

         (c)      If for any reason the Outstandings at any time exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay
Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

         2.05     TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower may,
upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or
from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that
(i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction,
(ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000
or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall
not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect
thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Outstandings would
exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any
reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the
amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically
reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the
Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be
applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All
Facility Fees accrued until the Closing Date of any termination of the Aggregate
Commitments shall be paid on the Closing Date of such termination.
<PAGE>

         2.06     REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

         (a)      The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date
the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

         (b)      The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier
to occur of (i) the date seven days after such Loan is made and (ii) the
Maturity Date.

         2.07     INTEREST.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

         (b)      If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document
is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter
bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore,
upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, the
Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding
Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times
equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due
interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

         (c)      Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

         2.08     FEES.

         (a)      Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
facility fee ("Facility Fee") equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual
daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have
terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Loans), regardless of usage. The
Facility Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and
thereafter so long as any Loans remain outstanding), including at any time
during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall
be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on
demand). The Facility Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there
is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount
shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

         (b)      Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger, the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for their own respective accounts fees in
the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be
fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

         2.09     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of the
Facility Fee and interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined
by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of
fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days
elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than
if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan
for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any
portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided
that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject
to Section 2.11(a), bear interest for one day.

2.10     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a)      The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced
by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments
<PAGE>

thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however,
limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any
amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest
error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the
Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative
Agent) a Revolving Loan Note and/or a Swing Line Note, as applicable, which
shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each
Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

         (b)      In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases
and sales by such Lender of participations in Swing Line Loans. In the event of
any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative
Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error.

         2.11     PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

         (a)      All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on
the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of
such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

         (b)      Subject to the provisions of the definition of "Interest
Period", if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other
than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as
the case may be.

         (c)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such
payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make
available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds, then:

                  (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
         portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender
         in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
         respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
         available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such
         amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
         funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                  (ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by
         the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan included
         in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount
         forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the
         Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and
         the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate
         per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable
         Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from
         its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights
         which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any
         Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect
to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.
<PAGE>

         (d)      If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent
funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such
funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without
interest.

         (e)      The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving
Loans and to fund participations in Swing Line Loans are several and not joint.
The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan or to fund any such
participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan or
purchase its participation.

         (f)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         2.12     SHARING OF PAYMENTS. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Revolving Loans made
by it, or the participations in Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated
hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative
Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations
in the Revolving Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the
participations in Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect
of such Revolving Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata
with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the
circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to
that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such
paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without
further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject
to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests,
demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect
to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the
purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01     TAXES.

         (a)      Any and all payments by the Borrower and each other Loan Party
to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes
imposed on or measured by its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on
it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political
subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a lending office (all such
non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), each of the
Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make
<PAGE>

such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such
Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.

         (b)      In addition, the Borrower and each other Loan Party agrees to
pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any
other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any
payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery,
performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any
Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c)      Without duplication of any amounts paid by the Borrower under
Section 3.01(a), if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes or Other
Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

         (d)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii)
amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including
additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
Payment under this subsection (d) shall be made within 30 days after the date
the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

         3.02     ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable,
convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if
such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate
a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such
notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be
materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

         3.03     INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders
determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan,
the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of
the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have
converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans in the amount specified therein.

         3.04     INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY; RESERVES
ON EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

         (a)      If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's
compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans, or a
reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with
any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such
increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes
(as to which
<PAGE>

Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net
income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction
or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such
Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements
contemplated by Section 3.04(c)), then from time to time upon demand of such
Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower
shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such increased cost or reduction.

         (b)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to
time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

         (c)      The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender
shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
"Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves
allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good
faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable
on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower
shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender
fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such
additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such
notice.

         3.05     FUNDING LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount payable to such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such
Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred
by it as a result of:

         (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any
Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration, or otherwise, but excluding any payment or prepayment as
a result of a Lender's failure to make a payment pursuant to Section
2.11(c)(ii));

         (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the
failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert
any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by
the Borrower; or

         (c)      any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than
the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 10.15;

including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits)
arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds
were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees
charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

         3.06     MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

         (a)      A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth in reasonable
detail the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the
Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

         (b)      Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under
Section 3.01 or 3.04, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 10.15.

         3.07     SURVIVAL. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article
III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

<PAGE>

         4.02     CONDITIONS TO ALL CREDIT EXTENSIONS. The obligation of each
Lender to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Revolving Loan
Notice requesting only a conversion of Revolving Loans to the other Type, or a
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans) is subject to the following conditions
precedent:

         (a)      The representations and warranties of the Borrower contained
in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document
furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be
true and correct on and as of the date of such Credit Extension, except to the
extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier
date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date, and
except that for purposes of this Section 4.02, the representations and
warranties contained in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 5.05 shall be
deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a)
through (f), respectively, of Section 6.01.

         (b)      No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed
Credit Extension.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the Swing Line
Lender shall have received a Request for Credit Extension in accordance with the
requirements hereof.

Each Request for Credit Extension (other than a Revolving Loan Notice requesting
only a conversion of Revolving Loans to the other Type or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans) submitted by the Borrower shall be deemed to be a
representation and warranty that the conditions specified in Sections 4.02(a)
and (b) have been satisfied on and as of the date of the applicable Credit
Extension.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
that:

         5.01     EXISTENCE, QUALIFICATION AND POWER; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized or formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority and all
requisite governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to (i)
own its assets and carry on its business and (ii) execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party, (c) is duly
qualified and is licensed and in good standing under the Laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of properties or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, and (d) is in
compliance with all Laws; except in each case referred to in clause (c) or (d),

of any other Person, except where the failure to have any such rights could not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.14     SUBSIDIARIES.

from any Material Subsidiary to the Borrower, other than prohibitions or

Requirements, customary non-assignment provisions in contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices and
Department policies and practices that restrict the ability of Insurance
Subsidiaries to grant Liens on, pledge or transfer assets.

         (b)      Schedule 5.14(b) contains a complete and correct list of all
of the Borrower's Material Subsidiaries (including those UTC's identified as
Material Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.14) as to which the execution and
delivery of the Subsidiary Guaranty is not unlawful.

HOLDING COMPANY ACT. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
or will engage, principally or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying"
"margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as now and
from time to time hereafter in effect. No part of the proceeds of any Credit
Extensions hereunder will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" "margin stock"
as so defined or for any purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent
with, the provisions of Regulations U or X of such Board of Governors. Neither
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (a) is a "holding company", or a

Agent and the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
restrictions to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other
matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No report, financial statement,
certificate or other factual information furnished by or on behalf of the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and the negotiation of this Agreement or
delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
be reasonable at the time.

         5.17     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with the Requirements of
all Laws and all orders, writs, injunctions and decrees applicable to it or to
its properties, except in such instances in which (a) such requirement of Law or
order, writ, injunction or decree is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings diligently conducted or (b) the failure to comply
therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.18     SOLVENT. The Borrower is, and the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are, on a consolidated basis, Solvent.

         5.19     LICENSES. No License, the loss of which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is the subject of a proceeding for
suspension or revocation which is reasonably likely to result in a suspension or
revocation. To the Borrower's knowledge, there is no sustainable basis for such
suspension or revocation of any License, the loss of which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.20     EMPLOYEE MATTERS. There are no strikes, work stoppages,
election or decertification petitions or proceedings, unfair labor charges,
equal employment opportunity proceedings, wage payment or material unemployment
compensation proceedings, material workers' compensation proceedings or other
material labor/employee related controversies pending or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened between the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and any
of their respective employees, other than employee grievances which could not in
the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.21     INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. All of the Annual Statements and
Interim Statements, together with any other financial or similar statements of
the Insurance Subsidiaries provided to the Administrative Agent, are full and
true statements in all material respects of all of the assets and liabilities
and of the condition and affairs of the said Insurance Subsidiaries.

         5.22     TAX SHELTER REGULATIONS. The Borrower does not intend to treat
the Revolving Borrowings and related transactions as being a "reportable
transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In
the event the Borrower determines to take any action inconsistent with such
intention, it will promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof. The
Borrower acknowledges that one or more of the Lenders may treat its Revolving
Loans as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury Regulation Section
301.6112-1, and such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, will maintain the lists
and other records required by such Treasury Regulation.

                         EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

         8.01     EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Any of the following shall constitute an
Event of Default:

         (a)      Non-Payment. The Borrower fails to pay (i) when and as

any other Loan Document; or

         (b)      Specific Covenants. The Borrower or any Subsidiary fails to

such failure or (ii) the date upon which written notice thereof is given to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent or any Lender; or

         (d)      Representations and Warranties. Any representation, warranty,
certification or statement of fact made or deemed made by or on behalf of the

misleading in any material respect when made or deemed made; or

         (e)      Cross-Default. (i) The Borrower or any Subsidiary (A) fails to
make any payment when due (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment,

perform any other agreement or condition relating to any such Indebtedness or
Contingent Obligation or contained in any instrument or agreement evidencing,
securing or relating thereto, or any other event occurs, the effect of which
default or other event is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such
Indebtedness or the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such Guarantee (or a trustee
or agent on behalf of such holder or holders or beneficiary or beneficiaries) to
cause, with the giving of notice if required, such Indebtedness to be demanded
or to become due or to be repurchased, prepaid, defeased or redeemed
(automatically or otherwise), or an offer to repurchase, prepay, defease or
redeem such Indebtedness to be made, prior to its stated maturity, or such
Guarantee to become payable or cash collateral in respect thereof to be
demanded; or (ii) there occurs under any Swap Contract an Early Termination Date
(as defined in such Swap Contract) resulting from (A) any event of default under
such Swap Contract as to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is the Defaulting
Party (as defined in such Swap Contract) or (B) any Termination Event (as so
defined) under such Swap Contract as to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is
an Affected Party (as so defined) and, in either event, the Swap Termination
Value owed by the Borrower or such Subsidiary as a result thereof is greater
than 2% of Net Worth; or

         (f)      Insolvency Proceedings, Etc. The Borrower or any Material
Subsidiary institutes or consents to the institution of any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
applies for or consents to the appointment of any receiver, trustee, custodian,
conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer for it or for all or
any material part of its property; or any receiver, trustee, custodian,
conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer is appointed without
the application or consent of such Person and the appointment continues
undischarged or unstayed for 60 calendar days; or any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law relating to any such Person or to all or any material part of
its property is instituted without the consent of such Person and continues
undismissed or unstayed for 60 calendar days, or an order for relief is entered
in any such proceeding; or any Insurance Subsidiary shall become subject to any
conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation order, directive or mandate issued
by an Governmental Authority; or

         (g)      Inability to Pay Debts; Attachment. (i) The Borrower or any
Material Subsidiary ceases to be Solvent, or becomes unable or admits in writing
its inability or fails generally to pay its debts as they become due, subject to
applicable grace periods, if any, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, or
(ii) any writ or warrant of
<PAGE>

attachment or execution or similar process is issued or levied against all or
any material part of the property of any such Person and is not released,
vacated or fully bonded within 60 days after its issue or levy; or

         (h)      Judgments. There is entered against the Borrower or any
Material Subsidiary (i) a final judgment or order for the payment of money in an
aggregate amount exceeding 2% of Net Worth (to the extent not covered by
independent third-party insurance as to which the insurer does not dispute
coverage), or (ii) any one or more non-monetary final judgments that have, or
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect and, in either case, (A) enforcement proceedings are
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order, or (B) there is a period
of 10 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, by
reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, is not in effect; or

         (i)      ERISA. (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a Pension
Plan or Multiemployer Plan which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to
result in liability of the Borrower under Title IV of ERISA to the Pension Plan,
Multiemployer Plan or the PBGC in an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000;
(ii) the aggregate amount of Unfunded Pension Liability among all Pension Plans
at any time exceeds $5,000,000; or (iii) the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate

of ERISA under a Multiemployer Plan in an aggregate amount in excess of
$5,000,000; or

         (j)      Invalidity of Loan Documents. Any Loan Document, at any time
after its execution and delivery and for any reason other than as expressly
permitted hereunder or satisfaction in full of all the Obligations, ceases to be
in full force and effect; or the Borrower or any other Person contests in any
manner the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document; or the Borrower
denies that it has any or further liability or obligation under any Loan
Document, or purports to revoke, terminate or rescind any Loan Document; or

         (k)      Change of Control. There occurs any Change of Control; or

         (l)      Loss of Licenses. Any Governmental Authority revokes, fails to
renew or suspends any License of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, which
revocation, failure or suspension has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, or the Borrower or any Subsidiary for any reason
loses any License which loss has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or the Borrower or any Subsidiary suffers the
imposition of any restraining order, escrow, suspension or impound of funds in
connection with any proceeding (judicial or administrative) with respect to any
License which imposition has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; or

         (m)      Environmental Damages. A reasonable basis shall exist for the
assertion against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor in
interest of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of (or there shall have been
asserted against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) any claims or
liabilities, whether accrued, absolute or contingent, based on or arising from
the generation, storage, transport, handling or disposal of Hazardous Materials
by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or predecessors thereof that, in the
judgment of the Required Lenders, are reasonably likely to be determined
adversely to the Borrower or such Subsidiary and the amount payable as a result
thereof has a Material Adverse Effect (after deducting such amounts that are
reasonably expected to be paid by other creditworthy Persons jointly and
severally liable therefor); or

         (n)      Governmental Action. The Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required by any applicable bank regulatory authority, any applicable
insurance regulatory authority or other Governmental Authority to enter into,
after the date hereof, any indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement
(including any capital maintenance agreement) that directly or indirectly,
prohibits or restrains, or has the effect of prohibiting or restraining, or
imposes material adverse conditions upon the incurrence or payment of
Indebtedness, the granting of Liens, the declaration or payment of dividends,
the making of Investments or the Disposition of property or requires the making
of capital contributions to, or other Investments in, any such Subsidiary in an
aggregate amount which has a Material Adverse Effect.

         8.02     REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may,
with the consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following
actions:

         (a)      declare the commitment of each Lender to make Loans to be
terminated, whereupon such commitments shall be terminated;

         (b)      declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans,
all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately
<PAGE>

due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; and

         (c)      exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and
remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or applicable
Law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under
Section 8.01(f), the obligation of each Lender to make Loans shall automatically
terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest
and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable,
without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         8.03     APPLICATION OF FUNDS. After the exercise of remedies provided
for in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately
due and payable as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts
received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent in the following order:

First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents in its capacity as such;

Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the
Lenders (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III) under
the Loan Documents, ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in
this clause Second payable to them;

Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and
unpaid interest on the Loans, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the
respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;

Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid
principal of the Loans, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the
respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them;

Fifth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations in respect of Swap
Contracts, ratably among the Guarantied Parties, in proportion to the respective
amounts described in this clause Fifth held by them; and

Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly
paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

                                   ARTICLE IX.
                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         9.01     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each
Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement
and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in
any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with
any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

         9.02     DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         9.03     LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. No Agent-Related Person
shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be
responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by the Borrower or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred
<PAGE>

to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other party
to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any
Affiliate thereof.

         9.04     RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a)      The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the
Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders
as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater
number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all the Lenders.

         (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
specifying its objection thereto.

         9.05     NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with
respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to
be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default." The Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent
shall take such action with respect to such Default as may be directed by the
Required Lenders in accordance with Article VIII; provided, however, that unless
and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

         9.06     CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed
to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the
Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
<PAGE>

required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any
of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into
the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

         9.07     INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on
behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party
to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however,
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of
any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations
and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         9.08     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Bank of
America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the
account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other
business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though
Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the Swing Line Lender
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent
shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect
to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though
it were not the Administrative Agent or the Swing Line Lender, and the terms
"Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

         9.09     SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders; provided
that any such resignation by Bank of America shall also constitute its
resignation as Swing Line Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this
Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor
administrative agent for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall
be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of
an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to
the Closing Date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the
Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and Swing Line
Lender and the respective terms "Administrative Agent" and "Swing Line Lender"
shall mean such successor administrative agent and swing line lender, and the
retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated and the retiring Swing Line Lender's rights, powers
and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed
on the part of such retiring Swing Line Lender or any other Lender. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent
has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days
following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

         9.10     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

         (a)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other
Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.08 and 10.04) allowed in such
judicial proceeding; and

         (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.08 and 10.04.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

         9.11     GUARANTY MATTERS. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any
Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty if such
Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted
hereunder. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release
any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty
pursuant to this Section 9.11.

         9.12     OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS. None of the Lenders or
other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement
as a "syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-agent," "book manager,"
"lead manager," "managing agent," "co-managing agent", "arranger," "lead
arranger" or "co-arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of such
Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the
foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be
deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or
other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking action hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.01    AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by
the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the
Required Lenders and the Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent,
and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such
amendment, waiver or consent shall:

         (a)      waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01(a) without the
written consent of each Lender;

         (b)      extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate
any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 2.05 or Section 8.02) without the
written consent of such Lender;
<PAGE>

         (c)      postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document for any payment or mandatory prepayment of principal, interest, fees or
other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other
Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby;

         (d)      reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
herein on, any Loan, or (subject to clause (iii)) of the second proviso to this
Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other
Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall
be necessary to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the
Default Rate;

         (e)      change Section 2.12 or Section 8.03 or the definition of "Pro
Rata Share" in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;

         (f)      change any provision of this Section or the definition of
"Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender; or

         (g)      release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors
from the Subsidiary Guaranty without the written consent of each Lender
(provided no consent of any Lender shall be required in the event of a release
of the Subsidiary Guaranty as a result of a Guaranty Release Event);

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required
above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this
Agreement; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document; and (iii) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or
privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder,
except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended
without the consent of such Lender.

         10.02    NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS; FACSIMILE COPIES.

         (a)      General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including by facsimile transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed,
faxed or delivered to the applicable address, facsimile number or (subject to
subsection (c) below) electronic mail address, and all notices and other
communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be
made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

                  (i)      if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the
         Swing Line Lender, to the address, facsimile number, electronic mail
         address or telephone number specified for such Person on Schedule 10.02
         or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or
         telephone number as shall be designated by such party in a notice to
         the other parties; and

                  (ii)     if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
         Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
         designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender.

All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made
upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and
(ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of
the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after
deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic
mail (which form of delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c)
below), when delivered; provided, however, that notices and other communications
to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Article II
shall not be effective until actually received by such Person. In no event shall
a voicemail message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation
hereunder.

         (b)      Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
may also require that any such documents and
<PAGE>

signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided,
however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the
effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

         (c)      Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet
and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications,
such as financial statements and other information as provided in Section 6.02,
and to distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may
not be used for any other purpose.

         (d)      Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any
notices (including telephonic Revolving Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan
Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such
notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not
preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the
terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation
thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender
from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower.
All telephonic notices to and other communications with the Administrative Agent
may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto
hereby consents to such recording.

         10.03    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.

         10.04    ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. The Borrower agrees (a) to
pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Arranger in connection
with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or other
modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including all Attorney Costs, and (b) to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or
preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout"
or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding,
including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney
Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search, filing,
recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related
thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
and the cost of independent public accountants and other outside experts
reasonably retained by the Administrative Agent or, with respect to clause (b)
above, any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 10.04 shall be payable
within ten Business Days after demand therefor, setting forth in reasonable
detail the costs and expenses so incurred. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other
Obligations.

         10.05    INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BORROWER. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs)
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out
of or in connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance
or administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or
instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment or
Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, or (c) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, settlement of, or defense of any pending
or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
<PAGE>

judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are (i) determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (ii) are
the result of claims asserted against an Indemnitee by another Indemnitee. No
Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any
information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, nor shall
any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its
activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the
Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be payable within
ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any
Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

         10.06    PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid
by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate from time to time in effect.

         10.07    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this
Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject
to the restrictions of subsection (f) or (h) of this Section (and any other
attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d)
of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

         (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
purposes of this subsection (b), participations in Swing Line Loans) at the time
owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at
the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this Section)
with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment,
determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is
specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be
less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents
(each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each
partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all
the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect
to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not
apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans; (iii) any assignment of a
Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line
Lender (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless
the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the
proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); (iv) the
parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
an Assignment and Assumption; and (v) the assignor Lender or Eligible Assignee
shall have paid the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording
<PAGE>

thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section,
from and after the Closing Date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the
Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the Closing Date of such assignment). Upon request, the
Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee
Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under
this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

         (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations Swing
Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01
that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender.

         (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
10.15 as though it were a Lender.

         (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         (g)      As used herein, the following terms have the following
meanings:

         "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender;
         (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural
         person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line
         Lender, and (ii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, the Borrower (each such
<PAGE>

         approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that
         notwithstanding the foregoing,

         "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Borrower or any of the
         Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

         "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will
         be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in
         commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary
         course of its business.

         "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a
         Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate
         of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

         (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for
such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even
though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

         (i)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to
subsection (b) above, Bank of America shall, upon 30 days' notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such
resignation as Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from
among the Lenders a successor Swing Line Lender hereunder but no Lender shall be
required to accept such appointment; provided, however, that no failure by the
Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of
America as Swing Line Lender. If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender,
it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder
with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the Closing
Date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make
Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans
pursuant to Section 2.03(c).

         10.08    CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and will
agree to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party
to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of
or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such
contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor)
to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Borrower;
(g) with the consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent such Information (i)
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or
(ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower without breach of
any duty of confidentiality known to the Administrative Agent or such Lender; or
(i) to the NAIC or any other similar organization. In addition, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this
Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors,
similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and
management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the
Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all
information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality
of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, "Information" shall not include, and the Administrative Agent and each
Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect
to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation
<PAGE>

Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of
any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in
either case contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure
of the transaction as well as other information, this sentence shall only apply
to such portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax
treatment or tax structure of the Loans and transactions contemplated hereby.

         10.09    SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being
waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Loan
Party) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, but not any
deposits held in a custodial, trust or other fiduciary capacity) at any time
held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all
Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now
or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent
or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or
denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or
indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

         10.10    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         10.11    INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

         10.12    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

         10.13    SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

         10.14    TAX FORMS.

         (a)

                  (i)      Each Lender that is not a "United States person"
         within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign
         Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of
         any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an
         assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of
         either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such
         Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of,
         withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by
         the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any
         successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign
         Lender by the
<PAGE>

         Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence
         satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such
         Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
         withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of
         the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender
         shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional
         duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such
         successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant
         United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then
         current United States Laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence
         as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any
         available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding
         taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by
         the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the
         Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify
         or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such
         steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the
         reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary
         (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any
         requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
         withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

                  (ii)     Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
         ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
         sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents
         (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender),
         shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign
         Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of
         any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be
         necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the
         reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed
         copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such
         Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums
         paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own
         account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly
         signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto),
         together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such
         form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required
         under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own
         account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such
         Lender.

                  (iii)    The Borrower shall not be required to pay any
         additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with
         respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis
         of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender
         transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 10.14(a) or
         (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 10.14(a); provided that if such Lender shall
         have satisfied the requirement of this Section 10.14(a) on the date
         such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with
         respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this
         Section 10.14(a) shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay
         any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result of
         any change in any applicable Law, treaty or governmental rule,
         regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
         administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
         properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
         subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person
         for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under
         any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject
         to withholding at a reduced rate.

                  (iv)     The Administrative Agent may, without reduction,
         withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any
         payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the
         Borrower is not required to pay additional amounts under this Section
         10.14(a).

         (b)      Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that
is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies
of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

         (c)      If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax
or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this
<PAGE>

Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of
all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         10.15    REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. Under any circumstances set forth
herein providing that the Borrower shall have the right to replace a Lender as a
party to this Agreement, the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its
Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance)
pursuant to Section 10.07(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible Assignees
procured by the Borrower; provided, however, that if the Borrower elects to
exercise such right with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section 3.06(b), it
shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made similar requests for
compensation pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04. The Borrower shall (x) pay in
full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Lender
through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.05), (y) provide appropriate assurances and indemnities (which may
include letters of credit) to the Swing Line Lender as each may reasonably
require with respect to any continuing obligation to fund participation
interests in any Swing Line Loans then outstanding, and (z) release such Lender
from its obligations under the Loan Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall
execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender's
Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in Swing Line Loans.
