                         SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

         Note to Prospective Offerors: Attachment L, Offeror's Checklist, has
         been added to this RFP as a convenience to offerors. It is believed to
         be a complete list of all submission requirements pursuant to this RFP.
         However, if a requirement is stated anywhere in the RFP text yet does
         not appear in the Offeror's Checklist, the text statement takes
         precedence over the omission of that requirement in the Offeror's
         Checklist.

1.       SCOPE OF SERVICES

before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility coverage, the
Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage during the time the
member is enrolled with the Contractor.

NUTRITION: The Contractor shall provide nutritional assessment and nutritional
supplements including oral supplements for EPSDT members when medically
necessary. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is covered for all members when it

services include bone marrow, heart, lung, heart-lung, kidney, liver and cornea
transplantations (all with related immunosuppressant medications), and are
covered within limitations defined in the AMPM, Chapter 300 for members
diagnosed with specified medical conditions. Such limitations include whether
the stage of the disease is such that the transplant can affect the outcome; the

         the PCP, family members, self-referrals, schools, other service
         providers, and members of the community and State agencies as well as
         the Contractor's staff. The same referral procedures which are
         applicable to other health care services apply to behavioral health
         services.

         SERVICE PLAN: The Contractor is responsible for developing a Service
         Plan for each categorically eligible member age 18, 19 and 20 requiring

         be included as part of the member's medical record.

         CASE MANAGEMENT, CASE COORDINATION: The Contractor is responsible for
         providing case management services, when medically necessary. Case
         management services may vary in scope and frequency, depending on the
         eligible person's intensity of need. Case management services consist
         of a set of services and activities through which appropriate and
         cost-effective Title XIX covered services are identified, planned,
         coordinated, obtained, monitored and continuously evaluated. Case
         coordination is provided to categorically eligible members age 18, 19
         and 20 who are in need of behavioral health services but who do not
         require case management services which are more intensive. Case
         coordination is limited to Service Plan development, identification of
         service providers, monitoring, updates and follow-up, when necessary.

         behavioral health providers who meet ADHS licensure and/or
         certification standards and who are registered as a behavioral health
         provider with AHCCCSA. The Contractor may, at its option, contract with
         ADHS RBHAs for the provision of behavioral health services. The
         Contractor must ensure that a sufficient number of qualified behavioral
         health providers are in their provider network and that providers
         comply with subcontracting, appointment standards and other provider
         related requirements in this document.


                                      D-8
<PAGE>

         NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor is responsible for notifying
         AHCCCSA monthly of 18-19-and 20-year-old categorical. non-SMI members
         referred and receiving behavioral health services. The information is
         to be submitted to the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care using the
         reporting format developed by AHCCCSA and available in the Bidder's
         Library.

this contract. AHCCCSA will provide three copies of the AMPM to the Contractor
(for use by the CEO, Medical Director and Quality Management staff). Updates to
medical policies will be distributed quarterly. The Contractor is responsible
for maintaining the AMPM with these updates and for complying with the
requirements set forth therein.


4.       VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of the Social
Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program which became
effective 10/1/94. Through this program the federal government purchases, and
makes available to the states free of charge, vaccines for children under age 19
who are Title XIX eligible (or Native American) and not insured, or whose
insurance does not cover immunizations. Any provider licensed by the State to
administer immunizations may register with ADHS as a "VFC provider" and receive
free vaccines. State money to purchase vaccines is not available since the
program is 100% funded by the federal government. The Contractor shall comply
with all VFC requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if providing
immunizations to AHCCCS EPSDT members, the providers are registered with
ADHS/VFC.


5.       DENIALS OR REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES

Contractor shall comply with the notice and continuation of benefits
requirements specified in 42 CFR 431.200 et seq. and further prescribed in Perry
V. Chen, now referred to as Perry v. Kelly.

6.       ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll members. The
Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any reason unless directed to do
so by AHCCCSA. Eligibility for the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined
by one of the following agencies:

                                            Beneficiary program.

Arizona's 15 Counties                       Each county determines eligibility
                                            for the Medically Needy/Medically
                                            Indigent (MN/MI), Eligible Low
                                            Income Children (ELIC), and the
                                            State Emergency Services state
                                            programs.

AHCCCS acute care eligible members are enrolled with contractors in accordance
with the rules set forth in R9-23-333, R9-22-334, R9-22-335, R9-22-337,
R9-22-339, R9-22-340, R9-22-342 and R9-22-707.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

All members except for those eligible under the MN/MI program have a choice of
available health plans. AHCCCSA anticipates that a listing of the available
health plans and their telephone numbers will be given to each member applicant
during the application process for AHCCCS benefits. Also included are
instructions to member applicants to call the health plans directly with
specific questions concerning the health plan. If there is only one health plan
available for the member applicant's Geographical Service Area, no choice is
offered. Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA's being notified of their
eligibility are anticipated to be


                                      D-10
<PAGE>

automatically assigned to a health plan based on family continuity or the
auto-assignment algorithm.

AHCCCSA assigns MN/MI eligible members to an available health plan based on
family continuity or through AHCCCSA's auto-assignment algorithm. These members
do not get a choice of available contractors until the annual open enrollment
period.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies include: Previously eligible and
enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90 days will be
automatically enrolled with the same contractor if that contractor is still
available. Also, women whose SOBRA eligibility has terminated and have become
enrolled in the Family Planning Services Extension Program will automatically
remain assigned to the same health plan. The Family Planning Services Extension
Program provides a maximum of 24 months of family planning services.

The effective date of enrollment of a new member with the Contractor will
generally be the day prior to the date the Contractor receives notification from
AHCCCSA via the daily roster. However, the Contractor is responsible for payment
of medically necessary covered services retroactive to the member's beginning
date of eligibility.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for categorical and
non-categorical members. For categorical members, prior period coverage starts
from the first day of the month of application, or first eligible month. The
Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary
covered services provided to categorical members during prior period coverage.
For non-categorical members (MN/MI, ELIC) prior period coverage is generally
limited to the two days prior to the date of AHCCCSA being notified of
eligibility. However, prior period coverage could include additional days prior
to the date of enrollment. The Contractor is responsible for payment of all
claims for medically necessary covered services provided on an emergency basis
to non-categorical members pursuant to ARS ss. 36-2908 for the first two days of
the prior period coverage. Any additional prior period coverage for
non-categorical members will include all claims for medically necessary covered
services. This may include services provided prior to 10/1/97. (See Section D,
Paragraph 37, Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement
from AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers who were enrolled at the time
of the child's birth and whose newborn notification was received by AHCCCSA will
be enrolled with the mother's contractor. The Contractor is responsible for
notifying AHCCCSA of a child's birth to an enrolled member and, for capitation
purposes, the effective date of the newborn's enrollment is the date AHCCCSA
receives such notification. Note that AHCCCSA is currently available to receive
these calls Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. The effective date of
enrollment will be the date notification is received and capitation will begin
on that date. Categorically eligible mothers or newborns are sent a letter
advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for their child;
otherwise the child will remain with the mother's contractor. The Contractor is
responsible for all covered services to the newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has
received notification of the child's birth. Newborns of MN/MI mothers are
enrolled with the mother's contractor for a minimum of 30 days up to a maximum
of 60 days.


                                      D-11
<PAGE>

AHCCCS Rules R9-22-342 and R9-22-707 contain additional information concerning
newborn enrollment and payment.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a categorically
eligible member, or as an Eligible Assistance Child (EAC), the member is
guaranteed a minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Enrollment
guarantees do not apply to Native Americans who choose to obtain their covered
services through Indian Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service basis. The
enrollment guarantee applies a maximum of one time per member as a categorical
member and one time as an EAC member. If a member changes from one contractor to
another within the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of the guarantee
period applies to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may not be
granted or may be terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor child,
is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22-337 describes other reasons for which the
enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans eligible under any coverage group other than
MN/MI, on or off-reservation, have a choice of Indian Health Services (IHS) or
any available contractor. If choice is not made within the specified time limit,
Native American members living on-reservation will be assigned to IHS and Native
American members living off-reservation will be assigned to an available
contractor using AHCCCSA's family continuity policy and auto-assignment
algorithm. Native American members eligible under the MN/MI coverage group
living on-reservation will be assigned to Indian Health Services (IHS) and those
living off-reservation will be assigned to a contractor using regular MN/MI
enrollment policy. Native Americans may change from IHS to a contractor or from
a contractor to IHS at any time.


7.       MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, or physical or mental handicap, except where
medically indicated. Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not
limited to, the following:

a.       Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
         available facility.
b.       Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
         provided in a different manner or at a different time from that
         provided to other members, other public or private patients or the
         public at large except where medically necessary.
c.       Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
         related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in
         any way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed
         by others receiving any covered service.
d.       The assignment of tunes or places for the provision of services on the
         basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
         ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
         membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
         served.


                                      D-12
<PAGE>

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e., the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

8.       MEMBER INFORMATION

All informational materials prepared by the Contractor shall be approved by
AHCCCSA prior to distribution to members. Information shall be submitted on
disk, saved as a text file (.txt) along with a hard copy printout. Information
shall be provided in English and a second language when 200 members or 5% of the
Contractor's enrolled population, whichever is greater, are non-English
speaking. (AHCCCSA will advise the Contractor when and if this requirement
applies.) When there are program or service site changes notification will be
provided to the affected members at least 14 days before implementation. The
Contractor shall review and update the Member Handbook at least once a year. The
Handbook must be submitted to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care for approval by
Sept. 1 of each contract year, or within four weeks of receiving the annual
renewal amendment, whichever is later.

The Contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all information prepared
for distribution to members is written at a 4th grade level.

The Contractor shall produce and provide the following printed information to
each member or family within 10 days of receipt of notification of the
enrollment date:

         applicable copayments) and under what circumstances a member may be
         billed for non-covered services.

         include a statement that the member is responsible for protecting his
         or her ID card and that misuse of the card, including loaning, selling

<PAGE>

Q.       What if I'm not happy with the help given to me by the Member
         Representative?
A.       If you are unhappy with the answer you receive, you can tell the Member
         Representative you want to file a written or oral grievance. The
         grievance must be filed not later than 35 days after the date of the
         action, decision, or incident.
A.       [Contractor's name] will make a final decision for grievances within 30
         days of receiving your written or oral grievance. A letter will be
         mailed to you stating the health plan's decision and the reason for the
         decision. The letter will tell you how you can appeal the decision if
         you are still unhappy. You must let the health plan know you want to
         appeal the decision letter.
A.       If you are appealing the health plan's decision, [Contractor's name]
         will send your request for appeal to the AHCCCSA. You will receive
         information from AHCCCSA on how your appeal will be handled. AHCCCSA
         will then decide if the health plan's decision was correct under the
         circumstances.

II.       A list of the names, telephone numbers and service site addresses of
PCPs available for selection by the member and a description of the selection
process.


9.       MEMBER SURVEYS

AHCCCSA may periodically conduct a survey of a representative sample of the
Contractor's membership. AHCCCSA will design a questionnaire to assess
accessibility, availability and continuity of care with PCPs, communication
between members and the Contractor, and general member satisfaction with the
AHCCCS program. To ensure comparability of results, the questions to the members
will be the same for all contractors. AHCCCSA will consider suggestions from the
Contractor for questions to be included in this survey. The results of these
surveys will become public information and available to all interested parties
upon request. In addition, the Contractor shall perform its own annual general
or focused member survey. All such contractor surveys must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA.


10.      MARKETING PLANS

The Contractor shall submit all proposed marketing plans and materials to
AHCCCSA for prior approval in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plan Marketing
Policy, a copy of which is available in the Bidder's Library. The Contractor
must have signed contracts with hospitals (in Maricopa and Pima counties), PCPs,
specialists and pharmacies in order for them to be included in marketing
materials.


11.      OPEN ENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA conducts an open enrollment for members once per contract year, usually
in August or September. AHCCCSA may hold additional open enrollments on a
limited basis as deemed necessary. During open enrollment members may change
contractors subject to the availability of other contractors within their area.
Members are mailed a printed enrollment form and may


                                      D-15
<PAGE>

choose a new contractor by contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment
process. If the member does not participate in open enrollment, no change of
contractor will be made (except for approved changes under the Change of Plan
policy) for the new contract year provided the Contractor's contract is renewed
and the member continues to live in the Contractor's service area. The
Contractor shall comply with the Office of Managed Care Member Transition for
Open Enrollment policy.


12.      TRANSITION OF MEMBERS

The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM standards for member transitions
between health plans or GSA's, to or from an ALTCS program contractor, and upon
termination or expiration of a contract. The Contractor shall develop and
implement policies and procedures which comply with AHCCCS medical policy to
address transition of:

1.       Members with significant medical conditions such as a high-risk
         pregnancy or pregnancy within the last 30 days, the need for organ or
         tissue transplantation, chronic illness resulting in hospitalization or
         nursing facility placement, etc.;
2.       Members who are receiving ongoing services such as behavioral health,
         dialysis, home health, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who are

         the transitioning member by the relinquishing contractor; and
5.       Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost of reproducing
         and forwarding medical records shall be the responsibility of the
         relinquishing contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification of the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible to coordinate care with
the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and for
providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions of how to obtain services. The Contractor shall comply
with the AHCCCS Behavioral Health Policy Manual for transition of members in
need of behavioral health services to be provided through the ADHS RBHA system.

In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is terminated for any reason,
or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the transition of its members
to other contractors, and shall abide by standards and protocols set forth
above. In addition, AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the
contract on a month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of members. The
Contractor shall make provision for continuing all management and administrative
services until the transition of all members is completed and all other
requirements of this contract are satisfied. The Contractor shall be responsible
for providing all reports set forth in this contract and necessary for the
transition process and shall be responsible for the following:

            IBNR amounts;
         2) A monthly summary of cash disbursements;
         3) Copies of all bank statements received by the Contractor.
         Such reports shall be due on the fifth day of each succeeding month for
         the prior month.
d.       In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCSA,
         such termination or suspension shall not affect the obligation of the
         Contractor to indemnity AHCCCSA for any claim by any third party
         against the State or AHCCCSA arising from the Contractor's performance
         of this contract and for which the Contractor would otherwise be liable
         under this contract.
e.       Any dispute by the Contractor with respect to termination or suspension
         of this contract by AHCCCSA shall be exclusively governed by the
         provisions of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: The AHCCCS goal for quality of care is to meet or exceed
the Healthy People Year 2000 national goals. For CYE 98, the Contractor shall
comply with AHCCCS quality management requirements to improve performance of at
least the following established performance indicators: low birth weight;
mammography screening; and cervical cancer screening.

If the Contractor has not achieved at least the statewide average for each

statewide average for EPSDT dental services, but lower than 50%, AHCCCSA may
require the Contractor to submit a corrective action plan within specified time
lines.

17.   QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT (QM/UM)

The Contractor shall provide to members quality medical care as described in the
AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual, Chapter 900, regardless of payer source or

The Contractor is required to disclose all physician incentive agreements to
AHCCCSA and to AHCCCS members who request them.

The Contractor shall not enter into contractual arrangements that place
providers at significant financial risk as defined in CFR 417.479 unless
specifically approved in advance by the Office of Managed Care. AHCCCSA has
accumulated all available information from HCFA regarding physician incentives
in a binder marked "Physician Incentive Guidelines" in the Bidder's Library. Due
to recent verbal communication with HCFA representatives regarding physician
incentives, AHCCCSA is postponing its development of the "AHCCCS Physician
Incentive Guidelines"; therefore, offerors are instructed to use the information

the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as allopathic or osteopathic
physicians who generally specialize in family practice, internal medicine,
obstetrics or pediatrics; certified nurse practitioners or certified nurse
midwifes; or physician's assistants.

At a minimum, the Contractor's number of full-time equivalent PCPs to enrolled
members shall not exceed a ratio of 1:1800 for adults and 1:1200 for children
who are 12 or younger. If the PCP contracts with more than one AHCCCS health
plan, the ratio shall be adjusted by the Contractor to ensure the total number
of AHCCCS members does not exceed the above ratio. The


                                      D-24
<PAGE>


Contractor should consider the PCP's total patient panel size (i.e., AHCCCS and
non-AHCCCS patients) when assessing the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS'
appointment and other standards. In addition, AHCCCS members shall not comprise
the majority of the PCP's panel of patients. The Contractor shall also reduce
the number of members assigned to its network PCPs as necessary to meet the
appointment standards specified in Section D, Paragraph 19, Appointment
Standards. Any variation to the above standards must be submitted to AHCCCSA
Office of the Medical Director for prior approval. PCPs with assigned members
diagnosed with AIDS or as HIV-positive shall meet criteria and standards set
forth in AHCCCS Medical Policy and AHCCCS AIDS Advisory Committee Guidelines.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data regarding
PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign members with
complex medical conditions who are age 12 and younger to Board-certified
pediatricians.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice in selecting a PCP. When a new member has been assigned to the
Contractor, the Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment
and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's receipt of
notification of assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include with the
enrollment notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs and the
process for changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so. The
Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to the member. Members may
make both their initial PCP selection and any subsequent PCP changes either
verbally or in writing.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a.    Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member

b.    Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care

c.    Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member

d.    Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
      services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
      referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director. PCPs and specialists who provide
inpatient services to the Contractor's members shall have admitting and
treatment privileges in a minimum of one general acute care hospital that is
located within the Contractor's service area.


23. OTHER PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to:


                                      D-25
<PAGE>


a.    Recruit sufficient specialty physicians, dentists, health care
      professionals, health care institutions and support services to meet the
      medical needs of its members.

b.    Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
      network to meet the needs of its members.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCS, Office of the
Medical Director and shall be monitored through operational audits at least
annually.

For specialty services, the Contractor shall ensure that:

a.    PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services.

b.    Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a medical
      condition other than that for which the member was referred, unless
      approved by the member's PCP.

c.    The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP complete
      documentation of all diagnostic services including copies of test results
      if applicable, treatment services provided and the resulting outcome for
      each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.    Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are general
      practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics

b.    Certified nurse midwives

c.    Licensed midwives.

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric care (physician
or certified nurse midwife). Such assignment shall be consistent with the
freedom of choice requirements for selecting health care professionals while
ensuring that the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a
PCP for medical care as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges. Licensed midwives perform deliveries only in the member's
home. Labor and delivery services may also be provided in the member's home by
physicians and certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.


24.   NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient professional and
paramedical personnel for the provision of covered services,




                                      D-26
<PAGE>


including emergency medical care on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The
proposed network shall be sufficient to provide covered services within
designated time and distance limits.

25.   NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertain to all
service specifications described in the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual, Chapters
300, 600 and 900. In addition, the Contractor shall have policies on how the
Contractor will:

a.    Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program changes
      and requirements

b.    Monitor and control network compliance with policies and rules of AHCCCSA
      and the Contractor

c.    Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network

d.    Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
      network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service area

e.    Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient providers to
      handle the volume of members

f.    Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring appointment procedures
      standards, appointment waiting times, and service provision standards

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this solicitation.
The Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned material changes in the
provider network before the change process has begun for example before issuing
a 60-day termination notice to a provider. The notification shall be made within
one working day if the change is unexpected. AHCCCSA will assess proposed
changes in the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members'
health care and provide a written response to the Contractor within 14 days of
receipt of request. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care if the provider network change is likely to result in
deficient delivery of covered services.

26.   FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the federal mandates in OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. This
legislation gives FQHCs the option to require state Medicaid programs to
reimburse the FQHC at 100% of reasonable costs



                                      D-27
<PAGE>

for the services delivered. AHCCCSA and its contractors are required to comply
with this legislation.

At the time of contracting, the Contractor must offer the FQHC the option to
elect reasonable cost reimbursement for categorically eligible members. This
provision should be within the contract between the FQHC and the Contractor. If
the FQHC does not elect reasonable cost reimbursement, the FQHC waives the
opportunity to receive reasonable cost reimbursement for that contract period.
No retroactive elections shall be permitted.

If the FQHC elects reasonable cost reimbursement, the Contractor must notify the
AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care within seven days of the subcontract signing. If
the FQHC elects reasonable cost reimbursement, the Contractor may, at its
discretion, pay reasonable cost reimbursement, or pay using some other method of
payment, such as capitation, since the requirement to pay reasonable costs
applies to the State Medicaid Agency, not to the Contractor.

For example, the Contractor contracts with an FQHC that elects reasonable cost
reimbursement. The method of payment throughout the contract period could be
capitation. Throughout the year, the Contractor would be required to file a
quarterly cost report with AHCCCS. (The instructions for the health plan
quarterly reports can be obtained from the Office of Managed Care.) At the end
of the year, the FQHC must complete certain reporting requirements outlined in
the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Reasonable Cost Reimbursement
Cost Report & Instructions. These two reporting packages will enable AHCCCSA to
determine reasonable costs, in comparison to actual capitation paid by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA would reimburse the FQHC if the capitation payments were
less than reasonable costs. Likewise, AHCCCSA would recoup payments in excess of
reasonable costs.

In determining the reasonableness of the capitation payments made by the
Contractor to the FQHC, AHCCCSA will value the per member per month capitation
payment at a rate which approximates the average rate being paid by the
Contractor in the community to other similar providers. If there are no other
providers from which to develop an average rate, other means will be used to
determine the average for the area. If the actual capitation rate paid by the
Contractor to the FQHC is less than the average rate being paid by the
Contractor to other providers, the Contractor must reimburse the FQHC for this
difference. AHCCCSA would reimburse the difference between reasonable cost and
the average capitation rate.

The Contractor shall adhere to the AHCCCS Federally Qualified Health Centers
Cost Resort Instructions-General Instructions which describes the reporting
requirements applicable to the Contractor's contracting with a FQHC that elects
cost reimbursement. A copy of these requirements is available in the Bidder's
Library. Included among the FQHCs currently recognized by HCFA are the
following:

         Clinica Adelante
         West Pinal Family Health Center
         Valley Health Center
         United Community Health Center
         Mariposa Community Health Center


                                      D-28
<PAGE>

         Lake Powell Medical Center
         Mountain Park Health Center
         El Rio Santa Cruz Neighborhood Health Center
         Native American Health Care Center
         Traditional Indian Alliance
         Native Americans for Community Action, Inc.

27.   PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that each of its subcontractors register with
AHCCCSA as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID
Number. A Provider Participation Agreement must be signed with each provider who
does not already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be
forwarded to AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in
order for the Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled
members and for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

28.   PROVIDER AFFILIATION TAPE

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Tape User Manual on October 15, January 15, April 15, and
July 15 of each contract year. The Manual may be found in the Bidder's Library.


29.   PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its HCFA grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:


a.    Timeliness: Reports or other required data shall be received on or before
      scheduled due dates.

b.    Accuracy: Reports or other required data shall be prepared in strict
      conformity with appropriate authoritative sources and/or AHCCCS defined
      standards.

c.    Completeness: All required information shall be fully disclosed in a
      manner that is both responsive and pertinent to report intent with no
      material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.


                                      D-29
<PAGE>


The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

30.   DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA, or the federal government, to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials which are produced by the Contractor and
refer to covered services shall state that such services are funded under
contract with AHCCCSA.


31.   REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.


32.   OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business for the contract year beginning 10/1/97. The
purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess new contractors' readiness and ability
to provide contract services to members at the start of the contract year. A new
contractor will be permitted to commence operations only if the Readiness Review
factors are met to AHCCCSA's satisfaction.


33.   OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with HCFA requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular Operational
and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not limited to) ensuring
operational and financial program compliance. The Reviews will identify areas
where improvements can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and provide the
Contractor with technical assistance if necessary. The


                                      D-30


<PAGE>


Contractor shall comply with all other medical audit provisions as required by
AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful. AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel as identified in advance shall be
available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
work space, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA or
any other nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the
entire NCQA report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and Financial Review
Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior to
AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review findings
may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements must be implemented by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to
determine the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations and
achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be conducted at any time
after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

34.   CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost-avoiding and paying claims in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-705, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. In the absence
of a subcontract provision to the contrary, claims submission deadlines shall be
calculated from the date of service or the elective date of enrollment,
whichever is later. Remittance advices accompanying the Contractor's payments to
providers must contain, at a minimum, adequate descriptions of all denials and
adjustments, the reasons for such denials and adjustments, the amount billed,
the amount paid, and grievance rights. The Contractor's claims payment system,
as well as its prior authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize
the likelihood of having to recoup already-paid claims. Any


                                      D-31


<PAGE>

recoupment in excess of $50,000 per provider within a contract year must be
approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

During the term of this contract, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring all health plans
to use a standardized electronic format for electronic claims processing between
the plan and its providers. AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the
Technical Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by FFS providers and their billing agents who submit claims
electronically to AHCCCS. The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts will be supplemented
by a Form C layout. All formats are subject to changes initiated by the
Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation. Reasonable implementation timeframes will be
negotiated with each plan.

35.   HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT

MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES ONLY: The Arizona Laws of 1996 Chapter 288 Section 20
sets forth the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective
from October 1, 1997, through September 30, 2000. The Pilot as defined by AHCCCS
Rule R9-22-7l8 requires hospital subcontracts to be negotiated between health
plans in Maricopa and Pima counties and hospitals to establish reimbursement
levels, terms and conditions. Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor
and hospitals to cover operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims
submission and payment, payment of discounts or penalties, legal resolution,
which may. as an option, include establishing arbitration procedures. These
negotiated subcontracts shall remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to insure
availability of quality services within specific service districts, equity of
related party interests, reasonableness of rates, and only marketing of
contracted organizations. The general provisions of this program encompass acute
care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that result in an
admission. The Contractor shall submit all hospital subcontracts and any
amendments to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care, for prior approval. For
non-emergency patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that at least 35% of its
members use contracted hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently
adjust the 85% standard. Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the number of
emergency days at a particular non-contracted hospital becomes significant,
AHCCCSA may require a subcontract at that hospital. Hospitals and health
plans/program contractors outside of Maricopa and Pima counties are not included
in this Pilot. Offerors should refer to the "Hospital Reimbursement Pilot
Program Packet" for additional information and requirements.

ALL GSA'S EXCEPT MARICOPA AND PIMA: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals for
member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain contracts with hospitals in all other GSA's and must submit
copies of these contracts to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, at least seven
days prior to the effective dates thereof.

FOR OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state
hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical reviews of all
hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously paid claims are subject to
recoupment. If the Contractor




                                      D-32
<PAGE>

fails to identify lack of medical necessity through concurrent review and/or
prepayment medical review, lack of medical necessity identified during
postpayment medical review shall not constitute a basis to recoupment by the
Contractor. See also Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System. For a more
complete description at the guidelines for hospital reimbursement, please
consult the Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and rules.

36.   NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility
described above applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. To further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member
could be ALTCS eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that
occurs on the same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of services while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor. The Contractor is not responsible for the full 90 days of nursing
facility coverage if ALTCS enrollment occurs before the 90 days has ended.

37.   COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be capitation. SOBRA
supplement, HIV-AIDS supplement, reinsurance, and third party liability, as
described and defined within this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or
policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of ARS Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or NACHA transfer
and will provide the Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective
date of any such change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer nor indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, any
savings remaining to the Contractor as a result of favorable claims experience
and efficiencies in service delivery at the end of the contract term may be kept
by the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be separately
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


                                      D-33
<PAGE>


Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund, as described in ARS ss.36-2913. An error discovered by the State with or
without an audit in the amount of fees paid to Contractor will be subject to
adjustment or repayment by Contractor making a corresponding decrease in a
current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment by AHCCCSA to
the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the Contractor. This
section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from making payment to a
fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required copayment from
members but service will not be denied for inability to pay the copayment.
Except for permitted copayments, the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not
bill or attempt to collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for all prospective member
months, including partial member months. This capitation includes the cost of
providing medically necessary covered services to members during prior period
coverage. AHCCCSA will make monthly capitation payments to the Contractor for
each member enrolled with the Contractor on the first of the month as payment in
full for any and all covered services provided to the member including covered
services provided during prior period coverage. (See Section D, Paragraph 6,
Enrollment and Disenrollment, for clarification of prior period coverage.)
Payment shall be made no later than the fifth working day of the month for which
payment is due. For members enrolled at any time after the beginning of the
month's payment cycle, capitation will be prorated from the effective date of
enrollment through the remainder of the month of enrollment. These payments will
be made by AHCCCS to Contractor on a weekly basis.

SOBRA SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled SOBRA woman who delivers
during an enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a SOBRA payment.
AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time during the term of this contract to
adjust the amount of this SOBRA payment for women who deliver at home. The
Contractor is responsible for meeting the newborn notification requirements
defined in AHCCCS Rule R9-22-342 before this payment will be made to the
Contractor.

HIV/AIDS SUPPLEMENT: In addition to the capitation payment described above, a
separate and additional payment will be made to the Contractor to help defray
costs for members receiving approved protease inhibitors and associated lab work
related to their treatment for HIV/AIDS. The list of AHCCCSA-approved protease
inhibitors is available in the Bidder's Library.

On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, an unduplicated monthly count or members, by rate code, who are using
approved protease inhibitors. The report shall be submitted, along with the
quarterly financial reporting package, within 60 days after the end at each
quarter. (A sample or this reporting form may be found in the Bidder's Library.)



                                      D-34
<PAGE>

The rate of reimbursement for this separate payment will be $634.50 per month
and is subject to review during the term of the contract. Payment will be made
quarterly to the Contractor based on the reported eligible members for the
preceding quarter. AHCCCSA will review this HIV/AIDS-related data at least
annually as part of its Operational and Financial Review and reserves the right
to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members as determined through this
review as well as an associated penalty for incorrect reporting.

38.   CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect of a
program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is needed. In these
instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions discussed with the
Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The Contractor may request a
review of a program change if it believes the program change was not equitable;
AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a.    death of a member

b.    member's incarceration (nor eligible for AHCCCS benefits)

c.    duplicate capitation to the same contractor

If a member is enrolled twice with the same contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39.   REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program provided by
AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered inpatient
facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical condition
beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503). Per diem rates paid for
nursing facility services, including room and board, provided in lieu of
hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall be eligible for
reinsurance coverage (see AHCCCS Rule R9-22-203 subsection B for excluded
services). Reinsurance for the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (See Section
D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement), will be paid in accordance with AHCCCS
Rule R9-22-503.


                                      D-35
<PAGE>


AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Reinsurance coverage applies to both prospective and prior period coverage
periods. The deductible level the Contractor is eligible for is based on the
Contractor's statewide AHCCCS acute care enrollment as of October 1st each
contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown in the following table.
These deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during the term of this
contract.

REGULAR REINSURANCE:


<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Statewide Plan Enrollment     Deductible - MN/MI       Deductible-Others      Coinsurance %
<S>                           <C>                      <C>                    <C>
          0 - 19,999              $ 15,000                 $ 20,000              75%
     20,000 - 49,999              $ 15,000                 $ 35,000              75%
     50,000 and over              $ 15,000                 $ 50,000              75%
</TABLE>

If a Contractor's actual non-MN/MI deductible is $35,000 or $50,000, AHCCCSA
will increase the Contractor's capitation rate awarded by defined amounts for
each capitation risk group. These specific capitation adjustments are available
in the Bidder's Library. A Contractor whose enrollment qualifies it for the
$35,000 or $50,000 non-NM/MI deductible level may, prior to the start of the
contract period, elect one of the lower deductible levels indicated in the above
table.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine regular reinsurance
benefits. Reimbursement for regular reinsurance benefits will be made to the
Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide for a reconciliation of
reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used in the calculation of
reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.

The Contractor shall be subject to utilization and other reviews by AHCCCSA of
care provided to a member which results in a reinsurance claim as referenced in
R9-22-503 (G.3).

Medical review on regular reinsurance cases will be determined based on
statistically valid random sampling. AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director,
will generate the sampling and will notify the Contractor of documentation
needed for the retrospective medical review process to occur at the Contractor's
offices. The results of the medical review sampling will be extrapolated to the
entire regular reinsurance reimbursement population of the Contractor. A
recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor may occur based
on the results of the medical review sampling. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor
at least 45 days advance notice of any on-site review. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor representative shall be available to the
Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review activities. While
on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with work space, access to
a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for conferences. The Contractor will
be furnished a copy of the


                                      D-36
<PAGE>


Regular Acute Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the onsite review and
given an opportunity to comment on any review findings.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia and members who receive covered organ and tissue transplantation
including bone marrow, heart and other organ transplantation. For additional
detail and restrictions see AHCCCS Rule R9-222-202. There is no deductible for
catastrophic reinsurance cases and AHCCCS will reimburse the Contractor at 85%
of the Contractor's covered costs. All catastrophic claims will be subject to
medical review by AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When an eligible member is identified as being catastrophically
eligible by AHCCCSA due to a specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 286.0,
286.1, 286.2 and 286.4), all medically necessary covered services provided
during the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the
Contract's paid amount. Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDA VP responders
that are dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify
AHCCCS Office of the Medical Director, Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis.
Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid for a maximum 30-day retroactive period
from the date of notification to AHCCCSA.

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts, kidney and cornea transplantation services are not
eligible for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the
regular (non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor-paid amount
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits.
However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for
submitting encounters for catastrophic reinsurance services. The initial claims
for reimbursement under the catastrophic reinsurance program must be filed no
later than June 30th of the year following the contract year. Catastrophic
reinsurance claims that are submitted within this time limit and are denied or
adjusted, may be corrected until September 30th of the year following the
contract year. All catastrophic reinsurance claims must be submitted in
accordance with the AHCCCS Reinsurance Policy/Procedure Manual.

40.   COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and postpayment recovery. See Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare
Services and Cost Sharing.


                                      D-37
<PAGE>


COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor's
network. The Contractor's liability for coinsurance and deductibles is limited
to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service pursuant to a
written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service rate, less any
amount paid by the third party. (The Contractor must decide whether it is more
cost-effective to provide the service within its network or pay coinsurance and
deductibles for a service outside its network. For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its network.) If the
Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer (other than
Medicare), and the insurer requires payment in advance of all copayments,
coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so. (See also Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
pre-natal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits. Further, if a
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost
avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that
the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use
of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost avoid. The Contractor shall identify
all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except
in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the
following circumstances unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by
AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance
First and third-party liability insurance
Tortfeasors
Adoption recovery
Estate recovery
Worker's Compensation

                                      D-38
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002. The Contractor shall cooperate with
AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In joint cases
involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the Contractor,
AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing all research,
investigation and payment of lien-related costs. AHCCCSA's authorized
representative is also responsible for negotiating and acting in the best
interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases and may
compromise a settlement in order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal
and other costs. For total plan cases involving only payments from the
Contractor, the Contractor is responsible for performing all research,
investigation and payment of lien-related costs.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a.    Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
      Contractor's financial liability for the member

b.    There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
      reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.)

c.    Such recovery is not prohibited by state or federal law

REPORTING: The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working days of the
identification of a third-party liability case with known reinsurance (often
referred to as joint liability cases). The Contractor shall communicate any
known change in health insurance information, including Medicare to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the
date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the
Bidder's Library.

Approximately every four months, AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor with a
complete file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for
the purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format
prescribed by AHCCCSA.

41.   MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicare and AHCCCS
services. These members are referred to as "dual eligibles" and include persons
who are Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) and non-QMB eligible persons. QMB
eligible persons are entitled to all covered Medicaid services and, in addition,
may receive the following Medicare services which are not covered by AHCCCS or
differ in scope or limitation:

         Chiropractic services
         Inpatient and outpatient occupational therapy coverage
         Inpatient psychiatric services
         Psychological services


                                      D-39
<PAGE>

         Respite services
         Any services covered by or added to the Medicare program which are not
         covered by AHCCCS

For all dual eligible persons, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing
all AHCCCS covered services and pay all Medicare coinsurance and deductibles for
Medicare services which are covered by AHCCCS and provided on a fee-for-service
basis within the Contractor's network. The Contractor's network is defined as
any contracted provider, or provider used more than 12 times during the course
of the contract year, even if no written contract exists. For QMB eligible
persons, the Contractor shall be responsible for paying the Medicare coinsurance
and deductibles for Medicare services not covered by AHCCCS (described above)
which are provided by a Medicare provider on a fee-for-service basis, regardless
of whether the service is provided in or out of the Contractor's network.
Members shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for Medicare
services.

Based on an agreement between AHCCCS and HCFA, Medicare cost sharing
requirements for Medicare services provided on a fee-for-service basis (FFS) and
those services provided by a Medicare HMO are different. Please refer to the
table below:

<PAGE>

The Contractor shall not deny payment of coinsurance and deductibles for
Medicare services provided in network or Medicare-only services provided
out-of-network if the reason for such denial is the failure of the provider to
obtain prior authorization for payment of coinsurance and deductibles.

Since AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort, all Medicare covered services which
are provided to dual eligibles who are not enrolled in a Medicare TEFRA Risk HMO
shall be billed to Medicare or any other third party liability source.

If a dual eligible is enrolled with a Medicare TEFRA Risk HMO, Medicare will not
reimburse the Contractor for Medicare covered services provided by the
Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor shall refer the member to the Medicare
TEFRA Risk HMO for all Medicare covered services and shall not be responsible
for the payment of any Medicare copayments, deductibles or premiums assessed by
the Medicare TEFRA Risk HMO. The Contractor shall be responsible for any AHCCCS
covered services not provided by the Medicare TEFRA Risk HMO.
As of July 1, 1996, persons who are eligible for Medicare and who can receive
Medicare covered services through a Medicare HMO will generally not be approved
or re-approved for the MN/MI program. The following individuals are not eligible
to enroll in a Medicare HMO: (1) those who are taking immunosuppressant drugs
following a transplant, (2) those who have end-stage renal disease, or (3) those
who receive Medicare hospice services. Persons who are not enrolled with
Medicare Part B or a Medicare HMO at the time of application or re-determination
for MN/MI, may receive MN/MI benefits until they can enroll in Medicare Part B
and/or a Medicare HMO.

42.   COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-711.

43.   RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all reasonable times
during the term of this contract and the period set forth in paragraphs a. and
b. below any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by any
authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or federal government.



                                      D-41
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract except as provided
in paragraphs a. and b. below:

a.    If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records
      relating to the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for
      a period of five years from the date of any such termination.

b.    Records which relate to grievances, disputes, litigation or the settlement
      of claims arising out of the performance of this contract, or costs and
      expenses of this contract to which exception has been taken by AHCCCSA,
      shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of five years after the
      date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44.   MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 working days
of receipt of request. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical
record is established when information is received about a member. If the PCP
has not yet seen the member, such information may be kept temporarily in an
appropriately labeled file, in lieu of actually establishing a medical record,
but must be associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is
established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care which comply with the AHCCCS
Medical Policy Manual, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 working days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member if the reason for such request is directly related to the
administration of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed. (ARSss.36-6641)

45.   ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the Office of Managed Care.

46.   ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSA's as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

47.   DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines which is available in the Bidder's Library. The information
so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all procedures,
policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this contract. If any
of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter
changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.


                                      D-43
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted
input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for
any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous
input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
describes the specific technical and procedural requirements for interfaces
between AHCCCS and the Contractor and its subcontractors. The Contractor is
responsible for complying with all technical requirements as stated in this
manual as well as any subsequent changes to the manual. A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI): In addition to the requirements outlined in
Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System, the Contractor will be required
to comply with all EDI standards which result from the Kennedy-Kassebaum
legislation. This law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
provide national electronic submission standards for health care data and may
include compliance with National Provider Identifier requirements. The Secretary
has 18 months to develop these standards. As the standards are finalized,
AHCCCSA will phase in the implementation. Electronic standards which may be
implemented include, but are not limited to, encounters, enrollment and
capitation payments.

48.   ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance measures. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered services for
which the Contractor incurred a financial liability,


                                      D-44
<PAGE>


including services provided during prior period coverage. This requirement is a
condition of the HCFA grant award.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA-supplied formats. Formatting and specific
requirements for encounter data are described in the AHCCCS Encounter Reporting
User Manual and the AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines, copies of which may
be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission Requirements are
included herein as Attachment I.


49.   MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and changes to
members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data which the Contractor shall
use to update its member records. The daily roster which is run prior to the
monthly roster is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate code
changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end of every month.
The roster will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of
the first day of the next month. This roster contains the information used by
AHCCCSA to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month. The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly roster.
After reconciling the monthly roster information, the Contractor resumes posting
daily roster updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month.

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
available in the Bidder's Library for additional information.

50.   TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through 9/30/98. In addition, AHCCCSA
reserves the sole option to extend the term of the contract, not to exceed a
total contracting period of five years. The terms and conditions of any such
contract extension shall remain the same as the original contract, as amended.
Any contract extension, however, shall not affect the maximum contracting period
of five years. All contract extensions shall be through contract amendment. If,
in conjunction with a contract extension, AHCCCSA elects to increase the
capitation rate for any rate code category, such increase will not exceed the
inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contact in one GSA but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another. Further,


                                      D-45
<PAGE>

AHCCCSA may require a contractor to renew all GSA's, or may terminate remaining
GSA's if the Contractor does not agree to renew all GSA's.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the provisions of such
extension will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the extension amendment has not been signed by the
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing
that it refuses to sign the extension amendment. If the Contractor provides such
notification, AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 120 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

51.   SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See policy on claims processing by
subcontracted providers in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing, and shall incorporate by
reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The following subcontracts
shall be submitted to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30
days prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.    Automated data processing

b.    Third-party administrators

c.    Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)

d.    Model subcontracts

e.    Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
      subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

See also Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement, regarding required
submission of hospital subcontracts.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is voidable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of




                                      D-46
<PAGE>

AHCCCSA. All subcontracts shall comply with the applicable provisions of federal
and State laws, regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider the
Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing services on its behalf more
than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions to this requirement include
the following:

a.    If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the contract
      year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the Contractor, the
      Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal to AHCCCS Office of
      Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt to gain such
      agreement.

b.    If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
      physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the
provisions of Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each
subcontract must contain the following:

a.    Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
      consideration to be received by the subcontractor.

b.    Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.

c.    Identification of the population, to include patient capacity, to be
      covered by the subcontractor.

d.    The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be provided, and for
      which compensation will be paid.

e.    The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending dates, methods
      of extension, termination and renegotiation.

f.    The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of
      benefits and determination of third-party liability.

g.    A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and other
      third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or third-party
      liability payment before submitting claims to the Contractor/Contractor.

h.    A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
      keeping system.

i.    Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
      assurance programs and comply with the utilization control and review
      procedures specified in 42 C.F.R. Part 456, as implemented by AHCCCSA.

j.    A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in ownership
      of a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the Contractor
      shall require a contract amendment and prior approval of AHCCCSA.

k.    Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population.

l.    A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all tax
      obligations, Workers Compensation Insurance, and all other applicable
      insurance coverage


                                      D-47
<PAGE>

      obligations which arise under this subcontract. For itself and its
      employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or liability for
      any such taxes or insurance coverage.

m.    A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary authorization
      from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to eligible and/or
      enrolled members.

n.    A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting
      and claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

52.   SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contacts. Specialty contracts shall take
precedence over and supersede existing and future subcontracts for services that
are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving this
requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement for
transplant surgery exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty
contract.

During the term of specialty contacts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contacts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts.

AHCCCSA shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor
prior to the implementation of any specialty contact.

53.   MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontractors and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA Contracting Office as described in
Section D, Paragraph 51, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must be submitted
with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or corporate
allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are determined to
be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment to the
Contractor, the Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or
financial sanctions may be imposed.


                                      D-48
<PAGE>


54.   MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a consultant or actuary
are less than $50,000, AHCCCSA will waive the requirement for an audit of that
consultant or actuary.


55.   MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 15 days after contract
award. Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSAs, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSAs awarded. This requirement is in addition to the
Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57 below and must be
met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirements may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA that
they are currently servicing must meet the equity per member standard (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) for their current
membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must fund
through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet this requirement.
Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional
capitalization for the new GSA they are bidding. (See the table of requirements
by GSA above).




                                      D-49
<PAGE>

Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their
existing membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $5,000,000 in equity.


56.      PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to
providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers: and (2) performance by
the Contractor of its obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond
shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in Performance Bond
Guidelines - Office of Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.    Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers and
      nonproviders by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
      this contract.

b.    Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
      Contractor, and

c.    Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses incurred
      by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under this contract,
      including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after termination of this
      contract for reasons other than the convenience of the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above.

57.      AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid in the month of October, 1997, or as
determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include SOBRA
supplemental payments. This requirement




                                      D-50
<PAGE>

must be satisfied by the Contractor not later than 15 days after notification by
AHCCCSA of the amount required. Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the
enrollment statistics of the Contractor on a monthly basis. If there is an
increase in capitation payment that exceeds 10% of the performance bond amount,
AHCCCSA may require an increase in the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Contractor shall have 15 days following notification by AHCCCSA to increase the
amount of the Performance Bond. The Performance Bond amount that must be
maintained after the contract term shall be sufficient to cover all outstanding
liabilities and will be determined by AHCCCSA.

58.   FINANCIAL VIABILITY CRITERIA/PERFORMANCE MEASURES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability criteria/performance
goals:

Current Ratio                      Current assets divided by current
                                   liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
                                   long-term investments that can be converted
                                   to cash within 24 hours without significant
                                   penalty (i.e., greater than 20%).
                                   Standard: At least 1.00

Equity per Member                  Equity divided by the number of non-SOBRA
                                   Family Planning Extension Services members
                                   enrolled at the end of the period.
                                   Standard: At least $150
                                   (Failure to meet this standard may result in
                                   an enrollment cap being imposed in any or all
                                   contracted GSA's.)
                                   Note:  Equity must be unencumbered with no
                                   liens or obligations against it.

Medical Expense Ratio              Total medical expenses divided by total
                                   capitation + SOBRA + TPL + reinsurance.
                                   Standard:  85-90%

Administrative Cost Percentage     Total administrative expenses (excluding
                                   income taxes), divided by total capitation +
                                   SOBRA + TPL + reinsurance.
                                   Standard: No more than 10%

Received But Unpaid Claims         Received but unpaid claims divided by the
         (Days Outstanding)        average daily medical expenses for the
                                   period, net of sub-capitation expense
                                   Standard: No more than 45 days

59.   MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract
amendment. The Contractor


                                      D-51
<PAGE>

must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or transition plan to AHCCCSA
Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review. The purpose of the plan review is to
ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new entity's ability to
support the provider network, ensure that services to members are not diminished
and that major components of the organization and AHCCCS programs are not
adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or change in ownership.

60.   SANCTIONS

ALHCCCSA may suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or terminate this contract or any
related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-405 and the terms of
this contract and applicable law and regulations. AHCCCSA may, in addition to
these remedies, impose monetary sanctions if the Contractor violates any
provision stated in law or this contract in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-406 and the provisions of this contract, applicable law and regulations.
Written notice will be provided to the Contractor specifying the sanction to be
imposed, the grounds for such sanction and either the length of suspension or
the amount of capitation prepayment to be withheld. The Contractor may appeal
the decision to impose a sanction in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-804.

In addition to the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose partial or
full enrollment caps on the Contractor. Among the contract violations that may
result in an enrollment cap are, but are not limited to, the following:

      a.  Marketing violations

      b.  Failure to meet AHCCCS financial viability standards

      c.  Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network

      d.  Quality of care and quality management issues

Cure Notice Process - Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of sanctions.


61.   AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to contractors
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm favors those
contractors with lower capitation rates. For further details on the AHCCCS
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change the
algorithm at any


                                      D-52
<PAGE>

time during the term of the contract and frequently does so in response to
contractor-specific issues of non-compliance (e.g. imposition or an enrollment
cap). The Contractor should consider this in preparing its response to this RFP.
AHCCCSA is not obligated to adjust for any financial impacts this may have on
the Contractor.

62.   GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. This written policy shall be in accordance with applicable federal
and State law and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not limited to, AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22-802; and R9-22-804. The grievance process
may not be delegated or subcontracted outside of the health plan. Refer to
Attachment H for a complete description of grievance process requirements.

63.   QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Grievance and Appeals, using the Quarterly Grievance Report Format on file in
the Bidder's Library. The Quarterly Grievance Report must be received by the
AHCCCSA, Office of Grievance and Appeals, no later than 45 days from the end of
the quarter.

64.   PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

In addition to the requirements described in this RFP, there are several
legislative issues that could have an impact on services provided by the
Contractor on or after October 1, 1997. The following is a brief description of
the issues that AHCCCS is aware of at the time of the issuance of this RFP:

ELIGIBILITY BASED ON 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL): Through a
successful initiative effort, eligibility for AHCCCS has been expanded to allow
persons with income up to 100% of the FPL to become eligible for the Medicaid
program. Legislative action will be required to implement this new eligibility
guideline and HCFA must approve the expansion. If HCFA approval is granted,
there will be a significant number of new persons who will be eligible for the
program and enrolled with the health plans at some future date.

MANDATORY 48 HOUR MATERNITY STAY: Effective January 1, 1998, a new federal law
requires all group health insurers to allow women and their newborns to receive
48 hours of inpatient hospital care after a normal vaginal delivery and up to 96
hours of inpatient care after a cesarean delivery. The attending health care
provider, in consultation with the mother, may discharge the mother or newborn
prior to the minimum length of stay. HCFA has advised that the mandatory stay
provisions will apply to Medicaid. In preparing their capitation rate proposals,
offerors must assume any additional costs associated with this new requirement.
AHCCCSA will not compensate for additional costs effective January 1, 1998.


                                      D-53
<PAGE>


PREMIUM SHARING: The Arizona legislature passed legislation (Chapter 368, Laws
of 1996) which authorizes a 6-member legislative committee to make
recommendations for a three-year premium sharing demonstration program for
persons whose income does not exceed 300% of FPL. If enacted, the premium
sharing program would add additional people to the AHCCCS program. The program
is scheduled to begin October 1, 1997 but will be repealed if the legislature
does not implement a program by December 31, 1997.

WELFARE REFORM: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996
replaces the AFDC entitlement program with Temporary Assistance to Needy
Families block grants to the states. In addition, states were given an option to
provide full Medicaid services or only emergency services to several groups of
legal immigrants who were in the United States on or before August 22, 1996. The
legislature will be considering the various options and making decisions about
the level of service to legal immigrants. Depending on the outcome of
legislative deliberations, there may be changes to AHCCCS eligibility.

GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (GME): The legislature may be making changes to the
funding formula for GME. Currently, GME is funded as an add-on to the AHCCCS
tiered per diem inpatient hospital rates. There is legislation to remove the GME
component from the hospital rates and establish a separate GME fund. For
purposes of your response to the RFP, please assume that GME will not be
included in the AHCCCS tiered per diem rates.

                       SECTION H: INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

1.   CONTENTS OF OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL

All proposals shall be organized with strict adherence to the Offeror's
Checklist (Attachment L) as described in this section and submitted using the
forms and computer disk provided in this RFP. The Offerer's Checklist refers to
specific RFP page numbers for each requirement. All pages of the Offerer's
proposal must be numbered sequentially with documents placed in sturdy 3-ring
binders. Erasures, interlineations or other modifications in the proposal must
be initialed in original ink by the authorized person signing the offer. AHCCCSA
will not reimburse the Offeror the cost of proposal preparation.

It is the responsibility of the Offeror to examine the entire RFP, seek
clarification of any requirement that may not be clear, and check all responses
for accuracy before submitting its proposal. The proposal becomes a part of the
contract; thus what is stated in the proposal may be evaluated either during the
proposal evaluation process or during other reviews. Proposals may not be
withdrawn after the published due date and time.

All proposals will become the property of AHCCCSA. The Offeror may designate
certain information to be proprietary in nature by typing the word "proprietary"
on top of every page for which nondisclosure is requested. Final determinations
of nondisclosure, however, rest with the AHCCCSA Director. Regardless of such
determinations, all portions of the Offeror's proposal, even pages which are
proprietary, will be provided to HCFA and its evaluation contractor.

All proposals shall be organized according to the following major categories:

I.       General Matters
II.      Provider Network
III.     Capitation
IV.      Program Operations
V.       Organization

Each section shall be separated by a divider and contain all information
requested in this solicitation. Numbering of pages should continue in sequence
through each separate section. For example, "Provider Network" would begin with
the page number following the last page number in "General Matters". Each
section shall begin with a table of contents.

Proposals that are not submitted in conformance with the guidelines described
herein will not be considered. For a continuing offeror, the CYE 97 Operational
and Financial Reviews (CYE 97 Review), AHCCCS member survey, and other existing
experience with the Offeror will be used as part of the evaluation of the new
proposal submitted for CYE 98.

I.       GENERAL MATTERS

See the Offeror's Checklist (Attachment L) for information to be submitted under
this section.

II.      PROVIDER NETWORK

III.     CAPITATION

Capitation is a fixed (per member) monthly payment to Contractor for the
provision of covered services to members. It is an actuarially sound amount to
cover expected utilization and costs for the individual rate codes in a
risk-sharing managed care environment. In addition, AHCCCSA offers reinsurance
programs to provide Contractor with protection from unusual and unforeseen
costs.

The Offeror must demonstrate that the capitation rates proposed are actuarially
sound. In general terms, this means that the Offeror who is awarded a contract
should be able to keep utilization at


<PAGE>
or below its proposed levels and that it will be able to contract for unit costs
that average at or below the amounts shown on its Capitation Rate Calculation
Sheet The Offeror may require assistance from an actuary to develop some of the
fundamental assumptions for meeting the criteria defined above.

To facilitate the preparation of its capitation proposals, AHCCCSA will provide
each offeror with a Data Supplement Book. This book should not be used as the
sole source of information in making decisions concerning the capitation
proposal. Each offeror is solely responsible for research, preparation, and
documentation of its capitation proposal.

Required Submission:       Capitation


17.      The Offeror must submit its capitation proposal using the AHCCCSA
         computer bid disk. Attachment E to this solicitation contains detailed
         instructions for using the computer bid disk program.

Offeror must prepare and submit its capitation proposal assuming a $20,000
deductible level for regular reinsurance for all rate codes (except $15,000
deductible for MN/MI) in all counties. AHCCCSA will provide a table of PM/PM
reinsurance adjustments to be made to capitation rates for those contractors
whose actual deductible level exceeds $20,000. (See Section D, Paragraph 39,
Reinsurance.)

Graduate Medical Education (GME) - The Offeror must delete this component from
the inpatient tiers in its capitation proposal; information regarding GME will
be included in the Bidder's Library. See also Section D, Paragraph 64, Pending
Legislative Issues.

capitation proposal for the 48-hour maternity stay described in Section D,
Paragraph 64, Pending Legislative Issues. No subsequent adjustments will be

4.       PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS' CONFERENCES

A New Offerors' Conference will be held on March 4, 1997 from 9 a..m. until
noon, at the 701 E. Jefferson, 3rd Floor Conference Room. The purpose of this

AHCCCS program. Then from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. there will be a Prospective Offerors'
conference for all new and continuing offerors. The purpose of this second
conference is to clarify the contents of this solicitation and to avoid any
misunderstandings regarding AHCCCSA requirements. Any doubt as to the contents
and requirements of this solicitation or any apparent omission or discrepancy
should be presented at this conference. AHCCCSA will then determine the action
necessary and issue a written amendment to the solicitation, if appropriate.

5.       LATE PROPOSALS

<PAGE>

7.       AMENDMENTS TO RFP

Amendments may be issued subsequent to the issue date of this solicitation.
Receipt of solicitation amendments must be acknowledged by signing and returning
the signature page of the amendment to AHCCCSA.


8.       BEST AND FINAL OFFERS

AHCCCSA reserves the right to accept any or all initial offers without further
negotiation and may choose not to request a best and final offer (BFO). Offerors
are therefore advised to submit their most competitive offers at the outset. If
it is considered in the best interest of the State, however, AHCCCSA may issue a
written request to all offerors for a best and final offer in a particular
geographic service area or areas. The purpose of a BFO request is to allow
offerors an opportunity to resubmit bids for rate codes not previously accepted
by AHCCCSA. This request will notify them of the date, time and place for the
submission of their offers. In addition. AHCCCSA will disclose to each offeror
which of its bid rates are acceptable (within or below actuarial rate range) and
which are not acceptable (above the actuarial rate range). All offerors whose
final bid rates fall below the bottom of the actuarial rate range will have
their rates increased to the bottom of that rate range after the final BFO. If
an offeror does not submit a notice of withdrawal or a best and final offer, its
immediate previous offer will be considered its best and final offer.

All BFOs must be submitted on the computer disk provided by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA
will limit the number of BFO rounds if it is in the best interest of the State.
Offerors will be permitted within the restrictions and limitations defined
below, to adjust upward a capitation rate for a rate code that was previously
accepted to offset the reduction of a capitation rate in another rate code in
the first BFO round only. These restrictions and limitations include, but are
not limited to:

a.       An offeror will be allowed to adjust upward a previously accepted rate
         code bid only during the first BFO round;

b.       The weighted amount of BFO increase cannot exceed the weighted amount
         of BFO reduction. AHCCCSA will furnish the Offeror the enrollment
         percentages, by rate code, by GSA, to be used in determining the
         weighted amount. Should the weighted amount of the adjustment exceed
         the weighted amount of the BFO reduction, AHCCCSA shall reject the
         first BFO and the adjustment (costing the Offeror the loss of the first
         BFO round in that GSA). Since a rate code can only be adjusted during
         the first BFO round, the Offeror will lose the opportunity to make an
         upward capitation adjustment to previously accepted rate code bids in
         that GSA.

         For example, assume that MN/MI was the rate code where a BFO was needed
         and the offeror reduced this rate by $10. PMPM. Also assume the MN/MI
         rate code accounted for 9% of the members in the GSA.

         Weighted Average Capitation Reduction - 9% X $10.00 =$.90.

<PAGE>

         Assume the rate code adjusted upward was TANF and this rate code was
         increased by $2.00 PMPM. Also assume this rate code accounted for 50%
         of the members in the GSA.

         Weighted Average Capitation Increase - 50% X $2.00 = $1.00

         Therefore, the BFO would be rejected because the weighted amount of the
         BFO adjustment exceeded the weighted amount of the BFO reduction.

c.       If an adjustment during the initial BFO round causes the Offeror to
         exceed the upper range of any rate code, AHCCCSA will reject the
         adjustment and return the (adjusted) rate code to the initial
         capitation rate bid by the Offeror. Since a previously accepted rate
         code bid can only be adjusted during the first BFO round, the Offeror
         will lose the opportunity to make an upward capitation adjustment for
         this rate code.

d.       AHCCCSA reserves the sole right to accept or reject any adjustment. The
         Offeror by submitting an adjustment to a rate code is requesting
         approval by AHCCCSA; such approval shall not be automatic. If an
         initial bid is below the bottom of a rate range, it cannot be adjusted
         downward by the Offeror in a BFO round.

Capitation Rates Offered after the BFOs: As stated above, AHCCCSA may limit the
number of BFO rounds. After the final BFO round is complete, provided it is in
the best interest of the state, AHCCCSA will cease issuing BFO requests. At this
point, should the Offeror have a rate code(s) without an accepted capitation
rate, AHCCCSA shall offer a capitation rate to the Offeror. The capitation rate
offered shall be somewhere in the bottom half of the rate range (specific
placement to be determined by AHCCCSA and its actuaries). Note that all rates
offered in this manner shall be identical for all offerors in the same GSA and
rate code.


9.       AWARD OF CONTRACT

AHCCCSA has determined that the provision of covered services to eligible
populations in the Geographic Service Areas as described below will stabilize
risk sharing. The Offeror must therefore bid on at least one entire GSA in order
to be considered for a contract award. If deemed in the best interest of the
State, AHCCCSA may limit the number of GSA's awarded to any one offeror.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this solicitation, AHCCCSA expressly
reserves the right to:

a.       Waive any immaterial mistake or informality;

b.       Reject any or all proposals or portions thereof; and/or

c.       Reissue a Request for Proposals

If two plans or their parents merge after obtaining contract awards, AHCCCS
retains the right to address each merger issue on an individual basis according
to what is deemed in the best interest of the State. AHCCCS is aware that APIPA
and Mercy Care may merge, therefore, we have

<PAGE>

notified these plans that we require certification from both plans that those
who work on the APIPA bid and those that work on Mercy Care bid, have not
received, heard or discussed any non-public information about or with the other
in preparing their respective bids. Pending this certification from APIPA and
Mercy Care we shall consider their respective bid proposals.

Effective retroactively to October 1, 1994, Mercy Care Plan is considered to be
an incumbent health plan in Santa Cruz County and APIPA is considered to be an
incumbent health plan in Cochise County.

If there are significant compliance issues with a current plan or a plan's
contract in a particular county has been previously terminated, AHCCCS retains
the right to address each compliance or termination issue on an individual basis
according to what is deemed in the best interest of the State. A new bid
proposal may not be accepted until it has been determined that the reason for
the significant compliance or termination issue has been resolved and there is a
reasonable assurance that it will not recur. Further, points may be deducted
from an offeror's score as described in Section 1 of this contract.

A response to this Request for Proposals is an offer to contract with AHCCCSA
based upon the terms, conditions, scope of work and specifications of the RFP.
Proposals do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted by the
Contracting Officer. A contract is formed when the AHCCCSA Contracting Officer
signs the award page and provides written notice of the award(s) to the
successful offeror(s). For that reason, all of the terms and conditions of the
contract are contained in this solicitation, solicitation amendments and
subsequent contract amendments, if any, signed by the Contracting Officer.
AHCCCSA may also, at its sole option, modify any requirements described herein.
All offerors will be promptly notified of award.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to specify and/or modify the number of contracts to
be awarded in any GSA. AHCCCSA anticipates awarding contracts as follows:

<TABLE>

9.               Cochise, Santa Cruz              Maximum of 2
</TABLE>

An existing contractor in Maricopa or Pima county who is not awarded a new
contract may request to have its enrollment capped and to continue providing
services under the terms and conditions of this new RFP. AHCCCSA may, at its
sole option, want or deny such a request. If AHCCCSA approves such an enrollment
cap, the contractor would continue to serve its existing members but receive no
new ones. The enrollment cap will not be lifted during the term of this or any
subsequent contract period unless one of the following conditions exist:

<PAGE>

a.       Another health plan is terminated and increased member capacity is
         needed, or

b.       Legislative action creates a sudden and substantial increase in the
         overall AHCCCS population, or

c.       Extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances make such an action
         necessary and in the best interest of the State.

In the event two or more competing proposals are received, and one of the
proposals is from an incumbent health plan, AHCCCSA may, at its sole option and
in the interest of continuity of care, waive negligible differences in overall
evaluation scores and award the contract to the incumbent health plan.

Finally, in the event of significant non-compliance issues with a contractor in
a particular GSA, AHCCCSA may refer back to the results of the evaluation of
this solicitation and select another contractor for a particular GSA that is
considered to be in the best interest of the State.

               SECTION I: EVALUATION FACTORS AND SELECTION PROCESS

AHCCCSA has established a scoring methodology which is designed to evaluate
fairly an offeror's ability to provide cost-effective, high-quality contract
services in a managed care setting. The following factors will be evaluated:

         1.       Provider Network

         2.       Capitation

         3.       Program

         4.       Organization

         5.       On-site review (for new Offerors only)

It is anticipated that capitation and the network development portion of
provider network will be scored by Geographic Service Area. The remaining
provider network management, organization and program are anticipated to be
scored statewide, not specific to any geographic service area. The scores
received for each of the four components will be weighted separately and
combined to derive a final score for the Offeror, by Geographic Service Area.
Contracts will be awarded to qualified offerors whose proposals are deemed to be
most advantageous to the State in accordance with Section H, Paragraph 9, Award
of Contract.

AHCCCSA will consider the past performance and experience of continuing offerors
as a factor in evaluating their proposals. In certain instances, as described in
Section H, a continuing offeror may be excused from certain submission
requirements. In these instances, a continuing offeror will receive "full
points" for a particular area if AHCCCSA has determined through experience that
the Offeror meets requirements in a particular area. Conversely, AHCCCSA may
deduct points based upon past performance and experience that is not, or was
not, in compliance with AHCCCSA requirements. In the event two or more competing
proposals are received for a particular GSA, and one of the proposals is from an
incumbent health plan, AHCCCSA may, at its sole option and in the interest of
continuity of care, waive negligible differences in overall evaluation scores
and award the contract to the incumbent health plan.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to waive immaterial defects or omissions in this
solicitation or submitted proposals. The Offeror should note that, if
successful, it must meet all AHCCCS requirements, irrespective of what is
requested and evaluated through this solicitation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the components listed below will be evaluated against relevant statutes,
AHCCCSA rules, regulations and policies and the requirements contained in this
RFP. The Offeror's Checklist (Attachment L) contains RFP references for each of
these items:

1.       PROVIDER NETWORK

The provider network will be evaluated and scored with reference to the
Offeror's network development and network management. Network development is
defined as the process of developing contractual arrangements with a sufficient
number of providers capable of delivering all covered services to AHCCCS members
in accordance with AHCCCSA standards (e.g.,


<PAGE>

appointment times). AHCCCSA will use the Health Plan Provider Affiliation Tape
Submission and/or completed letters of intent with other required materials to
evaluate and score network development. The Offeror's network will be evaluated
by service and by site in each GSA bid by the Offeror. The Offeror should note
that Attachment B of this solicitation identifies minimum-geographic standards
for a provider network.

Network management is defined as the process by which the Offeror certifies,
monitors, evaluates and communicates with its network. AHCCCSA anticipates
evaluating and scoring the Offeror's submitted materials relative to the
following areas:

a.       Monitoring and control of network

b.       Network communications

c.       Network capacity issues and analysis

d.       Medical Director oversight

2.       CAPITATION

The Offeror shall submit initial capitation bids by rate code grouping within a
geographic service area. These initial bids will be evaluated and scored. The
lowest bid within each geographic service area and rate code grouping will
receive the maximum allowable points. If a bid is below the actuarial rate range
the bid will be evaluated as if it were at the bottom of the actuarial rate
range. No additional points will be given for bids below the actuarial rate
range. Conversely, the highest bid (within or above the actuarial rate range)
will receive the least number of points.

If AHCCCSA requests best and final offers, these will be scored using the same
methodology as was used to score the initial bids. The initial and final bids
will receive equal weighting for scoring. Offerors should note that AHCCCSA may
not offer the opportunity to submit best and final offers.

3.       PROGRAM

AHCCCSA will evaluate the Offeror's responsiveness to the requirements of this
solicitation and AHCCCSA policies. In particular, it is anticipated that the
Offeror's proposal regarding the following will be evaluated:

a.       Quality Management/Utilization Management

b.       Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT)

c.       Maternal/Women's Health

d.       Member Services

e.       Behavioral Health


<PAGE>



4.       ORGANIZATION

Organization refers to the Offeror's prospective ability to perform the
administrative tasks necessary to support the requirements identified in this
solicitation. It is anticipated that the following areas will be evaluated:

a.       Key personnel

b.       Claims payment, including third party collections

c.       Financial standards, including performance bond

d.       Liability management (Incurred But Not Reported claims and Received But
         Unpaid Claims)

e.       Encounter submission

f.       Grievance and appeals

g.       Fraud and abuse

h.       Model subcontracts

5.       NEW OFFEROR REVIEWS

AHCCCSA will conduct New Offeror Reviews prior to award of contracts. These
reviews will be approximately 6 hours in length and will be conducted on-site at
the Offeror's place of business. These reviews are anticipated to take place
between May 15, 1997 and June 6, 1997 and will be scored on a pass/fail basis. A
new offeror must meet substantially all of the requirements noted in the New
Offeror Review Guide (see Attachment J) in order to be further considered for
contract award. The areas anticipated to be reviewed during the on-site review
are as follows:

a.       Interviews and review of qualifications of key management staff

b.       Claims processing, including a review of remittance advices

c.       Review of management information system

d.       Review of quality management activities

e.       Review of accounting system, including calculations of IBNRs and RBUCs

f.       Tour of offices and facilities

New offerors should ensure that key personnel are available during the on-site
review. There will be no follow-up visits. New offerors must have the required
infrastructure in place in order for AHCCCS to conduct its review and be
eligible for further consideration for contract award.

ATTACHMENT B:     MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS

                          (By Geographic Service Area)

INSTRUCTIONS

Note: Offerors are permitted to bid only by Geographic Service Area. Please see
Section H, Paragraph 9, Award of Contracts, for further information on bidding
by Geographic Services Area.

Offerors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of meeting
contract requirements. The information that follows describes the minimum
network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA). The minimum bid is a
single entire GSA, as depicted on the following page.

In some GSA's there are required service sites located outside of the
geographical boundary of a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical access
to care. In certain instances, a member must travel a much greater distance to
receive services within their assigned GSA if the member were not allowed to
receive services in an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which straddle
two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these zip codes is
based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip code has been assigned by
AHCCCS. The Offeror shall be responsible for providing services to members
residing in the entire zip code that is assigned to the GSA for which the
Offeror has agreed to provide services. The split zip codes GSA assignments are
as follows:

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, and pediatrics) are not
included in the primary care provider contract, at least one subcontract is
required for each of these specialties in the service sites specified. General
surgeons must be available within 50 miles of service sites.

In Tucson (GSA 5) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 6), the Offeror must demonstrate
its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that members don't
need to travel more than 5 miles from their residence. Metropolitan Phoenix is
defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific to GSA #6.

Offerors bidding in GSA's other than GSA 5 and GSA 6 are encouraged to contract
with the hospitals in their provider network. However, AHCCCSA will not award
additional points in the evaluation process for hospital contracts in rural
areas. At a minimum, the Offeror shall have a physician with admitting and
treatment privileges with each hospital in its network. Offerors bidding in GSA
5 and/or GSA 6 must have at least one hospital contract in each service district
as depicted on the respective maps for GSA 5 and GSA 6. This requirement is part
of the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program. described more fully in Section D,
Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement. For offerors' convenience, a list of
Phoenix and Tucson area hospitals are included on the reverse of the Phoenix and
Tucson maps which follow.

Provider categories required at various service delivery sites included in the
Service Area Minimum Network Standards are indicated as follows:

         H        Hospitals

         P        Primary Care Providers (physicians, certified nurse

          ATTACHMENT E: INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING CAPITATION PROPOSAL

INTRODUCTION:

All capitation proposals must be submitted to AHCCCSA on the AHCCCS Capitation
Rate Calculation Sheet (CRCS) Bid Disk. All best and final offers must also be
submitted on the AHCCCS CRCS Bid Disk. A CRCS must be completed for each rate
code in each Geographic Service Area (GSA) that the Offeror is bidding. The
Offeror must also use the CRCS Bid Disk to print and submit Section B,
Capitation Rates, of the Request for Proposal (RFP).

BID DISK CHANGES FROM CYE 95:

Several modifications have been made to the CRCS Bid Disk since the CYE 95 bid
year. The changes are summarized as follows:

a.       The "Prepared by" and "Preparation Date" have been deleted from the bid
         disk screens. Now the program will automatically print the current date
         when the Offeror prints the reports.
b.       MN/MI with Medicare and MN/MI without Medicare will be bid as one rate
         code: MN/MI.
c.       The TANF (previously AFDC) and CCP rate codes have been combined so
         that the Offeror will bid both populations under one rate code. In
         addition, the TANF/CCP rate code will be bid on an age/sex basis.
d.       Several service lines on the CRCS have been changed. "Hospital
         Outpatient" has been changed to "Outpatient Facility". The term
         "Surgical Service" has been removed. "Other Professional" has been
         added to account for services related to Physician Assistants, Nurse
         Midwives, Nurse Practitioners, etc. Finally, the "Family Planning" and
         "Mental Health" lines have been removed. These costs should now be
         reported as part of the "Other Costs - Miscellaneous" line item.
e.       Another change in rates code screens is the addition of the SOBRA
         Family Planning screens. Women whose SOBRA eligibility has been
         terminated are eligible only for family planning services for a maximum
         of 24 months under the SOBRA Family Planning Services Extension
         Program. Previously paid on a fee-for-service basis by AHCCCS, these
         services will now be paid on a capitated basis and the Offeror is
         required to complete a CRCS for these services.
f.       Screen 3 of 3 of the SOBRA Supplemental has been modified to add a line
         to show the capitation offset to the total cost of services related to
         SOBRA births. The program will automatically calculate this line item
         by taking 6 months (the average number of months of capitation
         typically paid a contractor for a SOBRA women) times the Offeror's bid
         per the CRCS for the TANF/CCP 14-44 year-olds (F) rate code.
g.       In accordance with Section H, Paragraph 9, Award of Contract, of the
         RFP, bid screens are presented by rate code and by Geographic Service
         Area, rather than by rate code and by county.

HELP SCREENS:

The CYE 98 CRCS Bid Disk has Help screens available to answer questions every
step of the way. The Offeror can access the Help screens at any time by pressing
the Fl key. In addition, the program contains on-screen instructions for each
screen.

GETTING STARTED:

The CYE 98 CRCS Bid Disk program requires approximately 525K bytes of available
main memory to run properly. Boot your machine to the DOS prompt. Insert the CYE
98 CRCS Bid Disk. Change the default drive to the disk drive containing the CYE
98 CRCS Bid Disk by typing "A:" or "B:" (whichever
<PAGE>

drive contains the CYE 98 Bid Disk) and press the [Enter] key. Type "CRCS98" and
press the [Enter] key. This will initiate the program and will bring up the main
menu.

MAIN MENU OPTIONS:

The main menu to the CYE 98 CRCS Bid Disk offers the following seven options:

1.   Bidding         Input or Edit capitation rate data.
2.   Summary         Display previously calculated net capitation rates for all
                     rate codes and all Geographic Service Areas.
3.   Print           Send detail and/or summary information to the printer.
4.   Submit/Copy     Copy capitation bids to diskette for submission of data to
                     AHCCCS.
5.   Supplement      Browse through sections of RFP directly related to this
                     bid program.
6.   Utilities       Set screen colors, change printer destination, bulk erase
                     data, etc.
7.   Exit            Leave this program.

FORMAT OF CAPITATION RATE CALCULATION SHEET:

The CRCS for all rate codes consists of three screens requiting data input. For
all rate codes, except SOBRA women and SOBRA Family Planning, screen 1 of 3
contains the following bid elements: 1) Hospital Inpatient, 2) Outpatient
Facility, 3) Emergency Roam, 4) Primary Care, 5) Referral Physician, 6) Other
Professional, and 7) Pharmacy. The Offeror will have to enter: annual
utilization units per 1,000 members, cost per unit, and co-pay amounts (where
applicable) for each of the seven bid elements listed above. The program will
automatically calculate the per member per month (PMPM) amount for each of these
bid elements.

Screen 2 of 3 for all rate codes, except SOBRA women and SOBRA Family Planning,
contains the following bid elements: 1) Lab, X-ray, and Medical Imaging, 2)
Physical Therapy, 3) DME and Oxygen, 4) NP and Home Health Care, 5) Ambulance
and Medically Necessary Transportation, 6) Dental, and 7) Miscellaneous. The
Offeror must enter the PMPM amount for each of these seven bid elements.

Screen 3 of 3 for all rate codes, except SOBRA women and SOBRA Family Planning,
contains the following bid elements: 1) Reinsurance, 2) Third Party Recoveries,
3) Administration Charges, 4) Profit and Contingencies. The Offeror must enter
the PMPM amount for each of these four bid elements. The program will
automatically calculate the Net Capitation Rate based on data entered.

The SOBRA women rate codes are capitated on a monthly basis at the TANF/CCP
capitation rate for the GSA of residence. The SOBRA CRCS to be completed by the
Offeror is for the SOBRA Supplement payment only. The Contractor will be
eligible to receive the SOBRA Supplement payment upon the birth of a child to a
SOBRA eligible women enrolled with the Contractor.

The CRCS for the SOBRA Supplement is comprised of 3 screens requiring data
input. Screen 1 of 3 for the SOBRA Supplement contains the following bid
elements: 1) Hospital Inpatient, 2) Lab and Testing, 3) Transportation, 4)
Pharmacy, 5) OB/GYN, 6) Specialist/Anesthesia, and 7) Other. Elements 1 through
4 require utilization units and unit costs to be entered for a vaginal delivery
and separately for a cesarean delivery. The program computes the amount per
birth automatically for these elements. The Offeror shall enter the per birth
amount directly for bid elements 5 through 7.

Screen 2 of 3 for the SOBRA Supplement contains the following bid elements: 1)
Third Party Recoveries, 2) Administration Charges, 3) Profit and Contingencies.
The Offeror shall enter the per birth amounts for vaginal and cesarean
deliveries for each of these bid elements. The Offeror must enter the percent of
<PAGE>

vaginal deliveries expected (must be between 50-100%). The program will
calculate the weighted average SOBRA Supplement bid automatically.

Screen 3 of 3 for the SOBRA Supplement details the calculation for the
Capitation Offset and Net Capitation Rate. The program will calculate both items
automatically.

The CRCS for SOBRA Family Planning is comprised of 3 screens requiring data
input. Screen 1 of 3 contains the following bid elements: 1) Outpatient
Facility, 2) Primary Care, 3) Referral Physician, 4) Other Professional, and 5)
Pharmacy. The Offeror must enter: annual utilization units per 1,000 members,
cost per unit, and co-pay amounts (where applicable) for each of the five bid
elements listed above. The program will automatically calculate the per member
per month (PMPM) amount for each of these bid elements.

Screen 2 of 3 for SOBRA Family Planning, contains the following bid elements: 1)
Lab, X-ray, and Medical Imaging, 2) Medically Necessary Transportation, and 3)
Miscellaneous. The Offeror shall enter the PMPM amount for each of these three
bid elements.

Screen 3 of 3 for SOBRA Family Planning, contains the following bid elements: 1)
Third Party Recoveries, 2) Administration Charges, 3) Profit and Contingencies.
The Offeror must enter the PMPM amount for each of these three bid elements. The
program will automatically calculate the Net Capitation rate based on data
entered.

INSTALLING CRCS BID DISK ON A NETWORK OR HARD DRIVE

The CRCS Bid Disk can be copied to a directory on a network or a local PC hard
drive merely by copying all of the files on the disk to a directory. If the
program is installed on a network, care must be taken to allow only one person
at a time to use the program or a loss of bid data could occur. To run the
program on a local PC hard drive, you must first switch over to the drive and
directory where the program is located before running the program for it to run
properly.

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right are assigned to contractors
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals.

The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case may be
a member or a household of members) to contractors using the target percentages
developed. The algorithm data table consists of all the zip codes in the state,
all contractors serving each zip code area, and the target percentages by rate
code within each zip code.

The contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a zip code and
rate code, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case for that
zip code. The equation used is:

         (t/T) - P = d

t = The total members assigned to the zip code per rate code category for the
    contractor
T = The total members assigned to the zip code per rate code category, all
    contractors combined
P = The target percentage of members for the rate code for the contractor
d = The difference

The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference for
each contractor. When more than one contractor has the same difference, and
their differences are greater than all other contractors, the contractor with
the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.

The member population assigned by the algorithm includes:

1.   MN/MI members that are newly eligible to the AHCCCS program.
2.   Members that are categorically eligible (plus EAC and ELIC) that did not
     choose a contractor within the prescribed time limits.
3.   MN/MI members who have been enrolled with a contractor but have changed zip
     codes and the previous contractor is not available in the new zip code.
4.   MN/MI members with a break in eligibility of 90 days or greater.

All contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each rate
code, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members
accordingly. A contractor with a more favorable target percentage in the
algorithm will receive proportionally more members. Conversely, a contractor
with a lower target percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally
fewer members. The algorithm favors contractors with both lower final bids and
awarded rates. The algorithm also favors those contractors with programs that
score higher based on AHCCCSA's evaluation criteria.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE TARGET PERCENTAGES FOR CATEGORICAL MEMBERS (INCLUDING EAC AND
ELIC)

For the first year of the contract, the algorithm target percentages will be
developed using the methodology described below. However, for subsequent years,
AHCCCS reserves the right to change the algorithm methodology to assure
assignments are made in the best interest of the AHCCCS program and the state.
<PAGE>

For the categorical rate codes (plus EAC and ELIC), a contractor's placement in
the algorithm is based upon the following three factors which are weighted
equally (i.e., 33.33%):

1.   The final capitation rate bid submitted by the contractor. Final bids that
     are below the bottom of the rate range will be assigned to the bottom of
     the rate range for development of the target percentages.
2.   The contractor's final awarded rate from AHCCCSA.
3.   The contractor's score on the Program component of the proposal.

Points will be assigned to each contractor by rate code by GSA. Based on the
rankings of the final bids submitted and the final awarded rates, each
contractor will be assigned a number of points for each of these two components
separately as follows:

ATTACHMENT H: GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. This written policy shall be in accordance with applicable federal
and State law and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not limited to, AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22-802; and R9-22-804. It shall include the
following provisions:

a.     The grievance procedure will be provided to members upon enrollment, to
       all subcontractors at time of contract, and to non-contracting providers
       within 10 days of the date of receipt of the claim. For non-contracting
       providers, the grievance procedure may be mailed with the remittance
       advice provided the remittance is sent within 45 days of receipt of
       claim.
b.     Specific individual(s) are appointed with authority to require corrective
       action to administer the grievance policy.
c.     A log is maintained for all grievances containing sufficient information
       to identify the grievant, date of receipt, nature of the grievance and
       the date grievance is resolved.
d.     Within five working days of receipt, the grievant is informed by letter
       that the grievance has been received. The letter must also be in a second
       language when 200 members or 5% of the Contractor's enrolled population,
       whichever is greater, is non-English speaking.
e.     Each grievance is thoroughly investigated using the applicable statutory,
       regulatory and contractual provisions as well as the Contractor's
       policies and procedures, ensuring that facts are gathered from all
       parties.
f.     All documentation received and mailed by Contractor during the grievance
       process is dated.
g.     All grievances are filed in a secure, designated area and are retained
       for five years following the final decision, judicial appeal or close of
       a grievance.
h.     A copy of the Contractor's final decision will be either hand-delivered
       or delivered by certified mail to all parties whose interest has been
       adversely affected by the decision. The final decision shall be mailed to
       all other parties by regular mail. The date of the final decision shall
       be the date of personal delivery or, if mailed, the postmark date of the
       mailing. The final decision must include, and describe in detail, the
       following:
       1.     the nature of the grievance
       2.     the issues involved
       3.     the reasons supporting the Contractor's decision including
              references to applicable statute, rule and procedure
       4.     the grievant's right to appeal the Contractor's decision to
              AHCCCSA by filing the appeal to the Contractor no later than 15
              days alter the date of the Contractor's final decision. This must
              also be written in a second language, if applicable.
i.     If the Contractor's final decision is appealed, all supporting
       documentation must be received by AHCCCSA, Office of Grievance and
       Appeals no later than five working days from the date the Contractor
       receives the appeal or from the date of the oral or written request from
       AHCCCSA, Office of Grievance and Appeals.
       The appeal file must contain a cover letter that includes:
       1.     grievant's name
       2.     grievant's AHCCCS ID number
       3.     grievant's address
       4.     phone number (if available)
       5.     date of receipt of grievance and appeal
       6.     summary of the Contractor's actions undertaken to resolve the
              grievance and basis thereof
j.     The following material shall be included in the appeal file:
       1.     written request of the grievant asking for the appeal
<PAGE>

       2.     copies of the entire file which include the investigations and/or
              medical records; and the Contractor's grievance decision
       3.     other information used by the Contractor to resolve the grievance
              and that would be necessary to AHCCCSA to resolve the grievance.
k.     The Contractor may attempt to use alternative resolution procedures to
       resolve disputes presented to the Contractor verbally or in writing. If
       the Contractor elects to use an alternative resolution process, it must
       be administered and completed within 30 days from receipt of the dispute.
       If the matter is not resolved to the grievant's satisfaction within the
       30-day period, the dispute must then be adjudicated using the grievance
       standards contained above. However, the Contractor must render the
       written grievance decision within a maximum of 45 days from the date of
       the initial filing of the grievance or dispute unless a longer period was
       agreed to by the parties involved.
l.     For all disputes where an alternative resolution is proposed, the
       Contractor must inform the grievant of the Contractor's resolution and
       ask the grievant if the resolution is acceptable no later than 30 days
       from the date that the dispute is initially presented to the Contractor.
       If acknowledged as acceptable, the matter may be closed. If the member or

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS


The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any
findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the
imposition of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

PENDED ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 100 days of the
original processing data. A sanction of $5.00 each month will be imposed for
each encounter pended for more than 100 days unless the pend is due to AHCCCSA
error. "AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter which (1) AHCCCSA
acknowledges to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the
system programming, an update to the database reference table, or further
research by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that the resolution of a pended
encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will respond in
writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA response
will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the
total number of encounters pended more than 100 days and the number of such
encounters not subject to sanction because of AHCCCSA error.

ENCOUNTER VALIDATION STUDIES

Per HCFA requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data. Any and
all covered services may be validated as part of these studies. Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.

The following reflects AHCCCSA's encounter validation study process and sanction
policy as of 10/1/97. AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and
sanction amounts based on agency review or as a result of consultations with
HCFA. The Contractor will be notified in writing of any significant change in
study methodology.

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to


<PAGE>
AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records requests, the Contractor's failure to
provide AHCCCSA with the records requested within 90 days may result in a
sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If AHCCCSA does not receive a
sufficient number of medical records from the Contractor to select a
statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor may be sanctioned up to
5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

         Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date
         that the encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be
         received by AHCCCSA no later than 240 days after the end of the month
         in which the service was rendered, or the effective date of enrollment
         with the Contractor, whichever is later. For all encounters for which
         timeliness is evaluated, a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to
         the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter record is
         received by AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date determined above.
         It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per error
         extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
         may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has
         changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will
         be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the
         time the studies begin. Timeliness will be evaluated through
         retrospective encounter validation studies for contract years through
         10/95-9/96, inclusive. Pending HCFA approval, for contract years
         10/97-9/98 and after, timeliness will be evaluated concurrently as
         encounters are received based on the difference between the receipt
         date at AHCCCS and the date of service.

         Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate
         description of AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction
         per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
         assessed if the encounter is incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is
         anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per error
         extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
         may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has
         changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will
         be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the
         time the studies begin.

         Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
         inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or
         historical files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A"
         and for Study "B", a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the
         population of encounters may be assessed for an omission. It is
         anticipated that the sanction amount will be $5.00 per error
         extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and $10.00
         per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "B";
         however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that
         encounter quality has changed, or if HCFA changes sanction
         requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in
         effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account


<PAGE>
for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence interval shows the range
within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If error rates are based on
a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes will be the lower limit of
the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to HCFA, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance pursuant to Article 8 of AHCCCS Rules.
Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's capitation payment.

ATTACHMENT J: NEW OFFEROR REVIEW GUIDE

This document contains interview guides and worksheets for use in evaluating the
existing infrastructure and potential readiness of new offerors to participate
in the AHCCCS program. There are separate guides and worksheets for each of four
review areas, as well as a final section for recording summary findings. Each
evaluator will complete the readiness review guides and worksheets pertaining to
his/her section of the review and assign a grade (A, B, or C). In assigning the
grade, evaluators will determine whether the organization:

a.       Demonstrates full readiness to meet AHCCCS program standards as of the
         time of the review (i.e., has in place a core health plan
         infrastructure, as well as specific components relevant to a mandatory
         Medicaid managed care program); OR

b.       Demonstrates the existence of a core health plan infrastructure, as
         well as: l) an understanding of what modifications will be required to
         modify its system to meet AHCCCS program standards and 2) a reasonable
         plan for making such modifications; OR

c.       Fails to demonstrate the existence of a core health plan infrastructure
         and/or an understanding of what modifications will be required to meet
         AHCCCS program standards.

REVIEWER PREPARATION ACTIVITIES: The chart at the back of this section contains
a summary of the interviews to be conducted on-site, as well as the documents to
be examined by reviewers. Prior to the review, the new offeror should be
contacted for purposes of arranging the necessary interviews and confirming
availability of the requested documents. Note that some documents may be
included in offeror proposals. To the extent these are available prior to the
site visit, reviewers will examine them beforehand. Reviewers also will examine
the CYE 98 AHCCCS RFP and the new offeror's full proposal, again assuming it is
available prior to the visit.

POST REVIEW ACTIVITIES: Following the completion of on-site activities,
reviewers should record findings in the summary section of the guide, being
certain to document fully the basis for any "C" grades awarded to a plan. The
individual functional area findings then should be used by the review team's
leader to make a final judgment and recommendation to AHCCCS with respect to the
readiness of the new offeror to meet all program standards at the start of the
next contract cycle, if awarded a contract.

                  Instructions: Obtain organization's implementation plan(s) for
                  preparing to participate in the AHCCCS program. Document
                  whether the identified major tasks are addressed within each
                  functional area and, if so, the expected completion date. Note
                  in comments section whether the workplan appears sufficiently
                  detailed, whether tasks are ordered appropriately, and whether
                  the timeline is both realistic and rapid enough to assure
                  readiness at the start of the next contract cycle. If no plan
                  exists for a particular functional area, or if all necessary
                  components already are in place, note this as well.

         the applicable Geographic Service Area (GSA) Minimum Network Standards,
         as outlined in Attachment B of this contract, by August 15, 1997.
         Furthermore, the Contractor must have in place a sufficient number of
         contracts with providers to ensure that all covered services, as
         described in Section D, paragraph 1 (Scope of Services) of this

         provider network that will be capable of serving the greater of your
         existing membership in a GSA or up to one quarter of the members in

         May 1997 members (see attached matrix of members to be covered by
         Network). Also attached is a matrix showing the contract awards by GSA,
         effective October 1, 1997.

         the selection of an alternative contractor, financial sanctions, an
         enrollment cap, or other penalties in accordance with R9-22-405 and
         R9-22-406.

         forecasts including income statement and balance sheet for each year of

         Contractor must submit a detailed plan to meet the AHCCCS performance
         bond requirements to the Office of Managed Care by June 30, 1997. All

         unencumbered equity, in the amount of $150 per non-SOBRA Family
         Planning Extension Services members enrolled, with no liens or
         obligations against it. Failure to meet this standard may result in an
         enrollment cap being imposed in any or all contracted GSA's.

6.       READINESS ASSESSMENT

         As discussed in Section D, paragraph 32 of this contract, AHCCCS may

         requirements. AHCCCS may enforce provisions of R9-22-405 and R9-22-406
         if Contractor does not satisfy Readiness Review requirements.

covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all PPC member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during prior period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation
described below. Contractors will not receive PPC capitation on newborns of
members who were enrolled at the time of delivery.


RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For the first year of the
contract, AHCCCSA will offer a reconciliation process for contractors whose
total PPC cost experience (i.e., for all capitation risk groups) is more than
10% higher than the reimbursement associated with PPC (capitation and
reinsurance). AHCCCSA will reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable
costs. AHCCCSA may also require all Contractors to complete a reconciliation
process and recoup from any Contractor, profit amounts in excess of a 10% limit.

AHCCCSA will develop a detailed reconciliation policy which will be distributed
for review and comment at a later date.

PROSPECTIVE CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for all
prospective member months, including partial member months. AHCCCSA will make
monthly capitation payments to the Contractor for each member enrolled with the
Contractor on the first of the month as payment in full for any and all covered
services provided to the member, Payment shall be made no later than the fifth
working day of the month for which payment is due. For members enrolled at any
time after the beginning of the month's payment cycle, capitation will be
prorated from the effective date of enrollment through the remainder of the
month of enrollment. These payments will be made by AHCCCS to Contractor on a
weekly basis.

SOBRA SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled SOBRA woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
SOBRA payment. SOBRA Supplemental payments will not apply to SOBRA women who
deliver in a prior period


                                       3
<PAGE>

coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time during the term of
this contract to adjust the amount of this SOBRA payment for women who deliver
at home. The Contractor is responsible for meeting the newborn notification
requirements defined in AHCCCS Rule R9-22-342 before this payment will be made
to the Contractor.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: In addition to the capitation payment described above, a
separate and additional payment will be made to the Contractor to help defray
costs for members receiving approved protease inhibitors and associated lab work
related to their treatment for HIV/AIDS. The list of AHCCCSA-approved protease
inhibitors is available in the Bidder's Library.

On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, an unduplicated monthly count of members, by rate code, who are using
approved protease inhibitors. The report shall be submitted, along with the
quarterly financial reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each
quarter. (A sample of this reporting form may be found in the Bidder's Library.)

The rate of reimbursement for this separate payment will $634.50 per month and
is subject to review during the term of the contract. Payment will be made
quarterly to the Contractor based on the reported eligible members for the
preceding quarter. AHCCCSA will review this HIV/AIDS-related data at least
annually as part of its Operational and Financial Review and reserves the right
to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members as determined through this
review as well as an associated penalty for incorrect reporting.

39.      REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program
provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered
inpatient facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical
condition beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503). Per diem rates
paid for nursing facility services, including room and board, provided in lieu
of hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall be eligible for
reinsurance coverage (see AHCCCS Rule R9-22-203 subsection B for excluded
services). Reinsurance for the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (See Section
D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement), will be paid in accordance with AHCCCS
Rule R9-22-503.

AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Prospective reinsurance coverage applies to prospective enrollment periods. The
deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS acute care
enrollment as of October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties,
as shown in the following table. These deductible levels are subject to change
by AHCCCSA during the term of this contract.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

If a Contractor's actual non-MN/MI deductible is $35,000 or $50,000, AHCCCSA
will increase the Contractor's capitation rate awarded by defined amounts for
each capitation risk group. These specific capitation adjustments are available
in the Bidder's Library.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: For the first two years of the contract
period, a separate reinsurance deductible and coinsurance percentage will apply
during prior period coverage. All Contractors, regardless of enrollment, will be
subject to a deductible level anticipated to be between $3,000 and $8,000. The
exact deductible level will be specified prior to award of contracts. The
coinsurance percentage for the prior period coverage reinsurance is 100%.
Expenses incurred during prior period coverage will not apply toward the
prospective reinsurance thresholds.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance benefits. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide
for a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used
in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.

The Contractor shall be subject to utilization and other reviews by AHCCCSA of
care provided to a member which results in a reinsurance claim as referenced in
R9-22-503 (G.3).

Medical review on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance cases will
be determined based on statistically valid random sampling . AHCCCSA, Office of
the Medical Director, will generate the sampling and will notify the Contractor
of documentation needed for the retrospective medical review process to occur at
the Contractor's offices. The results of the medical review sampling will be
separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and prior period coverage
reinsurance reimbursement populations of the Contractor. A recoupment of
reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor may occur based on the results
of the medical review sampling. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45
days advance notice of any on-site review. The Contractor shall have all
requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor representative shall be available to the
Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review activities. While
on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with work space, access to
a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for conferences. The Contractor will
be furnished a copy of the Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the
onsite review and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings.


                                       5
<PAGE>

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia and members who receive covered organ and tissue transplantation
including bone marrow, heart and other organ transplantation. For additional
detail and restrictions see AHCCCS Rule R9-22-202. There is no deductible for
catastrophic reinsurance cases and AHCCCS will reimburse the Contractor at 85%
of the Contractor's covered costs. All catastrophic claims will be subject to
medical review by AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When an eligible member is identified as being catastrophically
eligible by AHCCCSA due to a specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 286.0,
286.1, 286.2 and 286.4), all medically necessary covered services provided
during the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the
Contract's paid amount. Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDA VP responders
that are dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify
AHCCCS Office of the Medical Director Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis.
Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid for a maximum 30-day retroactive period
from the date of notification to AHCCCSA.

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts, kidney and cornea transplantation services are not
eligible for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the
regular (non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor-paid amount
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits.
However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for
submitting encounters for catastrophic reinsurance services. The initial claims
for reimbursement under the catastrophic reinsurance program must be filed no
later than June 30th of the year following the contract year. Catastrophic
reinsurance claims that are submitted within this time limit and are denied or
adjusted, may be corrected until September 30th of the year following the
contract year. All catastrophic reinsurance claims must be submitted in
accordance with the AHCCCS Reinsurance Policy/Procedure Manual.


 [FROM SECTION H, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS]

8.       BEST AND FINAL OFFERS

AHCCCSA reserves the right to accept any or all initial offers without further
negotiation and may choose not to request a best and final offer (BFO). Offerors
are therefore advised to submit their most competitive offers at the outset. If
it is considered in the best interest of the State, however, AHCCCSA may issue a
written request to all offerors for a best and final offer in a particular
geographic service area or areas. The purpose of a BFO request is to allow
offerors an opportunity to resubmit bids for rate codes not previously accepted
by AHCCCSA. This request will notify them of the date, time and place for the
submission of their offers. In addition,


                                       6
<PAGE>

AHCCCSA will disclose to each offeror which of its bid rates are acceptable
(within or below actuarial rate range), and which are not acceptable (above the
actuarial rate range). All offerors whose final bid rates fall below the bottom
of the actuarial rate range will have their rates increased to the bottom of
that rate range after the final BFO. If an offeror does not submit a notice of
withdrawal or a best and final offer, its immediate previous offer will be
considered its best and final offer.

All BFOs must be submitted on the computer disk provided by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA
will limit the number of BFO rounds if it is in the best interest of the State.
Offerors will be permitted, within the restrictions and limitations defined
below, to adjust upward a capitation rate for a rate code that was previously
accepted to offset the reduction of a capitation rate in another rate code in
the first BFO round only. These restrictions and limitations include, but are
not limited to:

a.       An offeror will be allowed to adjust upward a previously accepted rate
         code bid only during the first BFO round;

b.       The weighted amount of BFO increase cannot exceed the weighted amount
         of BFO reduction. AHCCCSA will furnish the Offeror the enrollment
         percentages, by rate code, by GSA, to be used in determining the
         weighted amount. Should the weighted amount of the adjustment exceed
         the weighted amount of the BFO reduction, AHCCCSA shall reject the
         first BFO and the adjustment (costing the Offeror the loss of the first
         BFO round in that GSA). Since a rate code can only be adjusted during
         the first BFO round, the Offeror will lose the opportunity to make an
         upward capitation adjustment to previously accepted rate code bids in
         that GSA.

         For example, assume that MN/MI was the rate code where a BFO was needed
         and the offeror reduced this rate by $10. PMPM. Also assume the MN/MI
         rate code accounted for 9% of the members in the GSA.

         Weighted Average Capitation Reduction - 9% X $10.00 = $.90

         Assume the rate code adjusted upward was TANF and this rate code was
         increased by $2.00 PMPM. Also assume this rate code accounted for 50%
         of the members in the GSA.

         Weighted Average Capitation Increase - 50% X $2.00 =$1.00

         Therefore, the BFO would be rejected because the weighted amount of the
         BFO adjustment exceeded the weighted amount of the BFO reduction.

c.       Contractors will not be allowed to decrease a bid in a BFO round if the
         initial bid was below the bottom of the rate range. If such a BFO is
         submitted it will be rejected.

d.       If an adjustment during the initial BFO round causes the Offeror to
         exceed the upper range of any rate code, AHCCCSA will reject the
         adjustment and return the (adjusted)


                                       7
<PAGE>

         rate code to the initial capitation rate bid by the Offeror. Since a
         previously accepted rate code bid can only be adjusted during the first
         BFO round, the Offeror will lose the opportunity to make an upward
         capitation adjustment for this rate code.

e.       AHCCCSA reserves the sole right to accept or reject any adjustment. The
         Offeror by submitting an adjustment to a rate code is requesting
         approval by AHCCCSA; such approval shall not be automatic. If an
         initial bid is below the bottom of a rate range, it cannot be adjusted
         downward by the Offeror in a BFO round.

Capitation Rates Offered after the BFOs: As stated above AHCCCSA may limit the
number of BFO rounds. After the final BFO round is complete, provided it is in
the best interest of the state, AHCCCSA will cease issuing BFO requests. At this
point, should the Offeror have a rate code(s) without an accepted capitation
rate, AHCCCSA shall offer a capitation rate to the Offeror. The capitation rate
offered shall be somewhere in the bottom half of the rate range (specific
placement to be determined by AHCCCSA and its actuaries). Note that all rates
offered in this manner shall be identical for all offerors in the same GSA and
rate code.


[FROM SECTION I, EVALUATION FACTORS:]

2.       CAPITATION

The Offeror shall submit initial capitation bids by rate code grouping within a
geographic service area. These initial bids will be evaluated and scored. The
lowest bid within each geographic service area and rate code grouping will
receive the maximum allowable points. If a bid is below the actuarial rate
range, the bid will be evaluated as if it were at the bottom of the actuarial
rate range. No additional points will be given for bids below the actuarial rate
range. Conversely, the highest bid (within or above the actuarial rate range)
will receive the least number of points.

If AHCCCSA requests best and final offers, these will be scored using the same
methodology as was used to score the initial bids. The initial bid will be
weighted 20% and the final bid will be weighted 80% for scoring. Offerors should
note that AHCCCSA may not offer the opportunity to submit best and final offers.

                         SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS


1.       SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22-202 et seq., the AHCCCS Medical Policy
Manual, the AHCCCS Behavioral Health Policy Manual, and the document entitled
"AHCCCS Health Plan Performance Indicators", all of which are incorporated
herein by reference and may be found in the Bidder's Library. The covered
services are briefly described below. Covered services must be medically
necessary and provided by, or coordinated with, a primary care provider, except
for behavioral health and children's preventive dental services. Services must
be rendered by providers that are appropriately licensed, operating within their
scope of practice, and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall
provide the same standard of care for all members regardless of the member
eligibility category.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997: This revision of the AHCCCS acute care contract is
believed to contain all of the new requirements mandated by the federal Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. The Contractor, however, shall be held liable for all
mandated requirements whether or not they appear in this renewal amendment.

KIDSCARE COVERED SERVICES: KidsCare members are eligible for the same services

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a free-standing surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through other than medical or surgical means
(i.e. hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D), Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services. For state-only
members (MN/MI, EAC, ELIC) reimbursement for behavioral health services will not
exceed the first three days per episode of emergency/ crisis stabilization, not
to exceed 12 days per contract year. See also the AMPM and the AHCCCS Behavioral
Health Policy Manual for details on covered behavioral health services.

CHILDREN'S REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for CRS-covered conditions
is administered by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) for children
who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor is responsible for referring
children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for these services.
Eligibility criteria and the referral process are described in the CRS Policy
and Procedures Manual available in the Bidder's Library. The Contractor is also
responsible for providing primary medical care, including emergency services and
initial care of newborn infants, for members who are also CRS eligible, and to
require the member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) to coordinate their care with
the CRS program. All services provided must be included in the member's medical
record maintained by the PCP.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
Title XIX members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved
by the Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition.
Chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to limitations specified in
CFR 410.22, for dually qualified Medicare beneficiaries if prescribed by the
member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

DENTAL: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services; dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the AHCCCS periodicity
schedule; therapeutic dental services; dentures; and pre-transplantation dental
services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance with the EPSDT periodicity
schedule for dental screening services and ensure that dental service reports
are included in the member's medical record maintained by the PCP. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Measures. The Contractor shall
ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the member
has not been scheduled for a visit. If no response is received, a second notice
must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may request dental services without
referral from their PCP and may choose a dental provider from the Contractor's
provider network. Members 21 years of age and older are eligible for emergency
dental services, medically necessary dentures and pre-transplantation dental
services only. Dental standards may


                                       14

<PAGE>


be found in the AMPM which is incorporated herein by reference and which may be
found in the Bidder's Library.

DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease
(ESRD) providers. Services may be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an
inpatient basis if the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic
dialysis services.

EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT (EPSDT): The Contractor
shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment for members
under age 21. The Contractor shall ensure that these members receive required
health screenings, including developmental/behavioral health, in compliance with
the AHCCCS periodicity schedule (included herein as Attachment K) and to submit
to the AHCCCS Office of the Medical Director/Acute Care Unit, all EPSDT reports
as required by AHCCCS medical policy. For Title XIX members under age 21,
chiropractic services shall be covered. The Contractor is required to meet
specific participation/utilization rates for members as described in Section D,
Paragraph 16, Performance Measures. Because the behavioral health benefit for
Title XIX and Title XXI members age 0-17 is provided through the ADHS/RBHA
system, the Contractor shall ensure the initiation and coordination of the
referral of these members to the RBHA. Referrals for behavioral health services
for Title XIX 18-, 19- and 20-year olds and Title XXI 18-year-old non-SMIs
shall be the responsibility of the Contractor's Behavioral Health Coordinator.

Title XXI members are not entitled to the all-encompassing EPSDT service package
required for Title XIX children. Title XXI children are entitled only to the
EPSDT and other covered services specified in this document and the Title XXI
State Plan.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

a.       Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
         professionals to provide pre-hospital, emergency care on a
         24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
         emergent condition as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-101 and R9-31-101.
         Emergency medical services are covered without prior authorization. The
         Contractor is encouraged to contract with emergency service facilities
         for the provision of emergency services. The Contractor is encouraged
         to contract with or employ the services of non-emergency facilities
         (e.g. urgent care centers) to address member non-emergency care issues
         occurring after regular office hours or on weekends. The Contractor
         shall be responsible for educating members and providers regarding
         appropriate utilization of emergency room services. The Contractor
         shall monitor emergency services utilization (by both provider and
         member) and shall have guidelines for implementing corrective action
         for inappropriate utilization. For utilization review, the test for
         appropriateness of the request for emergency services shall be whether
         a prudent layperson, similarly situated, would have requested such
         services. For purposes of this contract, a "prudent layperson" is
         defined as a person without medical training who exercises those
         qualities of attention, knowledge, intelligence and judgment which


                                       15

<PAGE>


         society requires of its members for the protection of their own
         interest and the interests of others. The phrase does not apply to a
         person's ability to reason, but rather the prudence with which he acts
         under a given set of circumstances.

b.       All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition

c.       Emergency transportation

d.       Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
         assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent
         situations, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

e.       The Contractor shall comply with established guidelines regarding the
         coordination of post-stabilization care.

EYE EXAMINATIONS/ OPTOMETRY: The Contractor shall provide all medically
necessary emergency eye care, vision examinations, prescriptive lenses, and
treatments for conditions of the eye for all members under the age of 21, with
the exception of KidsCare members. See limitations for KidsCare members
described at the beginning of this section, titled "KidsCare Covered Services."
For members who are 21 years of age and older, the Contractor shall provide
emergency care for eye conditions which meet the definition of an emergency
medical condition, cataract removal, and/or medically necessary vision
examinations and prescriptive lenses if required following cataract removal and
other eye conditions as specified in the AMPM.

FAMILY PLANNING: The Contractor shall provide family planning services for all
members who choose to delay or prevent pregnancy, including medical, surgical,
pharmacological and laboratory services, as well as contraceptive devices,
information and counseling necessary to allow the members to make informed
decisions regarding family planning methods. If the Contractor does not provide
family planning services, it must contract for these services through another
health care delivery system which allows members freedom of choice in selecting
a provider. A prospective offeror may discuss arrangements for family planning
services only with other prospective offerors during the RFP process for the
purpose of making arrangements for the provision of family planning services.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family Planning
Services Extension Program, a program that provides only family planning
services for a maximum of 24 months to women whose SOBRA eligibility has
terminated. The Contractor is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a
SOBRA woman is sterilized to prevent inappropriate enrollment in the SOBRA
Family Planning Services Extension Program. Notification may be made at the time
the newborn is reported or after the sterilization procedure is completed.

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND SCREENING: The Contractor shall provide these
services for non-hospitalized members 21 years of age and older. These services
include, but are not limited to, screening for hypertension, elevated
cholesterol, colon cancer, sexually-transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and
HIV/AIDS; mammograms and prostate screenings; physical examinations and
diagnostic work-ups; and immunizations. Assessment and screening services for
members under age 21 are based on the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule.

HOME HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide these services when members require
part-time or intermittent care but do not require hospital care under the daily
direction of a physician to


                                       16

<PAGE>



prevent re-hospitalization or institutionalization and may include skilled
nursing, therapies, supplies and home health aide services.

HOSPICE: These services are covered for members under 21 years of age who are
certified by a physician as being terminally ill and having six months or less
to live. See the AMPM for details on covered hospice services.

HOSPITAL: Inpatient services include semi-private accommodations for routine
care, intensive and coronary care, surgical care, obstetrics and newborn
nurseries, and behavioral health emergency/ crisis stabilization. If the
member's medical condition requires isolation, private inpatient accommodations
are covered. Nursing services, dietary services and ancillary services such as
laboratory, radiology, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, blood and blood
derivatives, etc. are also covered. Outpatient services include any of the above
services which may be provided on an outpatient or ambulatory basis (i.e.
laboratory, radiology, therapies, ambulatory surgery, etc.). Observation
services may be provided on an outpatient basis for up to 24 hours if determined
reasonable and necessary to decide whether the member should be admitted for
inpatient care. Observation services include the use of a bed and periodic
monitoring by hospital nursing staff and/or other staff to evaluate, stabilize
or treat medical conditions of a significant degree of instability and/or
disability.

IMMUNIZATIONS: The Contractor shall provide immunizations for adults (21 years
of age and older) to include diphtheria-tetanus, influenza, pneumococcus,
rubella, measles and hepatitis-B. For all members under the age of 21,
immunization requirements include diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine (DPT),
oral polio vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), H. influenza, type B
(HIB), hepatitis B (Hep B), combined 3-antigen rate (4 DPT, 3 OPV, 1 MMR) and
varicella vaccine. The Contractor is required to meet specific immunization
rates for members under the age of 21 which are described in Section D,
Paragraph 16, Performance Measures.

INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE: Effective October 1,1998, the Contractor shall not
reimburse IHS or a tribal facility for Title XIX, Title XXI or state-only
covered services, including emergency services, provided in the IHS facility or
tribal facility to Native American members enrolled with the Contractor. Subject
to approval from HCFA, AHCCCSA will allow IHS or the tribal facility to submit
Title XIX claims for such services directly to AHCCCSA. Details of the claims
and payment process will be determined after HCFA approval. At its option, the
Contractor may choose to subcontract with and pay an IHS facility or tribal
facility for covered services provided to members.

LABORATORY: Laboratory services for diagnostic, screening and monitoring
purposes are covered when ordered by the member's PCP, other attending physician
or dentist, and provided by a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act)
approved hospital, clinic, physician office or other health care facility
laboratory.

MATERNITY: The Contractor shall provide pre-conception counseling, pregnancy
identification, prenatal care, treatment of pregnancy related conditions, labor
and delivery services, and postpartum care for members. Services may be provided
by physicians, physician assistants or


                                       17

<PAGE>



nurse practitioners certified in midwifery. Members may select or be assigned to
a PCP specializing in obstetrics. Circumcisions are covered if performed during
the newborn's hospital stay after birth, or on an outpatient basis within one
month of the infant's hospital discharge. Title XIX and state-only members
anticipated to have a low-risk delivery may elect to receive labor and delivery
services in their home from their maternity provider if this setting is included
in allowable settings for the Contractor, and the Contractor has providers in
its network that offer home labor and delivery services. Title XIX and
state-only members anticipated to have a low-risk prenatal course and delivery
may elect to receive maternity services of prenatal care, labor and delivery and
postpartum care provided by licensed midwives if they are in the Contractor's
provider network. All licensed midwife labor and delivery services must be
provided in the member's home since licensed midwives do not have admitting
privileges in hospitals or AHCCCS registered free-standing birthing centers.
Members receiving maternity services from a licensed midwife must also be
assigned to a PCP for other health care and medical services. Home delivery and
licensed midwives are not covered for Title XXI members.

The Contractor shall allow women and their newborns to receive up to 48 hours of
inpatient hospital care after a routine vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours of
inpatient care after a cesarean delivery. The attending health care provider, in
consultation with the mother, may discharge the mother or newborn prior to the
48-hour minimum length of stay. A normal newborn may be granted an extended stay
in the hospital of birth when the mother's continued stay in the hospital is
beyond the 48 or 96 hour stay.

MEDICALLY-NECESSARY ABORTIONS: These services are covered when the pregnancy
would endanger the life of the mother if the fetus were to be carried to term
and, for Title XIX and Title XXI members, if the pregnancy is the result of rape
or incest. Providers must document and submit to the Contractor a Certificate of
Medical Necessity for Pregnancy Termination and prior authorization is required.
If the procedure is performed on an emergency basis, documentation must be
submitted to the Contractor within two working days. Additional documentation,
outlined in the AMPM, is required for members under 18 years of age who seek
medically necessary abortion due to rape or incest.

MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME), ORTHODIC AND PROSTHETIC
DEVICES: These services are covered when prescribed by the member's PCP, other
attending physician or practitioner, or by a dentist. Medical equipment may be
rented or purchased only if other sources are not available which provide the
items at no cost. The total cost of the rental must not exceed the purchase
price of the item. Reasonable repairs or adjustments of purchased equipment are
covered to make the equipment serviceable and/or when the repair cost is less
than renting or purchasing another unit.

NURSING FACILITY: The Contractor shall provide nursing facility services,
including Christian Science sanatoria, for members who require short-term
convalescent care not to exceed 90 days per contract year. Services must be
provided in a dually-certified Medicare/Medicaid facility which includes in the
per-diem rate: nursing services, basic patient care equipment and sickroom
supplies, dietary services, administrative physician visits, non-customized DME,
necessary maintenance rehabilitation therapies, over-the-counter medications,
social, recreational and spiritual activities, and administrative, operational
medical direction services. The Contractor


                                       18
<PAGE>



shall continue medically necessary nursing facility services for any member who
has not been determined ALTCS eligible but is currently residing in a nursing
facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If the
member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program Contractor
before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility coverage, the
Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage during the time the
member is enrolled with the Contractor.

NUTRITION: The Contractor shall provide nutritional assessment and nutritional
supplements including oral supplements for EPSDT members when medically
necessary. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is covered for all members when it
is the sole source of nutrition due to severe pathology of the alimentary tract.
TPN may also be used to supplement nutrition for EPSDT members when medically
necessary but need not be the member's sole source of nutrition.

PHYSICIAN: The Contractor shall provide physician services to include medical
assessment, treatments and surgical services provided by licensed allopathic or
osteopathic physicians.

PODIATRY: The Contractor shall provide podiatry services to include
bunionectomies, casting for the purpose of constructing or accommodating
orthotics, medically necessary orthopedic shoes that are an integral part of a
brace, and medically necessary routine foot care for patients with a severe
systemic disease which prohibits care by a nonprofessional person.

PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND PHARMACY: Medications ordered by a PCP, attending
physician or dentist and dispensed under the direction of a licensed pharmacist
are covered subject to limitations related to prescription supply amounts,
Contractor formularies and prior authorization requirements, as well as
restrictions for immunosuppressant drugs addressed in AHCCCS medical policies
for transplantations. Over-the-counter medication may be prescribed when it is
determined to be a lower-cost alternative to prescription medication.

PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (PCP): PCP services are covered when provided by a
physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner selected by, or assigned
to, the member. The PCP provides primary health care and serves as a gate-keeper
and coordinator in referring the member for specialty medical services,
behavioral health and dental services. The PCP is responsible for maintaining
the member's primary medical record which contains documentation of all health
risk assessments and health care services, including those provided by the PCP
and through referral.

RADIOLOGY AND MEDICAL IMAGING: These services are covered when ordered by the
member's PCP, attending physician or dentist and are provided for diagnosis,
prevention, treatment or assessment of a medical condition. Services are
generally provided in hospitals, clinics, physician offices and other health
care facilities.

REHABILITATION THERAPY: The Contractor shall provide occupational, physical and
speech therapies. Therapies must be prescribed by the member's PCP or attending
physician for an acute condition and the member must have the potential for
improvement due to the rehabilitation. Occupational and speech therapies are
only covered on an inpatient basis for those 21 and over, physical therapy for
all members and occupational and speech therapies for members under the


                                       19

maintenance regimen.

RESPIRATORY THERAPY: This therapy is covered on an inpatient or outpatient basis
when prescribed by the member's PCP or attending physician and is necessary to
restore, maintain or improve respiratory functioning.

TRANSPLANTATION OF ORGANS AND TISSUE, AND RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS: These
services include bone marrow, heart, lung, heart-lung, kidney, liver, and cornea
transplantations (all with related immunosuppressant medications), and are
covered within limitations defined in the AMPM for members diagnosed with
specified medical conditions. Kidney-pancreas transplants are covered for Title
XXI members only. Such limitations include whether the stage of the disease is
such that the transplant can affect the outcome; the member has no other
conditions which substantially reduce the potential for successful
transplantation; and whether the member will be able to comply with necessary
and required regimens of treatment. Bone grafts are also covered under this
service. Services include: pre-transplant inpatient or outpatient evaluation;
donor search; organ/tissue harvesting or procurement; preparation and
transplantation services; and convalescent care. In addition, if a member
receives a transplant covered by a source other than AHCCCS, medically necessary
non-experimental services are provided within limitations after the discharge
from the acute care hospitalization for the transplantation. AHCCCS has
contracted with transplantation providers for the Contractor's use or the
Contractor may select its own transplantation provider. However, the quality of
services must be equal to or exceed those from the AHCCCS provider and the rate
paid can not exceed the AHCCCS provider's negotiated rate. Transplantations for
the MN/MI population are subject to available funding.

TRANSPORTATION: These services include emergency and non-emergency medically
necessary transportation. Emergency transportation, including transportation
initiated by an emergency response system such as 911, may be provided by
ground, air or water ambulance to manage an AHCCCS member's emergency medical
condition at an emergency scene and transport the member to the nearest
appropriate medical facility. In an emergency, the member shall be taken to the
nearest appropriate emergency facility. Non-emergency transportation shall be
provided for Title XIX and state-only members who are unable to provide their
own transportation for medically necessary services. Title XXI members are not
eligible for non-emergency transportation services except for transfers between
facilities.

TRIAGE/SCREENING AND EVALUATION: These are covered services when provided by
acute care hospitals, IHS facilities and urgent care centers to determine
whether or not an emergency exists, assess the severity of the member's medical
condition and determine services necessary to alleviate or stabilize the
emergent condition. The provider must notify the Contractor within 12 hours of
the member's registration with the facility for emergency services. Supporting
documentation for services rendered must be provided when reporting or billing a
service. Triage/screening services must be reasonable, cost effective and meet
the criteria for severity of illness and intensity of service.

2.       BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES

The Contractor must provide developmental/behavioral health screenings as part
of the EPSDT program for Title XIX and Title XXI members under 21 years of age.
The Contractor is responsible for the provision of Title XIX covered behavioral
health services to members as described below:

TITLE XIX MEMBERS (TANF, SSI, SOBRA):

referring Title XIX eligible, children age 0-17, adults age 21 and older, and
SMI members age 18 and older to the Regional Behavioral Health Authorities
(RBHAs) for the provision of Title XIX covered behavioral health services. (The
RBHAs may, in turn, contract with local providers.) The Contractor is
responsible for ensuring that a medical record is established by the PCP when
information is received about an assigned member even if the PCP has not yet
seen the assigned member. The Contractor shall also communicate information
pertaining to ADHS enrolled members to the ADHS RBHAs including, but not limited
to, current diagnosis, medication, pertinent laboratory results, last PCP visit,
and last hospitalization. For prior period coverage, the Contractor is
responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary covered behavioral
health services to eligible persons not enrolled with ADHS.

NON-SMI, AGE 18, 19 AND 20: The Contractor is responsible for providing Title
XIX covered behavioral health services to Title XIX eligible non-SMI members age
18, 19 and 20 in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1204 and the AHCCCS

         directly for the provision of behavioral health services by the PCP,
         family members, self-referrals, schools, other service providers, and
         members of the community and State agencies as well as the Contractor's
         staff. The Contractor is responsible for identifying 18, 19 and 20 year
         old members who may meet the ADHS definition for Serious Mental Illness
         (SMI) and to refer these members to the RBHA for evaluation. The
         Contractor shall be responsible for all costs associated with
         conducting SMI evaluations in cases where a Title XIX 18, 19 or 20 year
         old member is determined by the R.BHA or their subcontractor not to
         meet the ADHS definition for SMI.

         SERVICE PLAN: The Contractor is responsible for developing a Service
         Plan for each Title XIX eligible non-SMI member age 18, 19 and 20
         requiring behavioral health services.


                                       21
<PAGE>

         Service Plans shall be developed within two weeks of assessment and
         services shall be authorized and initiated within 30 days from
         completion of the screening. The Service Plan is to be included as part
         of the member's medical record.

         CASE MANAGEMENT, CASE COORDINATION: The Contractor is responsible for
         providing case management services, when medically necessary. Case
         management services may vary in scope and frequency, depending on the
         eligible person's intensity of need. Case management services consist
         of a set of services and activities through which appropriate and
         cost-effective Title XIX covered services are identified, planned,
         coordinated, obtained, monitored and continuously evaluated. Case
         coordination is provided to Title XIX non-SMI members age 18, 19 and 20
         who are in need of behavioral health services but who do not require
         case management services which are more intensive. Case coordination is
         limited to Service Plan development, identification of service
         providers, monitoring, updates and follow-up, when necessary.

         QUALITY MANAGEMENT/UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT (QM/UM) REQUIREMENTS:
         Quality management QM/UM for behavioral health services must be
         integrated into the Contractor's QM/UM plans and must meet the QM/UM
         requirements established by AHCCCSA.

         PROVIDER NETWORK: The Contractor is responsible for contracting with
         behavioral health providers who meet ADHS licensure and/or
         certification standards and who are registered as a behavioral health
         provider with AHCCCSA. The Contractor may, at its option, contract with
         RBHAs for the provision of behavioral health services. The Contractor
         must ensure that a sufficient number of qualified behavioral health
         providers are in their provider network and that providers comply with
         subcontracting, appointment standards and other provider related
         requirements in this document.

         NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor is responsible for notifying
         AHCCCSA monthly of 18-, 19- and 20-year-old Title XIX, non-SMI members
         referred and receiving behavioral health services. The information is
         to be submitted to the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care using the
         reporting format developed by AHCCCSA and available in the Bidder's
         Library.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE) MEMBERS

On and after the effective date of enrollment, the Contractor is responsible for
up to the first three days of emergency behavioral health services provided to
Title XXI members not enrolled with ADHS. The Contractor shall immediately refer
members receiving emergency behavioral health services to the RBHA when it is
determined that the member may be eligible for ADHS enrollment. The Contractor
is also responsible for referring Title XXI eligible children age 0-17 (SMI and
non-SMI) and 18-year-old SMI members to the Regional Behavioral Health
Authorities (RBHAs) for the provision of Title XXI covered behavioral health
services. (The RBHAs may, in turn, contract with local providers.) The
Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical record is established by
the PCP when information is received about an assigned member even if the PCP
has not yet seen the assigned member. The Contractor shall also


                                       22
<PAGE>

communicate information pertaining to ADHS enrolled members to the ADHS RBHAs
including, but not limited to, current diagnosis, medication, pertinent

         regulation and diagnosis
m.       Emergency transportation
n.       Case management

Title XXI covered services are subject to the following limitations per contract

under this contract are monitored and counted against the applicable annual
limitations below:

a.       Inpatient behavioral health services provided in an inpatient hospital
         or inpatient psychiatric facility for persons under 21 years of age are
         limited to 30 days per contract year. Inpatient substance abuse
         services when combined with inpatient behavioral health services shall
         not exceed 30 days per contract year.

b.       If basic or intensive partial care is provided, each half-day of
         partial care shall equal one-fourth of an inpatient day and each full
         day of partial care shall equal one-half of an inpatient day.

c.       The following outpatient behavioral health services are limited to a
         total of 30 visits per contract year: behavior management, emergency
         crisis services, evaluation and diagnosis, group and/or family therapy
         and counseling, individual therapy and counseling and psychosocial
         rehabilitation.

         limitation.


                                       23
<PAGE>

f.       The following outpatient services are to be provided as medically
         necessary with no annual service limitation: Emergency transportation,
         case management, psychotropic medication, psychotropic medication
         monitoring, and laboratory and radiology services for psychotropic
         medication regulation and diagnosis.

g.       Bed hold days are not covered under the Title XXI program.

STATE-ONLY MEMBERS (MN/MI, EAC, ELIC):

For state-only members (MN/MI, EAC, ELIC) reimbursement for behavioral health
services will not exceed the first three days per episode of emergency/crisis
stabilization, not to exceed 12 days per contract year. This limitation of the
Contractor's financial liability is the same regardless of whether the member is
enrolled with a RBHA.

3.       AHCCCS MEDICAL POLICY MANUAL

The AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM) is hereby incorporated by reference into
this contract. AHCCCSA will provide three copies of the AMPM to the Contractor
(for use by the CEO, Medical Director and Quality Management staff). Updates to
medical policies will be distributed quarterly. The Contractor is responsible
for maintaining the AMPM with these updates and for complying with the
requirements set forth therein.

4.       VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of the Social
Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program which became
effective 10/1/94. Through this program the federal and state governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. Therefore, the Contractor shall not utilize AHCCCS
funding to purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19. Any provider
licensed by the State to administer immunizations may register with ADHS as a
"VFC provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall comply with all
VFC requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if providing
immunizations to AHCCCS members under the age of 19, the providers are
registered with ADHS/VFC.

5.       DENIALS OR REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES

When a covered service is denied, reduced, suspended or terminated, the
Contractor shall comply with the notice and continuation of benefits
requirements specified in 42 CFR 431.200 et seq., AAC R9-22, Article 13
outlining members' rights and responsibilities, and AHCCCS policy.

6.       ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll members. The
Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any reason unless directed to do
so by AHCCCSA. Eligibility for the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined
by one of the following agencies:


                                       24
<PAGE>

Social Security Administration          (SSA) SSA determines eligibility for the

                                        Emergency Services program (FES) related
                                        to the TANF, 1931 Group, or SOBRA
                                        programs.

AHCCCSA                                 AHCCCSA determines eligibility for the
                                        SSI/MAO groups, including the FES
                                        program related to the SSI-Cash program
                                        (aged, disabled, blind), the Arizona
                                        Long-Term Care System (ALTCS), the
                                        Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program,
                                        and the Title XXI program.

Arizona's 15 Counties                   Each county determines eligibility for
                                        the Medically Needy/Medically Indigent
                                        (MN/MI), Eligible Low Income Children
                                        (ELIC), and the State Emergency Services
                                        state programs.

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9-22-333, R9-22-334, R9-22-335, R9-22-337, R9-22-339,
R9-22-340, R9-22-342 and R9-22-707.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

All members except for those eligible under the MN/MI program have a choice of
available health plans. A listing of the available health plans and their
telephone numbers will be given to each member applicant during the application
process for AHCCCS benefits. Also included are instructions to member applicants
to call the health plans directly with specific questions concerning the health
plan. If there is only one health plan available for the member applicant's
Geographical Service Area, no choice is offered. Members who do not choose prior
to AHCCCSA's being notified of their eligibility are automatically assigned to a
health plan based on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm.


                                       25
<PAGE>

Title XXI members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned. When a member is transferred from
Title XIX to Title XXI and has not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the
member will remain with the Title XIX health plan and a choice notice will be
sent to the member. The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from
the date the choice notice is sent.

AHCCCSA assigns MN/MI members to an available health plan based on family
continuity or through AHCCCSA's auto-assignment algorithm. These members do not
get a choice of available contractors until their annual enrollment choice
period.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX and state-only members
include: Previously eligible and enrolled members who have been disenrolled for
less than 90 days will be automatically enrolled with the same contractor if
that contractor is still available. Also, women whose SOBRA eligibility has
terminated and have become enrolled in the Family Planning Services Extension
Program will automatically remain assigned to the same health plan. The Family
Planning Services Extension Program provides a maximum of 24 months of family
planning services.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX or state-only member with
the Contractor will generally be the day prior to the date the Contractor
receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily roster. However, the Contractor
is responsible for payment of medically necessary covered services retroactive
to the member's beginning date of eligibility, excluding any prior quarter
coverage period.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member will be the first day of
the month following notification to the health plan. If a Title XXI member is
determined eligible by the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled with
the health plan as of the 1st of the following month. If the member is
determined eligible AFTER the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled
with the health plan as of the 1st of the second following month.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for Title XIX and
state-only members. For Title XIX members, prior period coverage starts from the
first day of the month of application, or first eligible month. The Contractor
is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary covered
services provided to Title XIX members during prior period coverage. For
state-only members (MN/MI, ELIC) prior period coverage is generally limited to
the two days prior to the date of AHCCCSA being notified of eligibility.
However, prior period coverage could include additional days prior to the date
of enrollment. The Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for
medically necessary covered services provided on an emergency basis to
state-only members pursuant to ARS ss.36-2908 for the first two days of the
prior period coverage. Any additional prior period coverage for state-only
members will include all claims for medically necessary covered services. This
may include services provided prior to 10/1/97. (See Section D, Paragraph 37,
Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement from AHCCCSA
for this eligibility time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers, including Title XXI mothers,
who were enrolled at the time of the child's birth and whose newborn
notification was received by


                                       26
<PAGE>

AHCCCSA will be enrolled with the mother's health plan. The Contractor is
responsible for notifying AHCCCSA of a child's birth to an enrolled member.
Capitation to the Contractor will begin on the date notification is received by
AHCCCSA (except for cases of births during prior period coverage). The effective
date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the newborn's date of birth, and the
Contractor is responsible for all covered services to the newborn whether or
tint AHCCCSA has received notification of the child's birth. Note that AHCCCSA
is currently available to receive notification calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. Title XIX and Title XXI eligible mothers of newborns are sent a letter
advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for their child;
otherwise the child will remain with the mother's contractor. Newborns of MN/MI
mothers are enrolled with the mother's contractor for a minimum of 30 days up to
a maximum of 60 days. Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a health plan
and mothers of these newborns are sent a letter advising them of their right to
choose a different health plan for their child. AHCCCS Rules R9-22-342,
R9-22-707, R9-31-303 and R9-31-306 contain additional information concerning
newborn enrollment and payment.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, or as an Eligible Assistance Child (EAC), the member is guaranteed a
minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Upon initial capitated
enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of
12 full months of continuous enrollment. Enrollment guarantees do not apply to
Native Americans who choose to obtain their covered services through Indian
Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service basis or children enrolled with
Department of Economic Security/Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program. The
enrollment guarantee applies a maximum of one time per member per eligibility
category for Title XIX, Title XXI and EAC members. If a member changes from one
contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of
the guarantee period applies to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may
not be granted or may be terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor
child, is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22-337 and R9-31-307 describe other reasons
for which the enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans eligible under any coverage group other than
MN/MI, on or off-reservation, have a choice of Indian Health Services (IHS) or
any available contractor. If choice is not available or made within the
specified time limit, Native American Title XIX and state-only members living
on-reservation will be assigned to IHS and Native American Title XIX and
state-only members living off-reservation will be assigned to an available
contractor using AHCCCSA's family continuity policy and auto-assignment
algorithm. Native Americans may change from IHS or a PL 93-638 tribal entity to
a contractor or from a contractor to IHS or a PL 93-638 tribal entity at any
time. Native American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being
determined eligible.


7.       MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,

of its contract.

the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as allopathic or osteopathic
physicians who generally specialize in family practice, internal medicine,
obstetrics or pediatrics; certified nurse practitioners or certified nurse
midwifes; or physician's assistants.

At a minimum, the Contractor's number of full-time equivalent PCPs to enrolled
members shall not exceed a ratio of 1:1800 for adults and 1:1200 for children
who are 12 or younger. If the PCP contracts with more than one AHCCCS health

of AHCCCS members does not exceed the above ratio. The Contractor should
consider the PCP's total patient panel size (i.e. AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS



                                       41
<PAGE>

patients) when assessing the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS' appointment and other
standards. In addition, AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of the
PCP's panel of patients. The Contractor shall also reduce the number of members
assigned to its network PCPs as necessary to meet the appointment standards
specified in Section D, Paragraph 19, Appointment Standards. Any variation to
the above standards must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director
for prior approval. PCPs with assigned members diagnosed with AIDS or as
HIV-positive shall meet criteria and standards set forth in AHCCCS Medical
Policy and AHCCCS AIDS Advisory Committee Guidelines.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data regarding
PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign members with
complex medical conditions who are age 12 and younger to Board-certified
pediatricians.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice in selecting a PCP. When a new member has been assigned to the
Contractor, the Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment
and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's receipt of
notification of assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include with the
enrollment notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs and the
process for changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so. The
Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to the member. Members may
make both their initial PCP selection and any subsequent PCP changes either
verbally or in writing.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a.       Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member
b.       Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care
c.       Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member
d.       Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
         services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
         referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational
audits. PCPs and specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's
members shall have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one
general acute care hospital that is located within the Contractor's service
area.


23.      OTHER PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to:



                                       42
<PAGE>

a.       Recruit sufficient specialty physicians, dentists, health care
         professionals, health care institutions and support services to meet
         the medical needs of its members.
b.       Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
         network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of
         care to members with limited proficiency in English.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

For specialty services, the Contractor shall ensure that:

a.       PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services. Any
         waiver of this requirement by the Contractor must be approved in
         advance by AHCCCSA.
b.       Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a
         medical condition other than that for which the member was referred,
         unless approved by the member's PCP.
c.       The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP complete
         documentation of all diagnostic services including copies of test
         results if applicable, treatment services provided and the resulting
         outcome for each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers

a.       Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are
         general practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics
b.       Certified nurse midwives
c.       Licensed midwives.

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric care (physician
or certified nurse midwife). Such assignment shall be consistent with the
freedom of choice requirements for selecting health care professionals while
ensuring that the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a
PCP for medical care as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges. Licensed midwives perform deliveries only in the member's
home. Labor and delivery services may also be provided in the member's home by
physicians and certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.


                                       43

24.      NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient professional and
paramedical personnel for the provision of covered services, including emergency
medical care on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall
be sufficient to provide covered services within designated time and distance
limits. For Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that
95% of its members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and
Tucson do not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP or pharmacy. 95% of
its members residing outside the boundary area must not have to travel more than
10 miles to see such providers. See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements,
for details on network requirements by Geographic Service Area. Also see Section
D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for details on
changes in hospital subcontracting effective October 1, 1998.

Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall not discriminate
with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program, reimbursement or
indemnification against any provider based solely on the provider's type of
licensure or certification. This provision, however, does not prohibit the
Contractor from limiting provider participation to the extent necessary to meet
the needs of the Contractor's members. This provision also does not interfere
with measures established by the Contractor to control costs consistent with its
responsibilities under this contract.


25.      NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertain to all
service specifications described in the AMPM, Chapters 300, 600 and 900. In
addition, the Contractor shall have policies on how the Contractor will:

a.       Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program
         changes and requirements
b.       Monitor and control network compliance with policies and rules of
         AHCCCSA and the Contractor, including compliance with all policies and
         procedures related to the grievance process and ensuring the member's
         care is not compromised during the grievance process.
c.       Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network
d.       Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
         network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service
         area
e.       Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient providers
         to handle the volume of members
f.       Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring appointment
         procedures standards, appointment waiting times, and service provision
         standards


                                       44
<PAGE>

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract. The
Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned material changes in the
provider network before the change process has begun, for example before issuing
a 60-day termination notice to a provider. The notification shall be made within
one working day if the change is unexpected. AHCCCSA will assess proposed
changes in the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members'
health care and provide a written response to the Contractor within 14 days of
receipt of request. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care if the provider network change is likely to result in
deficient delivery of covered services.


26.      FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the federal mandates in OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. This
legislation gives FQHCs the option to require state Medicaid programs to
reimburse the FQHC at 100% of reasonable costs for the services delivered.
AHCCCSA and its contractors are required to comply with this legislation. The
following payment methodology for reasonable cost reimbursement was implemented
effective October 1, 1997.

If the FQHC elects reasonable cost reimbursement, the FQHC will receive a
quarterly payment per member per month from AHCCCSA. The initial capitation
amount will be $1.75 PMPM statewide. In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997, this additional reimbursement will be phased out over a five-year
period beginning in contract year ending 2000:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
CONTRACT YEAR        PHASE-OUT PERCENTAGE         PMPM AMOUNT
<S>                  <C>                          <C>
1997 through 1999        No phase-out                $ 1.75
2000                              95%                $ 1.66
2001                              90%                $ 1.58
2002                              85%                $ 1.49
2003                              70%                $ 1.23
2004                             100%                $ 0.00
</TABLE>

Contractors are required to submit member month information for Title XIX
members for each FQHC on a quarterly basis to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care.
Contractors should refer to the Office of Managed Care's policy on FQHC
reimbursement for further guidance. The following FQHCs are currently recognized
by HCFA:

Any other clinics that subsequently become FQHCs will be subject to the
reimbursement methodology described above upon electing reasonable cost
reimbursement from AHCCCSA.


27.      PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that each of its subcontractors register with
AHCCCSA as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID
Number. A Provider Participation Agreement must be signed with each provider who
does not already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be
forwarded to AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in
order for the Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled
members and for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

28.      PROVIDER AFFILIATION TAPE

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Tape User Manual on October 15, January 15, April 15, and
July 15 of each contract year. The Manual may be found in the Bidder's Library.


29.      PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its HCFA grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

a.       Timeliness: Reports or other required data shall be received on or
         before scheduled due dates.


                                       46
<PAGE>

b.       Accuracy: Reports or other required data shall be prepared in strict
         conformity with appropriate authoritative sources and/or AHCCCS defined
         standards.
c.       Completeness: All required information shall be fully disclosed in a
         manner that is both responsive and pertinent to report intent with no
         material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

30.      DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA, or the federal government, to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials which are produced by the Contractor and
refer to covered services shall state that such services are funded under
contract with AHCCCSA.

31.      REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.

32.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business for the initial contract year beginning 10/1/97.
The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess new contractors' readiness and
ability to provide contract services to members at the start of the contract
year. A new contractor will be permitted to commence operations only if the
Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's satisfaction.


                                       47
<PAGE>
33.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with HCFA requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular Operational
and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not limited to) ensuring
operational and financial program compliance. The Reviews will identify areas
where improvements can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and provide the
Contractor with technical assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply
with all other medical audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and
R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel as identified in advance shall be
available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
work space, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA or
any other nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the
entire NCQA report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and Financial Review
Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior to
AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review findings
may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements must be implemented by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to
determine the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations and
achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be conducted at any time
after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

34.      CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost-avoiding and paying claims in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-705, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. In the absence
of a subcontract provision to the contrary,


                                       48
<PAGE>


claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from the date of service or the
effective date of enrollment, whichever is later. Remittance advices
accompanying the Contractor's payments to providers must contain, at a minimum,
adequate descriptions of all denials and adjustments, the reasons for such
denials and adjustments, the amount billed, the amount paid, and grievance
rights. The Contractor's claims payment system, as well as its prior
authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize the likelihood of
having to recoup already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess of $50,000 per
provider within a contract year must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office
of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall ensure
that 90% of all clean claims are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean
claim and 99% are paid within 90 days of receipt of the clean claim.

During the term of this contact, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring all health plans
to use a standardized electronic format for electronic claims processing between
the plan and its providers. AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the
Technical Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by FFS providers and their billing agents who submit claims
electronically to AHCCCS. The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts will be supplemented
by a Form C layout All formats are subject to changes initiated by the
Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation. Reasonable implementation timeframes will be
negotiated with each plan.

35.      HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

Hospital subcontracts negotiated and/or renewed after October 1, 1998 shall not
contain any references to the AHCCCS tiered per-diem hospital rates.

MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES ONLY: The Arizona Laws of 1996 Chapter 288 Section 20
sets forth the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective
from October 1, 1997, through September 30, 2000. The Pilot as defined by AHCCCS
Rule R9-22-718 requires hospital subcontracts to be negotiated between health
plans in Maricopa and Pima counties and hospitals to establish reimbursement
levels, terms and conditions. Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor
and hospitals to cover operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims
submission and payment, payment of discounts or penalties, legal resolution,
which may, as an option, include establishing arbitration procedures. These
negotiated subcontracts shall remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to insure
availability of quality services within specific service districts, equity of
related party interests, reasonableness of rates, and only marketing of
contracted organizations. The general provisions of this program encompass acute
care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that result in an
admission. The Contractor shall submit all hospital subcontracts and any
amendments to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, for prior approval. For
non-emergency patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that at least 85% of its
members use contracted hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently
adjust the 85% standard. Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the number of
emergency days at a particular non-contracted hospital becomes significant,
AHCCCSA may require a subcontract at that hospital. Hospitals and health
plans/program contractors outside of Maricopa and Pima


                                       49
<PAGE>

counties are not included in this Pilot. Offerors should refer to the
"Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program Packet" for additional information and
requirements.

ALL GSA'S EXCEPT MARICOPA AND PIMA: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals for
member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain contracts with hospitals in all other GSA's and must submit
copies of these contracts to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, at least seven
days prior to the effective dates thereof.

FOR OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state
hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical reviews of all
hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously paid claims are subject to
recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack of medical necessity
through concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review, lack of medical
necessity identified during postpayment medical review shall not constitute a
basis for recoupment by the Contractor. See also Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims
Payment System. For a more complete description of the guidelines for hospital
reimbursement, please consult the Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and
rules.

36.      NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility
described above applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. To further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member
could be ALTCS eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that
occurs on the same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment The Contractor is responsible
for payment of services while the member is enrolled with the Contractor. The
Contractor is not responsible for the full 90 days of nursing facility coverage
if ALTCS enrollment occurs before the 90 days has ended.

37.      COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, SOBRA supplement, HIV-AIDS supplement,
reinsurance (PPC and prospective), and third party liability, as described and
defined within this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contact provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contact Payment must comply with requirements of ABS Title 36. AHCCCSA reserves
the option to
                           [INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]


                                       50
<PAGE>


make payments to the Contractor by wire or NACHA transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer nor indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, any
savings remaining to the Contractor as a result of favorable claims experience
and efficiencies in service delivery at the end of the contract term may be kept
by the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be separately
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund, as described in ARS ss.36-2913. An error discovered by the State with or
without an audit in the amount of fees paid to Contractor will be subject to
adjustment or repayment by Contractor making a corresponding decrease in a
current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment by AHCCCSA to
the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the Contractor. This
section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from making payment to a
fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required copayment from
members but service will not be denied for inability to pay the copayment.
Except for permitted copayments, the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not
bill or attempt to collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all PPC member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during prior period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation
described below. Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of
members who were enrolled at the time of delivery.

RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For CYE `98 and CYE `99, AHCCCSA
will offer a reconciliation process for contractors whose total PPC medical cost
experience (excluding administrative and non-operating expenses) is more than
10% higher than the reimbursement associated with PPC (PPC reinsurance and
"retro" portion of PPC capitation excluding administrative add-on). AHCCCSA will
reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable costs. AHCCCSA may also
require Contractors to provide documentation to support an audit of the PPC
medical expenses and a reconciliation to audited medical expenses. AHCCCS may
recoup from any Contractor, profit amounts in excess of a 10% limit. Refer to
the Office of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further details of
the reconciliation process.


                                       51
<PAGE>


PROSPECTIVE CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for all
prospective member months, including partial member months. AHCCCSA will make
monthly capitation payments to the Contractor for each member enrolled with the
Contractor on the first of the month as payment in full for any and all covered
services provided to the member. Payment shall be made no later than the fifth
working day of the month for which payment is due. For members enrolled at any
time after the beginning of the month's payment cycle, capitation will be
prorated from the effective date of enrollment through the remainder of the
month of enrollment. These payments will be made by AHCCCS to Contractor on a
weekly basis.

KIDSCARE CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for KidsCare members
in the same manner as prospective capitation (see above). KidsCare capitation
rates will be set by AHCCCSA in conjunction with an independent actuary.
Following CYE 99, AHCCCSA will review the assumptions made in setting the
capitation rates and may, at its option, reconcile and/or adjust the rates.

SOBRA SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled SOBRA woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
SOBRA payment. SOBRA Supplemental payments will not apply to SOBRA women who
deliver in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at
any time during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this SOBRA
payment for women who deliver at home. The Contractor is responsible for meeting
the newborn notification requirements defined in AHCCCS Rule R9-22-342,
R9-3l-309 and R9-31-707 before this payment will be made to the Contractor.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: In addition to the capitation payment described above, a
separate and additional payment will be made to the Contractor to help defray
costs for members receiving approved protease inhibitors and associated lab work
related to their treatment for HIV/AIDS. The list of AHCCCSA-approved protease
inhibitors is available in the Bidder's Library.

On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, an unduplicated monthly count of members, by rate code, who are using
approved protease inhibitors. The report shall be submitted, along with the
quarterly financial reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each
quarter.

The rate of reimbursement for this separate payment will $634.50 per month and
is subject to review during the term of the contract. Payment will be made
quarterly to the Contractor based on the reported members for the preceding
quarter. AHCCCSA will review this HIV/AIDS-related data at least annually as
part of its Operational and Financial Review and reserves the right to recoup
any amounts paid for ineligible members as determined through this review as
well as an associated penalty for incorrect reporting.

Refer to the Office of Managed Care's HIV/AIDS supplemental payment and review
policies for further details and requirements.

38.      CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect of a
program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is needed. In these
instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions discussed with the
Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The Contractor may request a
review of a program change if it believes the program change was not equitable;
AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

         a.       death of a member
         b.       member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits)
         c.       duplicate capitation to the same contractor

If a member is enrolled twice with the same contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39.      REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program
provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered
inpatient facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical
condition beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503 and R9-31-503). Per
diem rates paid for nursing facility services, including room and board,
provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall
be eligible for reinsurance coverage Refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program. Reinsurance
for the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (See Section D, Paragraph 35,
Hospital Reimbursement), will be paid in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503
and R9-31-503.

AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Prospective reinsurance coverage applies to prospective enrollment periods. The
deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS acute care
enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services as of October
1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown in the
following table. These deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during
the term of this contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

A Contractor whose enrollment qualifies for the $35,000 or $50,000 non-MN/MI
deductible level may, prior to the start of the contract period, elect one of
the lower deductible levels indicated in the above table. Contractors may not
elect to increase their deductible level. If a Contractor's actual non-MN/MI
deductible is $35,000 or $50,000, AHCCCSA will increase the Contractor's
capitation rate awarded by defined amounts for each capitation risk group. These
specific capitation adjustments are available from the Office of Managed Care.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: For CYE 98 and CYE 99, a separate reinsurance
deductible and coinsurance percentage will apply during prior period coverage.
As noted in the table above, all Contractors, regardless of enrollment, will be
subject to a $5,000 deductible level. The coinsurance percentage for the prior
period coverage reinsurance is 100%. Expenses incurred during prior period
coverage will not apply toward the prospective reinsurance thresholds.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance benefits. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide
for a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used
in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.

Effective October 1, 1998, when a member changes Contractors within a contract
year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs incurred for that
member will follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all
submitted encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of
service within the current contract year) will be applied toward the receiving
health plan's deductible level. For further details regarding this policy and
other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing
Manual.

Medical review on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance cases will
be determined based on statistically valid random sampling. AHCCCSA, Office of
the Medical Director, will generate the sampling and will notify the Contractor
of documentation needed for the retrospective medical review process to occur at
the Contractor's offices. Reinsurance consideration will be given to inpatient
facility contracts, and hearing decisions rendered by the Office of Grievance
and Appeals. Pre-hearing and/or hearing penalties discoverable during the review
process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance. A recoupment of reinsurance
reimbursements made to the Contractor will occur based on the results of the
medical review sampling. The results of the medical review sampling will be
separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and prior period coverage
reinsurance reimbursement populations in the review time frame for the
Contractor. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days advance notice of
any on-site review. The Contractor shall have all requested medical records
on-site. Any


                                       54
<PAGE>


documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall be made available upon
request of the Review Team during the course of the review. The Contractor
representative shall be available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA
on-site review activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the
Review Team with work space, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and
privacy for conferences. The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the
Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the onsite review and given an
opportunity to comment on any review findings.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia, von Willebrand's Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. This program
also covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and tissue
transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver and other
organ transplantation. For additional detail and restrictions refer to the
AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All catastrophic claims are
subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director, Reinsurance
Unit, of cases identified for catastrophic reinsurance coverage within 30 days
of (a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and (c) the
beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid for a
maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When a member is identified as being catastrophically eligible by
AHCCCSA due to the specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1,
286.2), all medically necessary covered services provided during the contract
year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders and
dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify AHCCCS
Office of the Medical Director Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis. All medically
necessary covered services provided during the contract year shall be eligible
for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy. Refer to the AMPM for additional details and restrictions.
All medically necessary covered services provided during the contract year shall
be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts, kidney and cornea transplantation services are not
eligible for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the
regular (non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM, Chapter 300
for covered services for organ and tissue transplants. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid


                                       55
<PAGE>


amount, whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be
found in the Bidder's Library. When a member is referred to a transplant
facility for an AHCCCS-covered organ transplant, the Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits.
However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for
submitting encounters for catastrophic reinsurance services. The initial claims
for reimbursement under the catastrophic reinsurance program must be filed no
later than June 30th of the year following the contract year. Catastrophic
reinsurance claims that are submitted within this time limit and are denied or
adjusted, may be corrected until September 30th of the year following the
contract year. All catastrophic reinsurance claims must be submitted in
accordance with the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

40.      COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/ THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and postpayment recovery. See Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare
Services and Cost Sharing.

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor's
network. The Contractor's liability for coinsurance and deductibles is limited
to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service pursuant to a
written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service rate, less any
amount paid by the third party. (The Contractor must decide whether it is more
cost-effective to provide the service within its network or pay coinsurance and
deductibles for a service outside its network. For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its network.) If the
Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer (other than
Medicare), and the insurer requires payment in advance of all copayments,
coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so. (See also Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
pre-natal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment


                                       56
<PAGE>


with the third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically
necessary transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits.
Further, if a service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that
its cost avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service
and that the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles
for use of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost avoid. The Contractor shall identify
all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except
in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the
following circumstances unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by
AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                  <C>
Uninsured/ underinsured motorist insurance           Adoption recovery
First and third-party liability insurance            Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors                                          Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery
</TABLE>

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002 and R9-31-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In
joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs. AHCCCSA's
authorized representative is also responsible for negotiating and acting in the
best interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases
and may compromise a settlement in order to maximize overall reimbursement, net
of legal and other costs. For total plan cases involving only payments from the
Contractor, the Contractor is responsible for performing all research,
investigation, the filing of liens and payment of lien filing fees and other
related costs.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a.       Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
         Contractor's financial liability for the member
b.       There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
         reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.)
c.       Such recovery is not prohibited by state or federal law

REPORTING: The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA's authorized
representative within five working days of the identification of a third-party
liability case with known reinsurance (often referred to as joint liability
cases). The Contractor shall communicate any known change in health insurance
information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS Administration, Division of Member
Services, not later than 10 days


                                       57
<PAGE>


from the date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in
the Bidder's Library.

Approximately every four months, AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor with a
complete file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for
the purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format
prescribed by AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE): Eligibility for KidsCare benefits requires that the
applicant/member not be enrolled with or entitled to any other health insurance
benefits. If the Contractor becomes aware of any such potential coverage, the
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. The Contractor shall follow the
same cost avoidance and postpayment recovery practices for the KidsCare
population as it does for the Title XIX population, and shall maintain a
reporting system which allows Title XIX and KidsCare information to be reported
separately.

41.      MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligible". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. The Contractor is responsible for adhering to the cost sharing
responsibilities presented in the AHCCCS Medicare Cost Sharing policy. Effective
10/1/97, the Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare
payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same service of a
non-Medicare member.

42.      COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-71l and R9-31-7ll.

43.      RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all reasonable times
during the term of this contract and the period set forth in paragraphs a. and
b. below any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by any
authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or federal government.


                                       58
<PAGE>


The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract except as provided
in paragraphs a. and b. below:

a.       If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records
         relating to the work terminated shall be preserved and made available
         for a period of five years from the date of any such termination.
b.       Records which relate to grievances, disputes, litigation or the
         settlement of claims arising out of the performance of this contract,
         or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has been
         taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of
         five years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44.      MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 working days
of receipt of request.

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical record is established
when information is received about a member. If the PCP has not yet seen the
member, such information may be kept temporarily in an appropriately labeled
file, in lieu of actually establishing a medical record, but must be associated
with the member's medical record as soon as one is established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 working days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member if the reason for such request is directly related to the
administration of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed. (ARS ss.36-6641)

45.      ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the Office of Managed Care.

46.      ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSAs as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

47.      DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines which is available in the Bidder's Library. The information
so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all procedures,
policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this contract. If any
of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter
changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.


                                       60
<PAGE>


The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in. the
submitted input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be
responsible for any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS
services providers (subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission,
deletion, or erroneous input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of
AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
describes the specific technical and procedural requirements for interfaces
between AHCCCS and the Contractor and its subcontractors. The Contractor is
responsible for complying with all technical requirements as stated in this
manual as well as any subsequent changes to the manual. A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI): In addition to the requirements outlined in
Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System, the Contractor will be required
to comply with all EDI standards which result from the Kennedy-Kassebaum
legislation. This law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
provide national electronic submission standards for health care data and may
include compliance with National Provider Identifier requirements. The Secretary
has 18 months to develop these standards. As the standards are finalized,
AHCCCSA will phase in the implementation. Electronic standards which may be
implemented include, but are not limited to, encounters, enrollment and
capitation payments.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE: The Contractor shall undertake all appropriate technical
planning measures to ensure timely compliance with all Year 2000 automated data
processing requirements.

48.      ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance measures. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered services for
which the Contractor incurred a financial liability,


                                       61
<PAGE>


including services provided during prior period coverage. This requirement is a
condition of the HCFA grant award.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA-supplied formats. Formatting and specific
requirements for encounter data are described in the AHCCCS Encounter Reporting
User Manual and the AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines, copies of which may
be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission Requirements are
included herein as Attachment I.

49.      MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and changes to
members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data which the Contractor shall
use to update its member records. The daily roster which is run prior to the
monthly roster is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate code
changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end of every month.
The roster will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of
the first day of the next month. This roster contains the information used by
AHCCCSA to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next mouth. The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly roster.
After reconciling the monthly roster information, the Contractor resumes posting
daily roster updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month.

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
available in the Bidder's Library for additional information.

50.      TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through 9/30/98. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the sole option to extend the term of the contract, not to
exceed a total contracting period of five years. The terms and conditions of any
such contract extension shall remain the same as the original contract, as
amended. Any contract extension, however, shall not affect the maximum
contracting period of five years. All contract extensions shall be through
contract amendment. If, in conjunction with a contract extension, AHCCCSA elects
to increase the capitation rate for any rate code category, such increase will
not exceed the inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has bad significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another. Further,
AHCCCSA may require a contractor to renew all GSAs, or may terminate remaining
GSAs if the Contractor does not agree to renew all GSAs.



                                       62
<PAGE>


When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the provisions of such
extension will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the extension amendment has not been signed by the
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing
that it refuses to sign the extension amendment If the Contractor provides such
notification, AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW - If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 120 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

51.      SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See policy on claims processing by
subcontracted providers in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing, and shall incorporate by
reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The following subcontracts
shall be submitted to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30
days prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.       Automated data processing
b.       Third-party administrators
c.       Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)
d.       Model subcontracts
e.       Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
         subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

See also Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement, regarding required
submission of hospital subcontracts.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is voidable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA. All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of federal and State laws,
regulations and policies.

                                       63
<PAGE>


The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider the
Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing services on its behalf more
than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions to this requirement include
the following:

a.       If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the
         contract year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the
         Contractor, the Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal
         to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt
         to gain such agreement.
b.       If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
         physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the
provisions of Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each
subcontract must contain the following:

a.       Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
         consideration to be received by the subcontractor. See Section D,
         Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement
b.       Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.
c.       Identification of the population, to include patient capacity, to be
         covered by the subcontractor.
d.       The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be provided, and
         for which compensation will be paid.
e.       The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending dates,
         methods of extension, termination and re-negotiation.
f.       The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of
         benefits and determination of third-party liability.
g.       A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and
         other third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or
         third-party liability payment before submitting claims to the
         Contractor/ Contractor.
h.       A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
         keeping system.
i.       Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
         assurance programs and comply with the utilization control and review
         procedures specified in 42 CFR Part 456, as implemented by AHCCCSA.
j.       A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in
         ownership of a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the
         Contractor shall require a contract amendment and prior approval of
         AHCCCSA.
k.       Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population.
l.       A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all
         tax obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other
         applicable insurance coverage obligations which arise under this
         subcontract, for itself and its employees, and that


                                       64
<PAGE>

         AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or
         insurance coverage.
m.       A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary
         authorization from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to
         eligible and/or enrolled members.
n.       A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting
         and claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

52.      SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over and supersede existing and future subcontracts for services
that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving this
requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement for
transplant surgery exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty
contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts.

AHCCCSA shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor
prior to the implementation of any specialty contract.

53.      MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA Contracting Office as described in
Section D, Paragraph 51, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must be submitted
with the proposed management fee agreement AHCCCSA reserves the right to perform
a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or corporate allocations
made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are determined to be
unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment to the Contractor,
the Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or financial
sanctions may be imposed.

54.      MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a consultant or actuary
are


                                       65
<PAGE>


less than $50,000, AHCCCSA will waive the requirement for an audit of that
consultant or actuary.

55.      MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 15 days after contract
award. Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSAs, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSAs awarded. This requirement is in addition to the
Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57 below and must be
met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirements may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA that
they are currently servicing must meet the equity per member standard (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) for their current
membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must fund
through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet this requirement.
Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional
capitalization for the new GSA they are bidding. (See the table of requirements
by GSA above). Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their
existing membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $5,000,000 in equity.

56.      PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash


                                       66
<PAGE>


deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA for as long as the Contractor has
AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more outstanding, or 15 months
following the effective date of this contract, whichever is later, to guarantee:
(1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to providers, non-contracting
providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance by the Contractor of its
obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond shall be in a form
acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS Performance Bond policy
available in the Office of Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.       Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers
         and nonproviders by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations
         under this contract,
b.       Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
         Contractor, and
c.       Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses
         incurred by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
         this contract, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after
         termination of this contract for reasons other than the convenience of
         the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor may not change
the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without prior written
approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

57.      AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid in the month of October, 1997, or as
determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include SOBRA
supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied by the Contractor not
later than 15 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the amount required.
Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics of the Contractor
on a monthly basis. If there is an increase in capitation payment that exceeds
10% of the performance bond amount, AHCCCSA may require an increase in the
amount of the Performance Bond. The Contractor shall have 15 days following
notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Performance Bond amount that must be


                                       67
<PAGE>


maintained after the contract term shall be sufficient to cover all outstanding
liabilities and will be determined by AHCCCSA. The Contractor may not change the
amount of the performance bond without prior written approval from AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care.

58.      FINANCIAL VIABILITY CRITERIA/ PERFORMANCE MEASURES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability criteria/performance
goals:

<TABLE>

                                          includes any long-term investments
                                          that can be converted to cash within
                                          24 hours without significant penalty

                                          number of non-SOBRA Family Planning
                                          Extension Services members enrolled

                                          result in an enrollment cap being
                                          imposed in any or all contracted
                                          GSAs.)

  MEDICAL EXPENSE RATIO                   Total medical expenses (net of

</TABLE>


59.      MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract
amendment. The Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or
transition plan to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review. The purpose of
the plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new
entity's ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to
members are not diminished and that major components of the organization and


                                       68
<PAGE>


AHCCCS programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or
change in ownership.

60.      SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or terminate this contract or any
related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-405 and R9-31-405 and
the terms of this contract and applicable law and regulations. AHCCCSA may, in
addition to these remedies, impose monetary sanctions if the Contractor violates
any provision stated in law or this contract in accordance with AHCCCS Rules
R9-22-406 and R9-31-406 and the provisions of this contract, applicable law and
regulations. Written notice will be provided to the Contractor specifying the
sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction and either the length of
suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be withheld. The Contractor
may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-804.

In addition to the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose partial or
full enrollment caps on the Contractor. Among the contract violations that may
result in an enrollment cap are, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Marketing violations
b.       Failure to meet AHCCCS financial viability standards
c.       Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network
d.       Quality of care and quality management issues
e.       Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards

CURE NOTICE PROCESS - Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of sanctions.

REDISTRIBUTION OF SANCTION DOLLARS: Monetary sanctions held by AHCCCSA may be
redistributed to participating acute care contractors based on criteria
described in the "AHCCCSA Special Performance Awards Policy", a copy of which
may be found in the Bidder's Library.

61.      AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to contractors
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm favors those
contractors with lower capitation rates. For further details on the AHCCCS
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change the
algorithm at any


                                       69
<PAGE>


time during the term of the contract and frequently does so in response to
contractor-specific issues of non-compliance (e.g. imposition of an enrollment
cap). The Contractor should consider this in preparing its response to this RFP.
AHCCCSA is not obligated to adjust for any financial impacts this may have on
the Contractor.

62.      GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. This written policy shall be in accordance with applicable federal
and State law and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not limited to, AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22-802; R9-31-802; R9-22-804 and R9-31-803.
The grievance process may not be delegated or subcontracted outside of the
health plan. Refer to Attachment H for a complete description of grievance
process requirements.

63.      QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Grievance and Appeals, using the Quarterly Grievance Report Format on file in
the Bidder's Library. The Quarterly Grievance Report must be received by the
AHCCCSA, Office of Grievance and Appeals, no later than 45 days from the end of
the quarter.

64.      KIDSCARE

In May, 1998, the Arizona legislature approved Senate Bill 1008 authorizing the
implementation of a Title XXI Children's Health Insurance Program, now referred
to in Arizona as "KidsCare". KidsCare provides health care coverage statewide to
eligible children 18 and younger and will be provided through the existing
AHCCCS health plans, state employee HMOs that elect to participate, and tribal
facilities or Indian Health Service for Native Americans who elect to receive
services through them. Services will also be directly provided by participating
community health clinics and hospitals which predominantly serve low income
children.

The KidsCare service package will generally include all services provided to
state employees by the least expensive commercial HMO. Those services,
limitations and exclusions are described in Section D, Paragraph 1, Scope of
Services. Capitation rates payable to the Contractor for KidsCare members (age
18 and younger) will be set by AHCCCSA in conjunction with an independent
actuary.

TITLE XXI PARENT/GUARDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: Title XXI legislation, ARS
ss.36.2984, mandates that the Contractor offer health insurance coverage to the
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a child who is eligible for Title XXI. The
Contractor shall establish rates for this coverage which must be approved by
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, prior to implementation. Title XXI funds or any
other federal or state funds shall not be used to subsidize family coverage. The
full cost of the premium shall be paid by the parent or legal guardian who
elects this coverage. The Contractor may include provisions for pre-existing
conditions and any other medical underwriting considerations that are necessary
to protect it from adverse risk. For further


                                       70
<PAGE>

information, refer to the Title XXI Parent/Guardian Health Insurance Coverage
Guidelines on file in the Bidder's Library.

65.      PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

In addition to the requirements described in this RFP, there are several
legislative issues that could have an impact on services provided by the
Contractor on or after October 1, 1998. The following is a brief description of
the issues that AHCCCS is aware of at the time of the issuance of this renewal
amendment:

ELIGIBILITY BASED ON 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL): Through a
successful initiative effort, eligibility for AHCCCS has been expanded to allow
persons with income up to 100% of the FPL to become eligible for the Medicaid
program. Legislative action will be required to implement this new eligibility
guideline and HCFA must approve the expansion. If HCFA approval is granted,
there will be a significant number of new persons who will be eligible for the
program and enrolled with the health plans at some future date.

<PAGE>

                           SECTION E: CONTRACT CLAUSES


[Only two paragraphs from Section E have been revised. They are shown below with
changes indicated:]


17.      SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT

The Contractor shall not employ, consult, subcontract or enter into any
agreement for Title XIX services with any person or entity who is debarred,
suspended or otherwise excluded from federal procurement activity. This
prohibition extends to any entity which employs, consults, subcontracts with or
otherwise reimburses for services any person substantially involved in the
management of another entity which is debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded
from federal procurement activity.

The Contractor shall not retain as a director, officer, partner or owner of 5%
or more of the Contractor entity, any person, or affiliate of such a person, who
is debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from federal procurement activity.

AHCCCSA may, by written notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate this
contract if it determines that the Contractor has been debarred, suspended or
otherwise lawfully prohibited from participating in any public procurement
activity.

19.      TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT

AHCCCSA reserves the right to terminate this contract in whole or in part due to
the failure of the Contractor to comply with any term or condition of the
contract or failure to take corrective action as required by AHCCCSA to comply
with the terms of the contract. If the Contractor is providing services under
more than one contract with AHCCCSA, AHCCCSA may deem unsatisfactory performance
under one contract to be cause to require the Contractor to provide assurance of
performance under any and all other contracts. In such situations, AHCCCSA
reserves the right to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches
of contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received. The
Contracting Officer shall mail written notice of the termination and the
reason(s) for it to the Contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested.

In the event the Contractor requests a hearing prior to termination, AHCCCSA is
required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to oversee the operation of the
Contractor entity through appointment of temporary management prior to the
hearing.

Upon termination under this paragraph, all documents, data, and reports prepared
by the Contractor under the contract shall become the property of and be
delivered to AHCCCSA on demand.

AHCCCSA may, upon termination of this contract, procure, on terms and in the
manner that it deems appropriate, materials or services to replace those under
this contract. The Contractor shall be liable for any excess costs incurred by
AHCCCSA in re-procuring the materials or services.

                   ATTACHMENT F: PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

The following table is a summary of the periodic reporting requirements for
AHCCCS acute care contractors and is subject to change at any time during the
term of the contract. The table is presented for convenience only and should not
be construed to limit the Contractor's responsibilities in any manner.

ATTACHMENT I:  ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any
findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the imposition
of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

Pended Encounter Corrections

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 100 days of the
original processing data. A sanction of $5.00 each month will be imposed for
each encounter pended for more than 100 days unless the pend is due to AHCCCSA
error. "AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter which (1) AHCCCSA
acknowledges to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the
system programming, an update to the database reference table, or further
research by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that the resolution of a pended
encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will respond in
writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA response
will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the
total number of encounters pended more than 100 days and the number of such
encounters not subject to sanction because of AHCCCSA error.

Pended encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 100 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon request,
make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

Encounter Validation Studies

Per HCFA requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data. Any and
all covered services may be validated as part of these studies. Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.



                                       75
<PAGE>

The following reflects AHCCCSA's encounter validation study process and sanction
policy as of 10/1/97. AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and
sanction amounts based on agency review or as a result of consultations with
HCFA. The Contractor will be notified in writing of any significant change in
study methodology.

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records requested
within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If
AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from the
Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

         Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date
         that the encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be
         received by AHCCCSA no later than 240 days after the end of the month
         in which the service was rendered, or the effective date of enrollment
         with the Contractor, whichever is later. For all encounters for which
         timeliness is evaluated, a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to
         the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter record is
         received by AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date determined above.
         It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per error
         extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
         may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has
         changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will
         be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the
         time the studies begin.

         Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate
         description of AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction
         per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
         assessed if the encounter is incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is
         anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per error
         extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
         may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has
         changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will
         be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the
         time the studies begin.

         Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
         inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or
         historical files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A"
         and for Study "B", a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the
         population of encounters may be assessed for an


                                       76
<PAGE>

         omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $5.00 per
         error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and
         $10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study
         "B"; however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines
         that encounter quality has changed, or if HCFA changes sanction
         requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in
         effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence
interval shows the range within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If
error rates are based on a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes
will be the lower limit of the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to HCFA, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance pursuant to Article 8 of AHCCCS Rules.
Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's capitation payment.

Replace with:


         For CYE `98 and CYE `99, AHCCCSA will offer a reconciliation process
         for contractors whose total PPC medical cost experience (excluding
         administrative and non-operating expenses) is more than 10% higher than
         the reimbursement associated with PPC in two areas: the "retro" portion
         of the capitation rate for all rate categories, and the prospective
         three-day notification period for MNMI recipients only. Expenses for
         the retro period only will be net of reinsurance.

         AHCCCSA will reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable costs
         as determined by reported encounters. AHCCCS may recoup from any.
         Contractor, profit amounts in excess of a 10% limit. Refer to the
         Office of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further
         details of the reconciliation process. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
         extend the reconciliation process into future contract years. AHCCCSA
         also reserves the right to adjust the risk-sharing arrangements in
         future years.

B.       Effective 10/1/98 the Contractor will be paid prospective and prior
         period capitation in accordance with the rates shown in the following
         table:

                        SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1.       SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22-202 et seq., the AHCCCS Medical
Policy Manual (AMPM), and the document entitled "AHCCCS Health Plan Performance
Indicators", all of which are incorporated herein by reference and may be found
in the Bidder's Library. The covered services are briefly described below.
Covered services must be medically necessary and provided by, or coordinated
with, a primary care provider, except for behavioral health and children's
preventive dental services. Services must be rendered by providers that are
appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their scope of practice,
and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall provide the same
standard of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997: This version of the AHCCCS acute care contract is
believed to contain all of the requirements mandated by the federal Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. The Contractor, however, shall be held liable for all
mandated requirements whether or not they appear in this renewal amendment.

KIDSCARE COVERED SERVICES: KidsCare members are eligible for the same services
covered for members under the Title XIX and state-only programs, with the
following differences, exclusions and/or limitations:

a.       Non-emergency transportation is not covered.

b.       Chiropractic services are not covered.

c.       Vision services are limited to one eye examination per contract year
         and one pair of glasses or contacts every contract year.

d.       EPSDT services are limited to those services specified in this
         contract.

e.       Behavioral health services are limited to 30 inpatient days and 30
         outpatient visits per contract year.  (See details under Section D
         Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.)

f.       Licensed midwives and home deliveries are not covered.

For further details regarding the KidsCare program, see Section D, Paragraph
64, KidsCare, and the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM).

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a free-standing surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through other than medical or surgical means
(i.e. hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                      10

CHILDREN'S REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions. Eligibility criteria and the
referral process are described in the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual
available in the Bidder's Library.

The Contractor is responsible for providing primary medical care and emergency
services not covered by CRS. The Contractor is also responsible for initial
care of newborn members, who are CRS eligible. The Contractor must require the
member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) to coordinate their care with the CRS
program. All services provided must be included in the member's medical record
maintained by the PCP.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS. If the member
uses their private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, and the
member is not enrolled with CRS, the Contractor is responsible for all
applicable deductibles and copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered
services to its members. Therefore, if the Contractor becomes aware that CRS
has failed to meet the established appointment standards, the Contractor shall
provide the services.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
Title XIX members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved

DENTAL: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services; dental

Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Measures. The Contractor
shall ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the
member has not been scheduled for a visit. If no dental screening is received
by the member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may
request dental services without referral and may choose a dental provider from
the Contractor's provider network. Members 21 years of age and older are
eligible for emergency dental services, medically necessary dentures and
pre-transplantation dental services only. Dental standards may be found in the
AMPM which is incorporated herein by reference and which may be found in the
Bidder's Library.

DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease

dialysis services.

EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT (EPSDT): The Contractor
shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment for members
under age 21. The Contractor shall ensure that these members receive required

with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule (Exhibit 430-1 in the AMPM) and to submit
to the AHCCCS Office of the Medical Director/Acute Care Unit, all EPSDT reports
as required by AHCCCS medical policy. The Contractor is required to meet
specific participation/utilization rates for members as described in Section D,
Paragraph 16, Performance Measures. Because the behavioral health benefit for
Title XIX and Title XXI is provided through the ADHS/RBHA system, the
Contractor shall ensure the initiation and coordination of the referral of
these

                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

members to the RBHA and shall follow up with the RBHA to monitor whether
members have received behavioral health services. Title XXI members are not
entitled to the all-encompassing EPSDT service package required for Title XIX
children. Title XXI children are entitled only to the EPSDT and other covered
services specified in this document, the AMPM and the Title XXI State Plan.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

a.     Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
       professionals to provide pre-hospital, emergency care on a
       24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
       emergent condition as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-101 and R9-31-101.
       Emergency medical services are covered without prior authorization. The
       Contractor is encouraged to contract with emergency service facilities
       for the provision of emergency services. The Contractor is encouraged to
       contract with or employ the services of non-emergency facilities (e.g.
       urgent care centers) to address member non-emergency care issues
       occurring after regular office hours or on weekends. The Contractor
       shall be responsible for educating members and providers regarding
       appropriate utilization of emergency room services including behavioral
       health emergencies. The Contractor shall monitor emergency services
       utilization (by both provider and member) and shall have guidelines for
       implementing corrective action for inappropriate utilization. For
       utilization review, the test for appropriateness of the request for
       emergency services shall be whether a prudent layperson, similarly
       situated, would have requested such services. For purposes of this
       contract, a "prudent layperson" is defined as a person without medical
       training who exercises those qualities of attention, knowledge,
       intelligence and judgment which society requires of its members for the
       protection of their own interest and the interests of others. The phrase
       does not apply to a person's ability to reason, but rather the prudence
       with which he acts under a given set of circumstances.

b.     All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition

c.     Emergency transportation

d.     Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
       assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent
       situations, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

e.     The Contractor shall comply with established guidelines regarding the
       coordination of post-stabilization care.

EYE EXAMINATIONS/OPTOMETRY: The Contractor shall provide all medically

medical condition, cataract removal, and/or medically necessary vision
examinations and prescriptive lenses if required following cataract removal and
other eye conditions as specified in the AMPM.

members who choose to delay or prevent pregnancy. These include medical,
surgical, pharmacological and laboratory services, as well as contraceptive
devices. Information and counseling necessary to allow the members to make
informed decisions regarding family planning methods shall also be included. If
the Contractor does not provide family planning services, it must contract for
these services through another health care delivery system, which allows
members freedom of choice in selecting a provider. A prospective offeror may
discuss arrangements for family planning services only with other prospective
offerors during the RFP process for the purpose of making arrangements for the
provision of family planning services.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family
Planning Services Extension Program; a program that provides only family
planning services for a maximum of 24 months to women whose SOBRA eligibility
has terminated. The Contractor is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a
SOBRA woman is sterilized to prevent inappropriate enrollment in the SOBRA
Family Planning Services Extension Program. Notification may be made at the
time the newborn is reported or after the sterilization procedure is completed.

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND SCREENING: The Contractor shall provide these
services for non-hospitalized members 21 years of age and older. These services
include, but are not limited to, screening for hypertension,


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

extended stay in the hospital of birth when the mother's continued stay in the
hospital is beyond the 48 or 96 hour stay.

MEDICALLY-NECESSARY ABORTIONS: This service is covered for a member if the
member suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness
including a life endangering physical condition caused by or rising from the
pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, place the member in
danger of death unless an abortion is performed. The service is also covered
for Title XIX and Title XXI members if the pregnancy is caused by rape or
incest. Providers must document and submit to the Contractor a Certificate of

4.       VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of the Social
Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program which became
effective 10/1/94. Through this program, the federal and state governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. Therefore, the Contractor shall not utilize AHCCCS
funding to purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19. Any provider,
licensed by the State to administer immunizations, may register with ADHS as a
"VFC provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall comply with all
VFC requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if providing
immunizations to AHCCCS members under the age of 19, the providers are
registered with ADHS/VFC.

5.       DENIALS OR REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES

When a covered service is denied, reduced, suspended or terminated, the
Contractor shall comply with the notice, appeal and continuation of benefits
requirements specified in 42 CFR 431.200 et seq., AAC R9-22, Article 13
outlining members' rights and responsibilities, and AHCCCS policy.

6.       ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll members. The
Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any reason unless directed to do
so by AHCCCSA. Eligibility for the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined
by one of the following agencies:

                                          programs.
</TABLE>

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9. Article 17.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

Acute members, except for those eligible under the MN/MI program have a choice
of available health plans. A listing of the available health plans and their
telephone numbers will be given to each applicant during the application process
for AHCCCS benefits. Also included are instructions to applicants to call the
health plans directly with specific questions concerning the health plan. If
there is only one health plan available for the applicant's Geographical Service
Area, no choice is offered. Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA's being
notified of their eligibility are automatically assigned to a health plan based
on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm.

Title XXI members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned. When a member is transferred from
Title XIX to Title XXI and has not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the
member will remain with the Title XIX health plan and a choice notice will be
sent to the member. The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from
the date the choice notice is sent.

AHCCCSA assigns MN/MI members to an available health plan, based on family
continuity or through AHCCCSA's auto-assignment algorithm. These members do not
get a choice of available contractors until their annual enrollment choice
period.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX and state-only members
include: previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90
days will be automatically enrolled with the same contractor, if that contractor
is still available. Also, women whose SOBRA eligibility have terminated and have
become enrolled in the Family Planning Services Extension Program will
automatically remain assigned to the same health plan. The Family Planning
Services Extension Program provides a maximum of 24 months of family planning
services.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX or state-only member with
the Contractor will generally be the day prior to the date the Contractor
receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily roster. However, the Contractor
is responsible for payment of medically necessary covered services retroactive
to the member's beginning date of eligibility, excluding any prior quarter
coverage period.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member will be the first day of
the month following notification to the health plan. If a Title XXI member is
determined eligible by the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled with
the health plan as of the 1st of the following month. If the member is
determined eligible AFTER the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled
with the health plan as of the 1st of the second following month.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for Title XIX and
state-only members. For Title XIX members, prior period coverage starts from the
first day of the month of application, or first eligible month. The Contractor
is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary covered
services


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       19
<PAGE>

provided to Title XIX members during prior period coverage. For state-only EAC
members, prior period coverage does not apply. For state-only MN/MI and ELIC
members prior period coverage is generally limited to the two days prior to the
date of AHCCCSA being notified of eligibility. However, prior period coverage
could include additional days prior to the date of enrollment. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary covered services
provided on an emergency basis to state-only members pursuant to ARS ss.36-2908
and ARS ss.36-2909 for the first two days of the prior period coverage. Any
additional prior period coverage for state-only members will include all claims
for medically necessary covered services. This may include services provided
prior to the contract year. (See Section D, Paragraph 37, Compensation, for a
description of the Contractor's reimbursement from AHCCCSA for this eligibility
time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers, including Title XXI mothers,
who were enrolled at the time of the child's birth and whose newborn
notification was received by AHCCCSA will be enrolled with the mother's health
plan. The Contractor is responsible for notifying AHCCCSA of a child's birth to
an enrolled member. Capitation to the Contractor will begin on the date
notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of births during prior
period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the newborn's
date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered services to the
newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification of the child's birth.
Note that AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification calls 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. Title XIX and Title XXI eligible mothers of newborns are
sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for
their child; otherwise the child will remain with the mother's contractor.
Newborns of MN/MI mothers are enrolled with the mother's contractor for a
minimum of 30 days up to a maximum of 60 days. Newborns of FES mothers are
auto-assigned to a health plan and mothers of these newborns are sent a letter
advising them of their right to choose a different health plan for their child.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, or as an Eligible Assistance Child (EAC), the member is guaranteed a
minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Upon initial capitated
enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of
12 full months of continuous enrollment. Enrollment guarantees do not apply to
Native Americans who choose to obtain their covered services through Indian
Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service basis or children enrolled with
Department of Economic Security/Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program. The
enrollment guarantee applies a maximum of one time per member per eligibility
category for Title XIX, Title XXI and EAC members. If a member changes from one
contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of
the guarantee period applies to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may
not be granted or may be terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor
child is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22, Article 17 and R9-31, Article 3 describes
other reasons for which the enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans eligible under any coverage group other than
MN/MI, on or off-reservation, have a choice to receive services from Indian
Health Service (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility or any available contractor.
If choice is not available or made within the specified time limit, Native
American Title XIX and state-only members living on-reservation will be assigned
to IHS and Native American Title XIX and state-only members living
off-reservation will be assigned to an available contractor using AHCCCSA's
family continuity policy and auto-assignment algorithm. Native Americans may
change from IHS to a contractor or from a contractor to IHS at any time. Native
American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being determined
eligible.

7.       MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, or physical or mental handicap, except where
medically indicated. Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not
limited to, the following:

a.       Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
         available facility.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       20
<PAGE>

b.       Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
         provided in a different manner or at a different time from that
         provided to other members, other public or private patients or the
         public at large except where medically necessary.
c.       Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
         related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in
         any way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed
         by others receiving any covered service.
d.       The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the
         basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
         ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
         membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
         served.

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e. the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

8.       MEMBER INFORMATION

All informational materials prepared by the Contractor shall be approved by
AHCCCSA prior to distribution to members. The reading level and name of the
evaluation methodology used should be included when 200 members or 5% of the
Contractor's enrolled population, whichever is greater, speak a 2nd language,
the Contractor shall provide member information in that 2nd language. The
Contractor shall comply whenever it is aware that a population meets this
standard. When there are program or service site changes notification will be
provided to the affected members at least 14 days before implementation. The
Contractor shall review and update the Member Handbook at least once a year. The
Handbook must be submitted to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care for approval by
Sept. 1 of each contract year, or within four weeks of receiving the annual
renewal amendment, whichever is later.

The Contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all information prepared
for distribution to members is written at a 4th grade level.

each member or family within 10 days of receipt of notification of the
enrollment date:

Contractor's membership. AHCCCSA will design a questionnaire to assess
accessibility, availability and continuity of care with PCPs; communication
between members and the Contractor, and general member satisfaction with the
AHCCCS program. To ensure comparability of results, the questions to the members
will be the same for all contractors. AHCCCSA will consider suggestions from the

11.      ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE

AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual
anniversary date. AHCCCSA may hold an open enrollment on a limited basis as
deemed necessary. During AEC, members may change contractors subject to the
availability of other contractors within their Geographic Service Area. Members
are mailed a printed enrollment form and may choose a new contractor by
contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process. If the member does not
participate in the AEC, no change of contractor will be made (except for
approved changes under the Change of Plan Policy) during the new anniversary
year. This holds true if the Contractor's contract is renewed and the member
continues to live in the Contractor's service area. The Contractor shall comply
with the Office of Managed Care Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice
and Other Plan Changes policy.

implement policies and procedures, which comply with AHCCCS medical policy to
address transition of:

         the transitioning member by the relinquishing contractor; and

5.       Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost of reproducing
         and forwarding medical records shall be the responsibility of the
         relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification of the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible to coordinate care with
the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and for
providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions of how to obtain services.

In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is terminated for any reason,
or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the transition of its members
to other contractors, and shall abide by standards and protocols set forth
above. In addition, AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the
contract on a month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of members. The
Contractor shall make provision for continuing all management and administrative
services until the transition of all members is completed and all other
requirements of this contract are satisfied. The Contractor shall be responsible

         3)   Copies of all bank statements received by the Contractor.

              Such  reports shall be due on the fifth day of each succeeding
              month for the prior month.

d.       In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCSA,
         such termination or suspension shall not affect the obligation of the
         Contractor to indemnify AHCCCSA for any claim by any third party
         against the State or AHCCCSA arising from the Contractor's performance
         of this contract and for which the Contractor would otherwise be liable
         under this contract.

e.       Any dispute by the Contractor with respect to termination or suspension
         of this contract by AHCCCSA shall be exclusively governed by the
         provisions of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

                  members to make decisions about medical care, including the
                  right to accept or refuse medical care, and the right to
                  execute an advance directive. If the agency/organization has a
                  conscientious objection to carrying out an advance directive,
                  it must be explained in policies. (A health care provider is
                  not prohibited from making such objection when made pursuant
                  to ARS ss.36-3205.C.1.)
         (2)      Provide written information to adult members regarding each
                  individual's rights under State law to make decisions
                  regarding medical care, and the health care provider's written
                  policies concerning advance directives (including any
                  conscientious objections).
         (3)      Documenting in the member's medical record whether or not the
                  adult member has been provided the information and whether an
                  advance directive has been executed.
         (4)      Not discriminating against a member because of his or her
                  decision to execute or not execute an advance directive, and
                  not making it a condition for the provision of care.
         (5)      Providing education to staff on issues concerning advance
                  directives including notification of direct care providers of
                  services, such as home health care and personal care, of any
                  advanced directives executed by members to whom they are
                  assigned to provide services.

b.       Contractors shall encourage subcontracted PCPs to comply with the
         requirements of subparagraph a. (2) through (5) above. Contractors
         shall also encourage health care providers specified in subparagraph a.

         provide a copy of the member's executed advanced directive, or
         documentation of refusal, to the member's PCP for inclusion in the
         member's medical record.

16.      PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

All performance measures described below apply to Title XIX, Title XXI, and
state-only member populations.

Contractors shall strive to meet the AHCCCS stated performance measure goals.
However, it is equally important that Contractors continually improve their
performance measure outcomes from year to year. Improvement in performance is to
be measured by a reduction in the health plan's adverse outcomes. AHCCCS
requires the Contractor to achieve a reduction of ten percent or more from the
previous year's adverse outcomes. The Contractor's performance will also be
evaluated against the adjusted AHCCCS statewide average performance level,
excluding the effect of the Contractor's data.

AHCCCS will require the Contractor to have a quality improvement plan in place
when:

a)       the Contractor has not achieved the AHCCCS statewide performance level
         for any measure but has shown significant improvement, or

b)       the Contractor's rate has declined but is at or above the AHCCCS
         statewide performance level for any measure.

The Contractor will be required to submit a corrective action plan and may be
subject to sanctions if:

a)       the Contractor has not achieved the AHCCCS statewide performance level
         for any measure and has failed to show adequate improvement, or

b)       if the Contractor's rate has declined and fallen below the AHCCCS
         statewide performance level for any measure.

Corrective action plans must be received by the Office of the Medical Director
within 30 days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS. AHCCCS may conduct one or
more follow-up on-site reviews to verify compliance with a corrective action
plan.

EPSDT PARTICIPATION: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program to at least 80% of all enrolled
members under age 21 during CYE 2000. The participant rate is the number of
children receiving at least one medical screen compared to the number of
children expected to receive at least one medical screen. The number of children
expected to receive at least one medical screen is based on the federal
periodicity schedule and the average period of eligibility.

AHCCCSA will measure participation levels through encounter data and will not
use information from prior period coverage (see Paragraph D.6, Prior Period
Coverage) in evaluating the Contractor's performance.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal

</TABLE>

The Contractor shall conduct an annual immunization audit based on random
sampling to assess and verify the immunization status of two-year-old members.
AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, within two weeks after the end of the
contract year, the selected sample, specifications for conducting the audit, the
AHCCCSA reporting requirements, and technical assistance. The Contractor shall
identify each child's PCP, conduct the assessment, and report to AHCCCSA in the
required format all immunization data for the sampled two-year-old children no
later than December 15 after the end of the contract year. If medical records
are missing for more than 5% of the sample group, the Contractor is subject to
sanctions by AHCCCSA. The External Quality Review Contractor will conduct a
study to validate the Contractor's reported rates.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: For CYE 2000, the Contractor shall comply with AHCCCS
quality management requirements to improve performance for all AHCCCS
established performance indicators. Complete descriptions of these indicators
can be found in the document Health Plan Performance Indicators, User and
Technical Specifications. AHCCCS has established goals for the following
indicators: annual dental visits; well-child visits in the first 15 months of
life; and well-child visits in the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th years of life.

ANNUAL DENTAL VISITS: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
utilization of dental services for members under age 21. At least 55% of all
enrolled members between the ages of 3 to 21 shall have at least one dental
visit during CYE 2000. AHCCCSA will monitor utilization through reported
encounter data.

WELL CHILD VISITS IN THE FIRST 15 MONTHS OF LIFE: The Contractor shall ensure
that members under the age of 15 months receive all recommended well-child
visits as specified in the AMPM. During CYE 2000, the Contractor shall ensure
that a minimum of 64% of its members receive all recommended well-child visits.

WELL-CHILD VISITS IN THE 3RD, 4TH, 5TH AND 6TH YEARS OF LIFE: The Contractor
shall ensure that members 3, 4, 5 and 6 years of age receive all recommended

17.      QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT (QM/UM)

The Contractor shall provide to members quality medical care as described in the
AMPM, Chapter 900, regardless of payer source or eligibility category. The
Contractor shall institute processes to assess, plan, implement and evaluate
quality improvement activities. The Contractor shall conduct two clinical
studies each contract year as required in Chapter 900 of the AMPM. AHCCCSA will
determine the subject matter and study methodology for one of the annual studies
and the Contractor shall submit to AHCCCSA by November 15 of each contract year
its proposed subject matter and methodology for the other. The results of the
studies shall be submitted to AHCCCS, Office of the Medical Director, within 180
days after the end of each contract year.

The Contractor must maintain a written QM/UM plan, which details plans for
compliance with the AMPM. The Contractor shall incorporate in its QM/UM plan an
action plan for improving the performance rates for those indicators with
established baselines.

18.      PHYSICIAN INCENTIVES

The Contractor must comply with all applicable physician incentive requirements
and conditions defined in 42 CFR 417.479. These regulations prohibit physician
incentive plans that directly or indirectly make payments to a doctor or a group
as an inducement to limit or refuse medically necessary services to a member.
The Contractor is required to disclose all physician incentive agreements to
AHCCCSA and to AHCCCS members who request them.

The Contractor shall not enter into contractual arrangements that place

22.      PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall include in its provider network a sufficient number of PCPs
to meet the requirements of this contract. Health care providers designated by
the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as allopathic or osteopathic
physicians who generally specialize in family practice, internal medicine,
obstetrics, gynecology, or pediatrics; certified nurse practitioners or
certified nurse midwifes; or physician's assistants.

At a minimum, the Contractor's number of full-time equivalent PCPs to enrolled
members shall not exceed a ratio of 1:1800 for adults and 1:1200 for children
who are 12 or younger. If the PCP contracts with more than one AHCCCS health
plan, the ratio shall be adjusted by the Contractor to ensure the total number
of AHCCCS members does not exceed the above ratio. The Contractor should
consider the PCP's total patient panel size (i.e., AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS
patients) when assessing the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS' appointment and other
standards. In addition, AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of the
PCP's panel of patients. The Contractor shall also reduce the number of members
assigned to its network PCPs as necessary to meet the appointment standards
specified in Section D, Paragraph 19, Appointment Standards. Any variation to
the above standards must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director
for prior approval. PCPs with assigned members diagnosed with AIDS or as
HIV-positive shall meet criteria and standards set forth in AHCCCS Medical
Policy and AHCCCS AIDS Advisory Committee Guidelines.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data regarding
PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign members with
complex medical conditions who are age 12 and younger to Board-certified
pediatricians.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice in selecting a PCP. When a new member has been assigned to the
Contractor, the Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment
and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's receipt of
notification of assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include with the
enrollment notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs and the
process for changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so. The
Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to the member. Members may
make both their initial PCP selection and any subsequent PCP changes either
verbally or in writing.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a.       Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member

b.       Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care

c.       Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member

d.       Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
         services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
         referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational
audits. PCPs and specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's
members shall have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one
general acute care hospital that is located within the Contractor's service
area.

23.      OTHER PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to:

a.       Recruit sufficient specialty physicians, dentists, health care
         professionals, health care institutions and support services to meet
         the medical needs of its members.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       32
<PAGE>
b.       Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
         network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of
         care to members with limited proficiency in English.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AIICCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

For specialty services, the Contractor shall ensure that:

a.       PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except
         that women shall have direct access to GYN providers without a referral
         for preventive and routine services. Any waiver of this requirement by
         the Contractor must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.

b.       Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a
         medical condition other than that for which the member was referred,
         unless approved by the member's PCP.

c.       The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP complete
         documentation of all diagnostic services including copies of test
         results if applicable, treatment services provided and the resulting
         outcome for each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.       Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are
         general practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics

b.       Certified nurse midwives

c.       Licensed midwives.

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric care (physician
or certified nurse midwife). Such assignment shall be consistent with the
freedom of choice requirements for selecting health care professionals while
ensuring that the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a
PCP for medical care as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges. Licensed midwives perform deliveries only in the member's
home. Labor and delivery services may also be provided in the member's home by
physicians and certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.

24.      NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient professional and
paramedical personnel for the provision of covered services, including emergency
medical care on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall
be sufficient to provide covered services within designated time and distance
limits. For Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that
95% of its members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and
Tucson do not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP or pharmacy. 95% of
its members residing outside the boundary area must not have to travel more than
10 miles to see such providers. See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements,
for details on network requirements by Geographic Service Area. Also see Section
D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for details on
changes in hospital subcontracting effective October 1, 1998.

Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall not discriminate
with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program, reimbursement or
indemnification against any provider based solely on the provider's type of
licensure or certification. This provision, however, does not prohibit the
Contractor from limiting provider


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       33
<PAGE>
participation to the extent necessary to meet the needs of the Contractor's
members. This provision also does not interfere with measures established by the
Contractor to control costs consistent with its responsibilities under this
contract.

25.      NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertains to all
service specifications described in the Chapters 300, 600 and 900. In addition,
the Contractor shall have policies on how the Contractor will:

a.       Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program
         changes and requirements

b.       Monitor and control network compliance with policies and rules of
         AHCCCSA and the Contractor, including compliance with all policies and
         procedures related to the grievance process and ensuring the member's
         care is not compromised during the grievance process.

c.       Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network

d.       Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
         network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service
         area

e.       Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient providers
         to handle the volume of members

f.       Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring appointment
         procedures standards, appointment waiting times, and service provision
         standards

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one,
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract. The
Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned material changes in the
provider network before the change process has begun, for example before issuing
a 60-day termination notice to a provider. The notification shall be made within
one working day if the change is unexpected. AHCCCSA will assess proposed
changes in the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members'
health care and provide a written response to the Contractor within 14 days of
receipt of request. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care if the provider network change is likely to result in
deficient delivery of covered services.

26.      FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the federal mandates in OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. This
legislation gives FQHCs the option to require state Medicaid programs to
reimburse the FQHC at 100% of reasonable costs for the services delivered to
Title XIX members. AHCCCSA and its contractors are required to comply with this
legislation. The following payment methodology for reasonable cost reimbursement
was implemented effective October 1, 1997.

If the FQHC elects reasonable cost reimbursement, the FQHC will receive a
quarterly payment per Title XIX member per month from AHCCCSA. The initial
capitation amount will be $1.75 PMPM statewide. In accordance with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, this additional reimbursement will be phased out over a
five-year period beginning in contract year ending 2000:

reimbursement from AHCCCSA.

27.      PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number. A
Provider Participation Agreement must be signed with each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

28.      PROVIDER AFFILIATION TAPE

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its HCFA grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

a.       Timeliness:       Reports or other required data shall be received on
                           or before scheduled due dates.

b.       Accuracy:         Reports or other required data shall be prepared in
                           strict conformity with appropriate authoritative
                           sources and/or AHCCCS defined standards.

c.       Completeness:     All  required information shall be fully disclosed
                           in a manner that is both responsive and pertinent
                           to report intent with no material omissions.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       35
<PAGE>

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time dining the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

30.      DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA, or the federal government, to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials which are produced by the Contractor and
refer to covered services shall state that such services are funded under
contract with AHCCCSA.

31.      REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.

32.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business for the initial contract year beginning 10/1/97.
The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess new contractors' readiness and
ability to provide contract services to members at the start of the contract
year. A new contractor will be permitted to commence operations only if the
Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's satisfaction.

33.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with HCFA requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular Operational
and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not limited to) ensuring
operational and financial program compliance. The Reviews will identify areas
where improvements can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and provide the
Contractor with technical assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply
with all other medical audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-52l and
R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AMCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel as identified in advance shall be
available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       36

activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA or
any other nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the
entire NCQA report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and Financial Review
Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior to
AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review findings
may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements must be implemented by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to
determine the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations and
achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be conducted at any time
after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

34.      CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-705, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. In the absence
of a subcontract provision to the contrary, claims submission deadlines shall be
calculated from the date of service or the effective date of enrollment,
whichever is later. Remittance advices accompanying the Contractor's payments to
providers must contain, at a minimum, adequate descriptions of all denials and
adjustments, the reasons for such denials and adjustments, the amount billed,
the amount paid, and grievance rights. The Contractor's claims payment system,
as well as its prior authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize
the likelihood of having to recoup already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess
of $50,000 per provider within a contract year must be approved in advance by
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall ensure
that 90% of all clean claims are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean
claim and 99% are paid within 90 days of receipt of the clean claim.

During the term of this contract, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring all health plans
to use a standardized electronic format for electronic claims processing between
the plan and its providers. AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the
Technical Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by FFS providers and their billing agents who submit claims
electronically to AHCCCS. The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts will be supplemented
by a Form C layout. All formats are subject to changes initiated by the
Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation. Reasonable implementation timeframes will be
negotiated with each plan.

35.      HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES ONLY: Laws of 1996 Chapter 288 Section 20 authorizes
the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective from
October 1, 1997, through September 30, 2000. The Pilot as defined by AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-718 requires hospital subcontracts to be negotiated between health plans
in Maricopa and Pima counties and hospitals to establish reimbursement levels,
terms and conditions. Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor and
hospitals to cover operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims submission
and payment, payment of discounts or penalties, legal resolution, which may, as
an option, include establishing arbitration procedures. These negotiated
subcontracts shall remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to insure availability
of quality services within specific service districts, equity of related party
interests, reasonableness of rates, and only marketing of contracted
organizations. The general provisions of this program encompass acute care
hospital services and outpatient


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       37
<PAGE>

hospital services that result in an admission. The Contractor shall submit all
hospital subcontracts and any amendments to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, for
prior approval. For non-emergency patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that
at least 85% of its members use contracted hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right
to subsequently adjust the 85% standard. Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the
number of emergency days at a particular non-contracted hospital becomes
significant, AHCCCSA may require a subcontract at that hospital. Hospitals and
health plans/program contractors outside of Maricopa and Pima counties are not
included in this Pilot. Offerors should refer to the "Hospital Reimbursement
Pilot Program Packet" for additional information and requirements.

ALL GSA'S EXCEPT MARICOPA AND PIMA: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals for
member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain contracts with hospitals in all other GSA's and must submit
copies of these contracts to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, at least seven
days prior to the effective dates thereof.

FOR OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state
hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical reviews of all
hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously paid claims are subject to
recoupment If the Contractor fails to identify lack of medical necessity through
concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review, lack of medical necessity
identified during postpayment medical review shall not constitute a basis for
recoupment by the Contractor. See also Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment
System. For a more complete description of the guidelines for hospital
reimbursement, please consult the Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and
rules.

36.      NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility
described above applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. To further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member
could be ALTCS eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that
occurs on the same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of services while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor. The Contractor is not responsible for the full 90 days of nursing
facility coverage if ALTCS enrollment occurs before the 90 days has ended.

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in a
nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If
the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program
Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility coverage,
the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage during the time
the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing facility services covered by
a third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day maximum.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal

<PAGE>
37.      COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, SOBRA supplement, HIV-AIDS supplement,
reinsurance (PPC and prospective), and third party liability, as described and
defined within this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of ARS Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer nor indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, any
savings remaining to the Contractor as a result of favorable claims experience
and efficiencies in service delivery at the end of the contract term may be kept
by the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be separately
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund, as described in ARS ss.36-2913. An error discovered by the State with or
without an audit in the amount of fees paid to Contractor will be subject to
adjustment or repayment by Contractor making a corresponding decrease in a
current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment by AHCCCSA to
the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the Contractor. This
section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from making payment to a
fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required copayment from
members but service will not be denied for inability to pay the copayment.
Except for permitted copayments, the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not
bill or attempt to collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all PPC member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during prior period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation
described below. Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of
members who were enrolled at the time of delivery.

RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For CYE `98 and CYE `99, AHCCCSA
will offer a reconciliation process for contractors whose total PPC medical cost
experience (excluding administrative and non-operating expenses) is more than
10% higher than the reimbursement associated with PPC in two areas: the "retro"
portion of the capitation rate for all rate categories, and the prospective
three-day notification period for MNMI recipients only. Expenses for the retro
period only will be net of reinsurance.

AHCCCSA will reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable costs in excess
of a 10% limit as determined by reported encounters. AHCCCS will recoup profit
amounts in excess of a 10% limit.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       39
<PAGE>
For contract years beginning with CYE `00, a full reconciliation to 0% profit or
loss will be done by AHCCCSA for the same eligibility time periods and risk
groups noted above. AHCCCSA will reimburse the health plans 100% of any excess
reasonable costs as determined by reported encounters, and all profits will be
recouped. Refer to the Office of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for
further details of the reconciliation process.

KIDSCARE CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation for KidsCare members
in the same manner as prospective capitation (see above). KidsCare capitation
rates will be set by AHCCCSA in conjunction with an independent actuary.
Following CYE 99, AHCCCSA will review the assumptions made in setting the
capitation rates and may, at its option, reconcile and/or adjust the rates.

DELIVERY SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: In addition to the capitation payment described above, a
separate and additional payment will be made to the Contractor to help defray
costs for members receiving approved protease inhibitors and associated lab work
related to their treatment for HIV/AIDS. The list of AHCCCSA-approved protease
inhibitors is available in the Bidder's Library.

On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, an unduplicated monthly count of members, by rate code, who are using
approved protease inhibitors. The report shall be submitted, along with the
quarterly financial reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each
quarter.

The rate of reimbursement for this separate per member per month payment is
specified in Section B and is subject to review during the term of the contract.
Payment will be made quarterly to the Contractor based on the reported members
for the preceding quarter. AHCCCSA will review this HIV/AIDS-related data at
least annually as part of its Operational and Financial Review and reserves the
right to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members as determined through
this review as well as an associated penalty for incorrect reporting.

Refer to the Office of Managed Care's HIV/AIDS supplemental payment and review
policies for further details and requirements.

INCENTIVE FUND: AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of capitation
reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors based on their performance
measure outcomes. AHCCCSA will notify Contractors 60 days prior to a new
contract year if this methodology will be implemented and will provide details
of the reimbursement methodology at that time. See Paragraph 16, Performance
Measurement for more details on the performance goals.

38.      CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect of a
program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is needed. In these
instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions discussed with the
Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The Contractor may request a
review of a program change if it believes the program change was not equitable;
AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       40
<PAGE>
a.       death of a member

b.       member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date
         of incarceration)

c.       duplicate capitation to the same contractor

If a member is enrolled twice with the same contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39.      REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program
provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered
inpatient facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical
condition beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503 and R9-31-503). Per
diem rates paid for nursing facility services, including room and board,
provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall
be eligible for reinsurance coverage. Refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program. Reinsurance
for the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (See Section D, Paragraph 35,
Hospital Reimbursement), will be paid in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503
and R9-31-503.

AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Prospective reinsurance coverage applies to prospective enrollment periods. The
deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS acute care
enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services) as of
October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown in the
following table. These deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during
the term of this contract.

</TABLE>

A Contractor whose enrollment qualifies for the $35,000 or $50,000 non-MN/MI
deductible level may, prior to the start of the contract period, elect one of
the lower deductible levels indicated in the above table. Contractors may not
elect to increase their deductible level. If a Contractor's actual non-MN/MI
deductible is $35,000 or $50,000, AHCCCSA will increase the Contractor's
capitation rate awarded by defined amounts for each capitation risk group. These
specific capitation adjustments are available from the Office of Managed Care.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: A separate reinsurance deductible and
coinsurance percentage will apply during prior period coverage. As noted in the
table above, all Contractors, regardless of enrollment, will be subject to a
$5,000 deductible level. The coinsurance percentage for the prior period
coverage reinsurance is 100%. Expenses incurred during prior period coverage
will not apply toward the prospective reinsurance thresholds.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance benefits. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide
for a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used
in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       41
<PAGE>
Effective October 1, 1998, when a member changes Contractors within a contract
year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs incurred for that
member will follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all
submitted encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of
service within the current contract year) will be applied toward the receiving
health plan's deductible level. For further details regarding this policy and
other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing
Manual.

Medical review on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance cases will
be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random sampling.
AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director, will generate the sampling and will
notify the Contractor of documentation needed for the retrospective medical
review process to occur at the Contractor's offices. Reinsurance consideration
will be given to inpatient facility contracts, and hearing decisions rendered by
the Office of Legal Assistance. Pre-hearing and/or hearing penalties
discoverable during the review process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance.
A recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor will occur
based on the results of the medical review sampling. The results of the medical
review sampling will be separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and
prior period coverage reinsurance reimbursement populations in the review time
frame for the Contractor. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days
advance notice of any on-site review. The Contractor shall have all requested
medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall
be made available upon request of the Review Team during the course of the
review. The Contractor representative shall be available to the Review Team at
all times during AHCCCSA on-site review activities. While on-site, the
Contractor shall provide the Review Team with workspace, access to a telephone,
electrical outlets and privacy for conferences. The Contractor will be furnished
a copy of the Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the onsite review and
given an opportunity to comment on any review findings.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia, von Willebrand's Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. This program
also covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and tissue
transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver, kidney,
and other organ transplantation. For additional detail and restrictions refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All catastrophic claims are
subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of the Medical Director, Reinsurance
Unit, of cases identified for catastrophic non-transplant reinsurance coverage
within 30 days of (a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and
(c) the beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid
for a maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to
AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When a member is identified as being catastrophically eligible by
AHCCCSA due to the specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1,
286.2), all medically necessary covered services provided during the contract
year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders and
dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify AHCCCS
Office of the Medical Director Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis. All medically
necessary covered services provided during the contract year shall be eligible
for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy. All medically necessary covered services provided during
the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's
paid amount.

                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       42

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts and cornea transplantation services are not eligible
for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the regular
(non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM, Chapter 300 for
covered services for organ and tissue transplants. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount,
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library. When a member is referred to a transplant facility for an
AHCCCS-covered organ transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of
the Medical Director.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits
for transplants. However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the
responsibility for submitting encounters for all catastrophic reinsurance
services.

All reinsurance claims must be submitted in accordance with R9-22-703 and the
AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

40.      COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and postpayment recovery. See Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare
Services and Cost Sharing.

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor's
network. The Contractor's liability for coinsurance and deductibles is limited
to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service pursuant to a
written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service rate, less any
amount paid by the third party. (The Contractor must decide whether it is more
cost-effective to provide the service within its network or pay coinsurance and
deductibles for a service outside its network. For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its network.) If the
Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer (other than
Medicare), and the insurer requires payment in advance of all copayments,
coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so. (See also Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
pre-natal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits. Further, if a
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost
avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that
the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use
of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       43
<PAGE>
Contractor shall identify all potentially liable third parties and pursue
reimbursement from them except in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall
not pursue reimbursement in the following circumstances unless the case has been
referred to the Contractor by AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                  <C>
Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance            Adoption recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance            Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors                                          Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery
</TABLE>

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22- 1002 and R9-31-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In
joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs. AHCCCSA's
authorized representative is also responsible for negotiating and acting in the
best interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases
and may compromise a settlement in order to maximize overall reimbursement, net
of legal and other costs. For total plan cases involving only payments from the
Contractor, the Contractor is responsible for performing all research,
investigation, the filing of liens and payment of lien filing fees and other
related costs. The Contractor shall use the cover sheet as prescribed by AHCCCS
when filing liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a.       Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
         Contractor's financial liability for the member

b.       There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
         reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.)

c.       Such recovery is not prohibited by state or federal law

REPORTING: The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. In addition, upon AHCCCS's request, the Contractor shall
provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed
cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member's first and
last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount; paid/recovered amount;
and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide the format and reporting
schedule for this information to the Contractor. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working days of the
identification of a third-party liability case with known reinsurance (often
referred to as joint liability cases). The Contractor shall communicate any
known change in health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the
date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the
Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a complete
file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for the
purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA
of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by
AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE): Eligibility for KidsCare benefits requires that the
applicant/member not be enrolled with or entitled to any other health insurance
benefits. If the Contractor becomes aware of any such potential coverage, the
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. The Contractor shall follow the
same cost avoidance and postpayment recovery practices for the KidsCare
population as it does for the Title XIX population, and shall maintain a
reporting system which allows Title XIX and KidsCare information to be reported
separately.

<PAGE>
41.      MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligible". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. The Contractor is responsible for adhering to the cost sharing
responsibilities presented in the AHCCCS Medicare Cost Sharing policy. Effective
10/1/97, the Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare
payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same service of a
non-Medicare member.

42.      COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-711 and R9-31-711. In accordance with the
requirements mandated by the Balance Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor may not
collect copayments for family planning services.

43.      RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all reasonable times
during the term of this contract and the period set forth in paragraphs a. and
b. below any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by any
authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or federal government.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract except as provided
in paragraphs a. and b. below:

a.       If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records
         relating to the work terminated shall be preserved and made available
         for a period of five years from the date of any such termination.

b.       Records which relate to grievances, disputes, litigation or the
         settlement of claims arising out of the performance of this contract,
         or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has been
         taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of
         five years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44.      MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 working days
of receipt of request.

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical record is established
when information is received about a member. If the PCP has not yet seen the
member, such information may be kept temporarily in an appropriately labeled
file, in lieu of actually establishing a medical record, but must be associated
with the member's medical record as soon as one is established.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal

                                       45

<PAGE>
The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 working days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member if the reason for such request is directly related to the
administration of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed. (ARS ss.36-664I)

45.      ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the Office of Managed Care.

46.      ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSAs as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

47.      DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines which is available in the Bidder's Library. The information
so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all procedures,
policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this contract. If any
of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter
changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99
                                       46

<PAGE>

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted
input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for
any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous
input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
describes the specific technical and procedural requirements for interfaces
between AHCCCS and the Contractor and its subcontractors. The Contractor is
responsible for complying with all technical requirements as stated in this
manual as well as any subsequent changes to the manual. A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI): IN addition to the requirements outlined in
Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System, the Contractor will be required
to comply with all EDI standards which result from the Kennedy-Kassebaum
legislation. This law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
provide national electronic submission standards for health care data and may
include compliance with National Provider Identifier requirements. The Secretary
has 18 months to develop these standards. As the standards are finalized,
AHCCCSA will phase in the implementation. For encounter data transmissions, it
is anticipated that AHCCCS will make these standards available by March 1, 2000.
Effective October 1, 2000, the electronic standards will be required for
encounters. Electronic standards which may be implemented include, but are not
limited to, encounters, enrollment and capitation payments.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE: The Contractor shall undertake all appropriate planning
measures to ensure timely compliance with all Year 2000 requirements. In
addition, the Contractor shall develop contingency plans addressing alternative
processes to ensure that operations continue in the event that systems fail.

48.      ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance measures. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered services for
which the Contractor incurred a financial liability, including services provided
during prior period coverage. This requirement is a condition of the HCFA grant
award.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AMCCCSA-supplied formats. Formatting and specific
requirements for encounter data are described in the


                                                              Acute Care Renewal

<PAGE>
AHCCCS Encounter Reporting User Manual and the AHCCCS Technical Interface
Guidelines, copies of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter
Submission Requirements are included herein as Attachment I.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available to
AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim to an
adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found in The Encounter
User's Manual.

49.      MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and changes to
members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the Contractor
shall use to update its member records. The daily roster which is run prior to
the monthly roster is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate
code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end of every month.
The roster will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of
the first day of the next month. This roster contains the information used by
AHCCCSA to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month. The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly roster.
After reconciling the monthly roster information, the Contractor resumes posting
daily roster updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month.

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
available in the Bidder's Library for additional information.

50.      TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through 9/30/98. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the sole option to extend the term of the contract, not to
exceed a total contracting period of five years. The terms and conditions of any
such contract extension shall remain the same as the original contract, as
amended. Any contract extension, however, shall not affect the maximum
contracting period of five years. All contract extensions shall be through
contract amendment. If, in conjunction with a contract extension, AHCCCSA elects
to increase the capitation rate for any rate code category, such increase will
not exceed the inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another. Further,
AHCCCSA may require a contractor to renew all GSAs, or may terminate remaining
GSAs if the Contractor does not agree to renew all GSAS.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the provisions of such
extension will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the extension amendment has not been signed by the
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing
that it refuses to sign the extension amendment. If the Contractor provides such
notification, AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 120 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

51.      SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See policy on claims processing by
subcontracted providers in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing, and shall incorporate by
reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The following subcontracts
shall be submitted to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30
days prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.       Automated data processing

b.       Third-party administrators

c.       Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)

d.       Model subcontracts

e.       Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
         subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

See also Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement, regarding required
submission of hospital subcontracts.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts,
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is voidable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA. All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of federal and State laws,
regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider the
Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing services on its behalf more
than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions to this requirement include
the following:

a.       If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the
         contract year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the
         Contractor, the Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal
         to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt
         to gain such agreement.

b.       If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
         physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the

         applicable insurance coverage obligations which arise under this
         subcontract, for itself and its employees, and that AHCCSA shall have
         no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
         coverage.

         authorization from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to
         eligible and/or enrolled members.

n.       A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting
         and claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

52.      SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over and supersede existing and future subcontracts for services
that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving this
requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement for
transplant surgery exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty
contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts. AHCCCSA shall provide at
least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor prior to the
implementation of any specialty contract.

53.      MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA Contracting Office as described in
Section D, Paragraph 51, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must be submitted
with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or corporate
allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are determined to
be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment to the
Contractor, the Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or
financial sanctions may be imposed.


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

<PAGE>
54.      MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a consultant or actuary
are less than $50,000, AHCCCSA will waive the requirement for an audit of that
consultant or actuary.

55.      MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 15 days after contract
award.

Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSAs, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSAs awarded. This requirement is in addition to the
Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57 below and must be
met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirements may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA that
they are currently servicing must meet the equity per member standard (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) for their current
membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must fund
through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet this requirement.
Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional
capitalization for the new GSA they are bidding. (See the table of requirements
by GSA above). Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their
existing membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $5,000,000 in equity.

56.      PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       51

<PAGE>
Contractor's obligations to providers, non-contracting providers, and
non-providers; and (2) performance by the Contractor of its obligations under
this contract. The Performance Bond shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as
described in the AHCCCS Performance Bond policy available in the Office of
Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.       Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers
         and nonproviders by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations
         under this contract,

b.       Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
         Contractor, and

c.       Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses
         incurred by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
         this contract, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after
         termination of this contract for reasons other than the convenience of
         the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor may not change
the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without prior written
approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

57.      AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid in the month of October 1997, or as
determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include SOBRA
supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied by the Contractor not
later than 15 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the amount required.
Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics of the Contractor
on a monthly basis. If there is an increase in capitation payment that exceeds
10% of the performance bond amount, AHCCCSA may require an increase in the
amount of the Performance Bond. The Contractor shall have 15 days following
notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Performance Bond amount that must be maintained after the contract term shall be
sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by
AHCCCSA. The Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond
without prior written approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

58.      FINANCIAL VIABILITY CRITERIA/ PERFORMANCE MEASURES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability criteria/performance
goals:

CURRENT RATIO                      Current assets divided by current
                                   liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
                                   long-term investments that can be converted
                                   to cash within 24 hours without significant
                                   penalty (i.e., greater than 20%).

                                   STANDARD:  AT LEAST 1.00


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       52
<PAGE>
EQUITY PER MEMBER                  Equity, less on-balance sheet performance
                                   bond, divided by the number of non-SOBRA
                                   Family Planning Extension Services members
                                   enrolled at the end of the period.

                                   STANDARD: AT LEAST $150

                                   (Failure to meet this standard may result in
                                   an enrollment cap being imposed in any or all
                                   contracted GSA.)

MEDICAL EXPENSE RATIO              Total medical expenses (net of reinsurance,
                                   TPL, HIV/AIDS Supplement) divided by total
                                   capitation + SOBRA.

                                   STANDARD:  AT LEAST 85%

ADMINISTRATIVE COST                Total administrative expenses (excluding
PERCENTAGE:                        income taxes), divided by total capitation +
                                   SOBRA + TPL + reinsurance + HIV/AIDS
                                   Supplement

                                   STANDARD:  NO MORE THAN 10%

RECEIVED BUT UNPAID                Received but unpaid claims divided by the
CLAIMS (DAYS                       average daily medical expenses for the
OUTSTANDING)                       period, net of sub-capitation expense

                                   STANDARD:  NO MORE THAN 30 DAYS

59.      MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract
amendment. The Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or
transition plan to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review. The purpose of
the plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new
entity's ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to
members are not diminished and that major components of the organization and
AHCCCS programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or
change in ownership.

60.      SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or terminate this contract or any
related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-405 and R9-31-405 and
the terms of this contract and applicable federal or State law and regulations.
AHCCCSA may, in addition to these remedies, impose monetary sanctions if the
Contractor violates any provision stated in law or this contract in accordance
with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-406 and R9-31-406 and the provisions of this contract,
applicable federal or State law and regulations. Written notice will be provided
to the Contractor specifying the sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such
sanction and either the length of suspension or the amount of capitation
prepayment to be withheld. The Contractor may appeal the decision to impose a
sanction in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-804.

In addition to the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose partial or
full enrollment caps on the Contractor. Among the contract violations that may
result in an enrollment cap are, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Marketing violations

b.       Failure to meet AHCCCS financial viability standards

c.       Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network

d.       Quality of care and quality management issues

e.       Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards

CURE NOTICE PROCESS: Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       53

<PAGE>
period of time during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into
compliance with contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time
period, the Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA
will take no further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with
the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of
sanctions.

61.      AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to contractors
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm favors those
contractors with lower capitation rates. For further details on the AHCCCS
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change the
algorithm at any time during the term of the contract and frequently does so in
response to contractor-specific issues of non-compliance (e.g. imposition of an
enrollment cap). The Contractor should consider this in preparing its response
to this RFP. AHCCCSA is not obligated to adjust for any financial impacts this
may have on the Contractor.

62.      GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers, which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. This written policy shall be in accordance with applicable federal
and State law and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not limited to, AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22-802; R9-31-802; R9-22-804 and R9-31-803.
The grievance process may not be delegated or subcontracted outside of the
health plan. Refer to Attachment H for a complete description of grievance
process requirements.

63.      QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly Grievance Report Format on file in the
Bidder's Library. The Quarterly Grievance Report must be received by the
AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance, no later than 45 days from the end of the
quarter.

64.      KIDSCARE

On November 1, 1998, AHCCCSA implemented a Title XXI Children's Health Insurance
Program, referred to as "KidsCare". KidsCare provides health care coverage
statewide to eligible children 18 and younger and is provided through the
existing AHCCCS health plans, state employee HMOs that elect to participate, and
tribal facilities or Indian Health Service for Native Americans who elect to
receive services through them. Services will also be directly provided by
participating community health clinics and hospitals which predominantly serve
low income children.

The KidsCare service package is established by the legislature and approved by
HCFA through the State Plan. Services, limitations and exclusions are described
in Section D, Paragraph 1, Scope of Services. Capitation rates payable to the
Contractor for KidsCare members (age 18 and younger) will be set by AHCCCSA in
conjunction with an independent actuary.

Effective October 1,1999, KidsCare members in families with gross household
income over 150% and up to 200% of the federal poverty limit shall pay a premium
to AHCCCSA. The premium amount shall be based on the number of members in the
household and the gross family income in accordance with 9A.A.A.C., Article 14.

TITLE XXI PARENT/GUARDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: ARS ss.36.2984 mandates
that the Contractor offer health insurance coverage to the parent(s) or legal
guardian(s) of a child who is eligible for Title XXI. The Contractor shall
establish rates for this coverage which must be approved by AHCCCSA, Office of
Managed


                                                              Acute Care Renewal
                                                                 Revised 10/1/99

                                       54

<PAGE>

Care, prior to implementation. Title XXI funds or any other federal or state
funds shall not be used to subsidize family coverage. The full cost of the
premium shall be paid by the parent or legal guardian who elects this coverage.
The Contractor may include provisions for pre-existing conditions and any other
medical underwriting considerations that are necessary to protect it from
adverse risk. For further information, refer to the Title XXI Parent/Guardian
Health Insurance Coverage Guidelines on file in the Bidder's Library.

65.      PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

In addition to the requirements described in this RFP, there are several
legislative issues that could have an impact on services provided by the
Contractor on or after October 1, 1998. The following is a brief description of
the issues that AHCCCS is aware of at the time of the issuance of this renewal
amendment:

ELIGIBILITY BASED ON 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL): Through a
successful initiative effort, eligibility for AHCCCS has been expanded to allow
persons with income up to 100% of the FPL to become eligible for the Medicaid
program. Legislative action will be required to implement this new eligibility
guideline and HCFA must approve the expansion. If HCFA approval is granted,
there will be a significant number of new persons who will be eligible for the
program and enrolled with the health plans at some future date.

Subcontractor, or any agent or representative of the Subcontractor, to any
officer or employee of the State with a view towards securing a contract or
securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding, amending or the
making of any determinations with respect to the performance of the
Subcontractor; provided, that the existence of the facts upon which the state
makes such findings shall be in issue and may be reviewed in any competent
court. If the subcontract is terminated under this section, unless the Program
Contractor is a governmental agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof,
AHCCCSA shall be entitled to a penalty, in addition to any other damages to
which it may be entitled by


                                      A-3

By signing this subcontract, the Subcontractor certifies that all
representations set forth herein are true to the best of its knowledge.

21.      CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE - ANTI-KICKBACK AND LABORATORY TESTING

By signing this subcontract, the Subcontractor certifies that it has not engaged

provider registration process. Failure to do so shall result in either a
termination of an active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

other applicable insurance coverage, for itself and its employees, and AHCCCSA
shall have no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
coverage.

fraud or abuse has occurred, the Subcontractor shall report the incident to the
Program Contractor, who shall proceed in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plans
and Program Contractors Policy for Prevention, Detection and Reporting of Fraud

                     ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS

                          (By Geographic Service Area)


INSTRUCTIONS:


Note:    Offerors are permitted to bid only by Geographic Service Area. Please
see Section H, Paragraph 9, Award of Contracts, for further information on
bidding by Geographic Service Area.

Offerors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of meeting
contract requirements. The information that follows describes the minimum
network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA). The minimum bid is a
single entire GSA, as depicted on the following page.

In some GSA's there are required service sites located outside of the
geographical boundary of a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical access
to care. In certain instances, a member must travel a much greater distance to
receive services within their assigned GSA if the member were not allowed to
receive services in an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which straddle
two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these zip codes is
based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip code has been assigned by
AHCCCS. The Offeror shall be responsible for providing services to members
residing in the entire zip code that is assigned to the GSA for which the
Offeror has agreed to provide services. The split zip codes GSA assignments are
as follows:

<PAGE>

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, and pediatrics) are not
included in the primary care provider contract, at least one subcontract is
required for each of these specialties in the service sites specified. General
surgeons must be available within 50 miles of service sites.

In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Offeror must
demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that
members don't need to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific to
GSA #6.

Offerors bidding in GSA's other than GSA 10 and GSA 12 are encouraged to
contract with the hospitals in their provider network. However, AHCCCSA will not
award additional points in the evaluation process for hospital contracts in
rural areas. At a minimum, the Offeror shall have a physician with admitting and
treatment privileges with each hospital in its network. Offerors bidding in GSA
10 and/or GSA 12 must have at least one hospital contract in each service
district as depicted on the respective maps for GSA 10 and GSA 12. This
requirement is part of the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program, described more
fully in Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement. For offerors'
convenience, a list of Phoenix and Tucson area hospitals are included on the
reverse of the Phoenix and Tucson maps which follow.

Provider categories required at various service delivery sites included in the
Service Area Minimum Network Standards are indicated as follows:

         H        Hospitals
         P        Primary Care Providers (physicians, certified nurse
                  practitioners and physician assistants)
         D        Dentists
         PH       Pharmacies

<PAGE>

ATTACHMENT H:  GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. The Contractor shall also ensure compliance with the Members' Rights
and Responsibilities Policy. The written grievance policy shall be in accordance
with applicable federal and State laws and AHCCCS Rules and policy including,
but not limited to, AHCCCS Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22-802; and
R9-22-804. The grievance policy shall include the following provisions:

a.       The grievance procedure will be provided all subcontractors at time of
         contract, and to non-contracting providers within 10 days of the date
         of receipt of the claim. For non-contracting providers, the grievance
         procedure may be mailed with the remittance advice provided the
         remittance is sent within 45 days of receipt of claim.

b.       Specific individual(s) are appointed with authority to require
         corrective action to administer the grievance policy.

c.       A log is maintained for all grievances containing sufficient
         information to identify the grievant, date of receipt, nature of the
         grievance and the date grievance is resolved. Separate logs must be
         maintained for provider and member grievances. The logs must contain
         sufficient information to identify the grievant, date of receipt,
         nature of the grievance and the date grievance is resolved.

d.       Within five working days of receipt, the grievant is informed by letter
         that the grievance has been received. The letter must also be in a
         second language when 200 members or 5% of the Contractor's population,
         whichever is greater speak the second language.

e.       Each grievance is thoroughly investigated using the applicable
         statutory, regulatory and contractual provisions as well as the
         Contractor's policies and procedures, ensuring that facts are gathered
         from all parties.

f.       All documentation received and mailed by Contractor during the
         grievance process is dated upon date of receipt.

g.       All grievances are filed in a secure, designated area and are
         retained for five years following the final decision, judicial appeal
         or close of a grievance.

h.       A copy of the Contractor's final decision will be either hand-delivered
         or delivered by certified mail to all parties whose interest has been
         adversely affected by the decision. The final decision shall be mailed
         to all other individuals by regular mail. The date of the final
         decision shall be the date of personal delivery or, if mailed, the
         postmark date of the mailing. The final decision must include, and
         describe in detail, the following:

                  1.       the nature of the grievance

                  2.       the issues involved

                  3.       the reasons supporting the Contractor's decision
                           including references to applicable statute, rule and
                           procedure

                  4.       the grievant's right to appeal the Contractor's
                           decision to AHCCCSA by filing the appeal to the
                           Contractor no later than 15 days after the date of
                           the Contractor's final decision. This must also be
                           written in a second language, if applicable.

i.       If the Contractor's final decision is appealed, all supporting
         documentation must be received by the AHCCCSA, Office of Legal
         Assistance no later than five working days from the date the Contractor
         receives the appeal or from the date of the oral or written request
         from AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance. The appeal file must contain
         a cover letter that includes:

                  1.       grievant's name

                  2.       grievant's AHCCCS ID number


<PAGE>

                  3.       grievant's address

                  4.       phone number (if applicable)

                  5.       date of receipt of grievance and appeal

                  6.       summary of the Contractor's actions undertaken to
                           resolve the grievance and basis thereof

j.       The following material shall be included in the appeal file:

                  1.       written request of the grievant asking for the appeal

                  2.       copies of the entire file which include the
                           investigations and/or medical records; and the
                           Contractor's grievance decision

                  3.       other information used by the Contractor to resolve
                           the grievance and that would be necessary to AHCCCSA
                           to resolve the grievance.

k.       The Contractor may attempt to use alternative resolution procedures to
         resolve disputes presented to the Contractor verbally or in writing. If
         the Contractor elects to use an alternative resolution process, it must
         be administered and completed within 10 days from receipt of the
         dispute. If the matter is not resolved to the grievant's satisfaction
         within the 10 day period, the dispute must then be adjudicated using
         the grievance standards contained above. However, the Contractor must
         render the written grievance decision within a maximum of 30 days from
         the date of the initial filing of the grievance or dispute unless a
         longer period was agreed to by the parties involved.

l.       For all disputes where an alternative resolution is proposed, the
         Contractor must maintain a separate log, complying with paragraphs c.
         and g. above.

7.       The above referenced contract is hereby modified as follows:

In Section D, Program Requirements, on page 40 of the October 1, 1999 revision
of the contract the paragraph entitled "Reconciliation of PPC Costs to
Reimbursement" is changed as follows:

Reconciliation of PPC Costs to Reimbursement: For CYE '98 and CYE '99, AHCCCSA
will offer a reconciliation process for contractors whose total PPC medical cost
experience (excluding administrative and non-operating expenses) is more than
10% higher than the reimbursement associated with PPC in two areas: the "retro"
portion of the capitation rate for all rate categories, and the prospective
three-day notification period for MNMI recipients only. Expenses will be net of
reinsurance for both the retro and prospective periods.

AHCCCSA will reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable costs in excess
of a 10% limit as determined by reported encounters. AHCCCS will recoup profit
amounts in excess of a 10% limit.

___ CYE '00, a full reconciliation to 0% profit or loss will be done by AHCCCSA
for the same eligibility time periods and risk group noted above. AHCCCSA will
reimburse the health plans 100% of any excess reasonable costs as determined by
reported encounters, and all profits will be recouped. Refer to the Office of
Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further details of the
reconciliation process.

                         SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1.       SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 2, the AHCCCS Medical Policy
Manual (AMPM), and the document entitled "AHCCCS Health Plan Performance
Indicators", all of which are incorporated herein by reference and may be found
in the Bidder's Library. The covered services are briefly described below.
Covered services must be medically necessary and provided by, or coordinated
with, a primary care provider, except for behavioral health and children's
preventive dental services. Services must be rendered by providers that are
appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their scope of practice,
and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall provide the same
standard of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

KIDS CARE COVERED SERVICES: KidsCare members are eligible for the same services
covered for members under the Title XIX and state-only programs, with the
following differences, exclusions and/or limitations:

a.       Non-emergency transportation is not covered.
b.       Chiropractic services are not covered.
c.       Vision services are limited to one eye examination per contract year
         and one pair of glasses or contacts every contract year.
d.       EPSDT services are limited to those services specified in this
         contract.
e.       Behavioral health services are limited to 30 inpatient days and 30
         outpatient visits per contract year. (See details under Section D
         Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.)
f.       Licensed midwives and home deliveries are not covered.

For further details regarding the KidsCare program, see Section D, Paragraph 64,
KidsCare, and the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM).

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a freestanding surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through other than medical or surgical means
(i.e. hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.



                                       12

CHILDRENS REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-22, Article 2
A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3.. Eligibility criteria and the referral
process are described in the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual available in the
Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall monitor referrals to CRS to ensure CRS covered services are
provided in a timely manner to eligible members. Referral to CRS does not
relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for providing medically necessary
services not covered by CRS to CRS eligible members. The Contractor is also
responsible for initial care of newborn members, who are CRS eligible. The
Contractor must require the member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) to coordinate
their care with the CRS program. All services provided must be included in the
member's medical record maintained by the PCP.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS. If the member
uses their private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, and the member
is not enrolled with CRS, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable
deductibles and copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered
services to its members. If the Contractor becomes aware that CRS has failed to
meet the established appointment standards, or has failed to provide medically
necessary CRS covered services, the Contractor shall immediately notify AHCCCSA,
Office of Medical Management, of the occurrence. In accordance with AHCCCS
policy, the Contractor may seek reimbursement from CRS for providing CRS covered
services.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
Title XIX members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved
by the Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition.
Medicare approved chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to
limitations specified in CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if
prescribed by the member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

DENTAL: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services; dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the AHCCCS periodicity
schedule; therapeutic dental services; dentures; and pretransplantation dental
services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance with the EPSDT periodicity
schedule for dental screening services and ensure that dental service reports
are included in the member's medical record maintained by the PCP. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Measures. The Contractor shall
ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the member
has not been scheduled for a visit. If no dental screening is received by the
member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may request
dental services without referral and may choose a dental provider from the
Contractor's provider network. For members who are 21 years of age and older,
the Contractor shall provide emergency dental care, medically necessary dentures
and dental services for transplantation services as specified in the AMPM.
Dental standards may be found in the AMPM, Section 310, which is incorporated
herein by reference and which may be found in the Bidder's Library.


                                       13
<PAGE>


DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease
(ESRD) providers. Services may be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an
inpatient basis if the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic
dialysis services.

EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT (EPSDT): The Contractor
shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment to correct or
ameliorate defects and physical or mental illness discovered by the screenings
for members under age 21. The Contractor shall ensure that these members receive
required health screenings, including developmental/behavioral health, in
compliance with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule (Exhibit 430-1 in the AMPM) and
to submit to the AHCCCS Office of Medical Management, all EPSDT reports as
required by AHCCCS medical policy. The Contractor is required to meet specific
participation/utilization rates for members as described in Section D, Paragraph
16, Performance Measures. Because the behavioral health benefit for Title XIX
and Title XXI is provided through the ADHS/RBHA system, the Contractor shall
ensure the initiation and coordination of the referral of these members to the
RBHA and shall follow up with the RBHA to monitor whether members have received
behavioral health services. Title XXI members are not entitled to the
all-encompassing EPSDT service package required for Title XIX children. Title
XXI children are entitled only to the EPSDT and other covered services specified
in this document, the AMPM and the Title XXI State Plan.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

a.       Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
         professionals to provide prehospital, emergency care on a
         24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
         emergent condition as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-101 and R9-31-101.
         Emergency medical services are covered without prior authorization. The
         Contractor is encouraged to contract with emergency service facilities
         for the provision of emergency services. The Contractor is encouraged
         to contract with or employ the services of non-emergency facilities
         (e.g. urgent care centers) to address member non-emergency care issues
         occurring after regular office hours or on weekends. The Contractor
         shall be responsible for educating members and providers regarding
         appropriate utilization of emergency room services including behavioral
         health emergencies. The Contractor shall monitor emergency service
         utilization (by both provider and member) and shall have guidelines for
         implementing corrective action for inappropriate utilization. For
         utilization review, the test for appropriateness of the request for
         emergency services shall be whether a prudent layperson, similarly
         situated, would have requested such services. For purposes of this
         contract, a "prudent layperson" is a person who possesses an average
         knowledge of health and medicine.
b.       All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition
c.       Emergency transportation
d.       Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
         assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent
         situations, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
e.       The Contractor shall comply with guidelines regarding the coordination
         of post-stabilization care.

beginning of this section, titled "KidsCare Covered Services." For members who
are 21 years of age and older, the Contractor shall provide emergency care for
eye conditions which meet the definition of an emergency medical condition,
cataract removal, and/or medically necessary vision examinations and
prescriptive lenses if required following cataract removal and other eye

counseling necessary to allow the members to make informed decisions regarding
family planning methods shall also be included. If the Contractor does not
provide family planning services, it must contract for these services through

selecting a provider. A prospective offeror may discuss arrangements for family
planning services only with other prospective offerors during the RFP process
for the purpose of making arrangements for the provision of family planning
services.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family Planning
Services Extension Program; a program that provides only family planning

than renting or purchasing another unit.

NURSING FACILITY: The Contractor shall provide nursing facility services,
including religious nonmedical health care institutions, for members who require

residing in a nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this
contract. If the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS
Program Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility
coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage
during the time the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing facility
services covered by a third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member
is enrolled with the Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day limitation. See
Paragraph 36, Nursing Facility Reimbursement, for further details.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the stay
goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

NUTRITION: Nutritional assessments may be conducted as a part of the EPSDT
screenings for members under age 21, and to assist members 21 years of age and
older whose health status may improve with nutritional intervention. Assessment

4.       VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of the Social
Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program which became
effective 10/1/94. Through this program, the federal and state governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. Therefore, the Contractor shall not utilize AHCCCS
funding to purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19. Any provider,
licensed by the State to administer immunizations, may register with ADHS as a
"VFC provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall comply with all
VFC requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if providing
immunizations to AHCCCS members under the age of 19, the providers are
registered with ADHS/VFC.

                                        Title XXI program.

Arizona's 15 Counties                   Each county determines eligibility for
                                        the Medically Needy/Medically Indigent
                                        (MN/MI), Eligible Low Income Children
                                        (ELIC), and the State Emergency Services
                                        state programs.


AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9-22, Article 17.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

Acute members, except for those eligible under the MN/MI program have a choice
of available health plans. A listing of the available health plans and their
telephone numbers will be given to each applicant during the application process
for AHCCCS benefits. Also included are instructions to applicants to call the
health plans directly with specific questions concerning the health plan. If
there is only one health plan available for the applicant's Geographical Service
Area, no choice is offered. Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA' s being
notified of their eligibility are automatically assigned to a health plan based
on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm.

Title XXI members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned. When a member is transferred from
Title XIX to Title XXI and has not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the
member will remain with the Title XIX health plan and a choice notice will be
sent to the member. The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from
the date the choice notice is sent.

AHCCCSA assigns MN/MI members to an available health plan based on family
continuity or through AHCCCSA's auto-assignment algorithm. These members do not
get a choice of available contractors until their annual enrollment choice
period.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX and state-only members
include: previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90
days will be automatically enrolled with the same contractor, if that contractor
is still available. Also, women who are eligible for the Family Planning
Services Extension Program will automatically remain assigned to the same health
plan. The Family Planning Services Extension Program provides a maximum of 24
months of family planning services.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX or state-only member with
the Contractor will generally be the day prior to the date the Contractor
receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily roster. However, the Contractor
is responsible for payment of medically necessary covered services retroactive
to the member's beginning date of eligibility, excluding any prior quarter
coverage period.



                                       23
<PAGE>

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member will be the first day of
the month following notification to the health plan. If a Title XXI member is
determined eligible by the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled with
the health plan as of the 1st of the following month. If the member is
determined eligible AFTER the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled
with the health plan as of the 1st of the second following month.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for Title XIX and
state-only members. For Title XIX members, prior period coverage starts from the
first day of the month of application, or first eligible month, whichever is
later. The Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically
necessary covered services provided to Title XIX members during prior period
coverage. For state-only EAC members, prior period coverage does not apply. For
state-only MN/MI and ELIC members prior period coverage is generally limited to
the two days prior to the date of AHCCCSA being notified of eligibility.
However, prior period coverage could include additional days prior to the date
of enrollment. The Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for
medically necessary covered services provided on an emergency basis to
state-only members pursuant to A.R.S. ss. 36-2908 and A.R.S. ss. 36-2909 for the
first two days of the prior period coverage. Any additional prior period
coverage for state-only members will include all claims for medically necessary
covered services. This may include services provided prior to the contract year.
(See Section D, Paragraph 37, Compensation, for a description of the
Contractor's reimbursement from AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers, including Title XXI mothers,
who were enrolled at the time of the child's birth and whose newborn
notification was received by AHCCCSA will be enrolled with the mother's health
plan. The Contractor is responsible for notifying AHCCCSA of a child's birth to
an enrolled member. Capitation to the Contractor will begin on the date
notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of births during prior
period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the newborn's
date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered services to the
newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification of the child's birth.
Note that AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification calls 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. Title XIX and Title XXI eligible mothers of newborns are
sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for
their child; otherwise the child will remain with the mother's contractor.
Newborns of MN/MI mothers are enrolled with the mother's contractor for a
minimum of 30 days up to a maximum of 60 days.

Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a health plan and mothers of these
newborns are sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different
health plan for their child. In the event the FES mother chooses a different
health plan, AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned
plan and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of birth in the
second plan. The second plan will receive prior period capitation from the date
of birth to the day before assignment and prospective capitation from the date
of assignment forward. The second contractor will be responsible for all covered
services to the newborn from date of birth.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, or as an Eligible Assistance Child (EAC), the member is guaranteed a
minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Upon initial capitated
enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of
12 full months of continuous enrollment. Enrollment guarantees do not apply to
Native Americans who choose to obtain their covered services through Indian
Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service basis or children enrolled with


                                       24
<PAGE>

Department of Economic Security/Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program. The
enrollment guarantee applies a maximum of one time per member per eligibility
category for Title XIX, Title XXI and EAC members. If a member changes from one
contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of
the guarantee period applies to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may
not be granted or may be terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor
child is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22, Article 17 and R9-31, Article 3 describes
other reasons for which the enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS. Native Americans eligible under any coverage group other than
MN/MI, on or off-reservation, have a choice to receive services from Indian
Health Service (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility or any available contractor.
If choice is not available or made within the specified time limit, Native
American Title XIX and state-only members living on-reservation will be assigned
to IHS and Native American Title XIX and state-only members living
off-reservation will be assigned to an available contractor using AHCCCSA's
family continuity policy and auto-assignment algorithm. Native Americans may
change from IHS to a contractor or from a contractor to IHS at any time. Native
American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being determined
eligible.

7.       MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, or physical or mental handicap, except where
medically indicated. Contractors must take into account a member's culture, when
addressing members and their concerns, and must take reasonable steps to
encourage subcontractors to do the same. The Contractor must make interpreters
available for members to ensure appropriate delivery of covered services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
         available facility.
b.       Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
         provided in a different manner or at a different time from that
         provided to other members, other public or private patients or the
         public at large except where medically necessary.
c.       Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
         related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in
         any way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed
         by others receiving any covered service.
d.       The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the
         basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
         ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
         membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
         served.

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e. the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.


                                       25
<PAGE>

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

8.       MEMBER INFORMATION

All informational materials prepared by the Contractor shall be approved by
AHCCCSA prior to distribution to members. The reading level and name of the
evaluation methodology used should be included when 200 members or 5% of the
Contractor's enrolled population, whichever is greater, speak a 2nd language,
the Contractor shall provide member information in that 2nd language. The
Contractor shall comply whenever it is aware that a population meets this
standard. When there are program or service site changes notification will be
provided to the affected members at least 14 days before implementation. The
Contractor shall review and update the Member Handbook at least once a year. The
Handbook must be submitted to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care for approval by
Sept. 1 of each contract year, or within four weeks of receiving the annual
renewal amendment, whichever is later.

The Contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all information prepared
for distribution to members is written at a 4th grade level.

                  covered services (other than applicable copayments), what to

surveys will become public information and available to all interested parties
upon request. In addition, unless waived by AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall
perform its own annual general or focused member survey. All such contractor
surveys must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.

         relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification of the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related

the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and for
providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions of how to obtain services.

         of this contract and for which the Contractor would otherwise be liable

         health agency, hospice or organization responsible for providing
         personal care must comply with federal and State law regarding advance
         directives for adult members. Requirements include:

         (1)      Maintaining written policies that address the rights of adult
                  members to make decisions about medical care, including the
                  right to accept or refuse medical care, and the right to

         (4)      Not discriminating against a member because of his or her
                  decision to execute or not execute an advance directive, and
                  not making it a condition for the provision of care.
         (5)      Providing education to staff on issues concerning advance
                  directives including notification of direct care providers of
                  services, such as home health care and personal care, of any

16.      PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

All performance measures described below apply to Title XIX, Title XXI, and
state-only member populations.

Effective October 1, 2000, AHCCCS will require Contractors to adopt the Quality
Improvement System for Managed Care (QISMC). AHCCCS will work with the
Contractors to develop quality improvement projects that will meet the QISMC
guidelines. Compliance with this requirement will become a part of the
Operational and Financial Review after October 1, 2001.

Contractors shall strive to meet the AHCCCS stated performance measure goals.
However, it is equally important that Contractors continually improve their
performance measure outcomes from year to year. Improvement in performance is to
be measured by a reduction in the health plan's adverse outcomes. AHCCCS
requires the Contractor to achieve a reduction of ten percent or more from the
previous year's adverse outcomes. The Contractor's performance will also be
evaluated against the adjusted AHCCCS statewide average performance level,
excluding the effect of the Contractor's data.


                                       33
<PAGE>

AHCCCS will require the Contractor to have a quality improvement plan in place
when:

(a)      the Contractor has not achieved the AHCCCS statewide performance level
         for any measure but has shown significant improvement, or
(b)      the Contractor's rate has declined but is at or above the AHCCCS
         statewide performance level for any measure.

The Contractor will be required to submit a corrective action plan and may be
subject to sanctions if:

(a)      the Contractor has not achieved the AHCCCS statewide performance level
         for any measure and has failed to show adequate improvement, or
(b)      if the Contractor's rate has declined and fallen below the AHCCCS
         statewide performance level for any measure.

Corrective action plans must be received by the Office of Medical Management
within 30 days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS. AHCCCS may conduct one or
more follow-up on-site reviews to verify compliance with a corrective action
plan.

EPSDT PARTICIPATION: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program to at least 80% of all enrolled
members under age 21 during CYE 2001. The participant rate is the number of
children receiving at least one medical screen compared to the number of
children expected to receive at least one medical screen. The number of children
expected to receive at least one medical screen is based on the federal
periodicity schedule and the average period of eligibility.

AHCCCSA will measure participation levels through encounter data and will not
use information from prior period coverage (see Paragraph D.6, Prior Period
Coverage) in evaluating the Contractor's performance.

EPSDT IMMUNIZATIONS: The Contractor shall ensure members under age 21 receive
age-appropriate immunizations as specified in the AMPM. During CYE 2001, the
Contractor shall meet or exceed the following:

         services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
         referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational
audits. PCPs and specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's
members shall have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one
general acute care hospital that is located within the Contractor's service
area.

23.      OTHER PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to:

a.       Recruit sufficient specialty physicians, dentists, health care
         professionals, health care institutions and support services to meet
         the medical needs of its members.
b.       Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
         network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of
         care to members with limited proficiency in English.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.


                                       40
<PAGE>

For specialty services, the Contractor shall ensure that:

a.       PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except
         that women shall have direct access to GYN providers without a referral
         for preventive and routine services. Any waiver of this requirement by
         the Contractor must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.
b.       Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a
         medical condition other than that for which the member was referred,
         unless approved by the member's PCP.
c.       The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP complete
         documentation of all diagnostic services including copies of test
         results if applicable, treatment services provided and the resulting
         outcome for each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.       Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are
         general practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics
b.       Certified nurse midwives
c.       Licensed midwives.

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric care (physician
or certified nurse midwife). Such assignment shall be consistent with the
freedom of choice requirements for selecting health care professionals while
ensuring that the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a
PCP for medical care as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges. Licensed midwives perform deliveries only in the member's
home. Labor and delivery services may also be provided in the member's home by
physicians and certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.

24.      NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient personnel for the
provision of covered services, including emergency medical care on a
24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall be sufficient to
provide covered services within designated time and distance limits. For
Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that 95% of its
members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson do
not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP or pharmacy. 95% of its
members residing outside the boundary area must not have to travel more than 10
miles to see such providers. See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for
details on network requirements by Geographic Service Area. Also see Section D,
Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for details on changes
in hospital subcontracting effective October 1, 1998.


                                       41
<PAGE>

Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall not discriminate
with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program, reimbursement or
indemnification against any provider based solely on the provider's type of
licensure or certification. This provision, however, does not prohibit the
Contractor from limiting provider participation to the extent necessary to meet
the needs of the Contractor's members. This provision also does not interfere
with measures established by the Contractor to control costs consistent with its
responsibilities under this contract.

25.      NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertains to all
service specifications described in the AMPM Chapters 300, 600 and 900. In
addition, the Contractor shall have policies on how the Contractor will:

a.       Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program
         changes and requirements
b.       Monitor and control network compliance with policies and rules of
         AHCCCSA and the Contractor, including compliance with all policies and
         procedures related to the grievance process and ensuring the member's
         care is not compromised during the grievance process.
c.       Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network
d.       Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
         network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service
         area
e.       Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient providers
         to handle the volume of members
f.       Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring appointment
         procedures standards, appointment waiting times, and service provision
         standards

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one,
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract. The
Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned material changes in the
provider network before the change process has begun, for example before issuing
a 60-day termination notice to a provider. The notification shall be made within
one working day if the change is unexpected. AHCCCSA will assess proposed
changes in the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members'
health care and provide a written response to the Contractor within 14 days of
receipt of request. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care if the provider network change is likely to result in
deficient delivery of covered services.

26.      FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the federal mandates. This legislation gives FQHCs the
option to require state Medicaid programs to reimburse the FQHC at 100% of
reasonable costs for the services delivered to Title XIX members. AHCCCSA and
its contractors are required to comply with this legislation. The following
payment methodology for reasonable cost reimbursement was implemented effective
October 1, 1997.

If the FQHC elects reasonable cost reimbursement, the FQHC will receive a
quarterly payment per Title XIX member per month from AHCCCSA. The initial
capitation amount will be $1.75 PMPM statewide. In accordance with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 and BBA Refinements Legislation, this additional
reimbursement will be phased out over a five-year period beginning in contract
year ending 2000:

<TABLE>

          2001                         95%              $ 1.66
          2002                         95%              $ 1.66
          2003                         90%              $ 1.58
          2004                         85%              $ 1.49
          2005                          0%              $ 0.00
</TABLE>

Contractors are required to submit member month information for Title XIX
members for each FQHC on a quarterly basis to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care.
AHCCCSA will perform periodic audits of the member month information submitted.
Contractors should refer to the Office of Managed Care's policy on FQHC
reimbursement for further guidance. The following FQHCs are currently recognized
by HCFA:

         Ajo Community Health Center
         Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc.
         Clinica Adelante, Inc.
         El Rio Health Center
         Inter-Tribal Health Care Center
         Lake Powell Medical Center
         Marana Health Center
         Mariposa Community Health Center, Inc.
         Mountain Park Health Center
         Native American Community Health Center, Inc.
         Native Americans for Community Action Family Health Center
         North Country Community Health Center
         Sun Life Family Health Center
         Sunset Community Health Center (formerly Valley Health Center, Inc.)
         United Community Health Center, Inc.


                                       43
<PAGE>

Any other clinics that subsequently become FQHCS will be subject to the
reimbursement methodology described above upon electing reasonable cost
reimbursement from AHCCCSA.

27.      PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number. A
Provider Participation Agreement must be signed with each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

28.      PROVIDER AFFILIATION TAPE

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Tape User Manual on October 15, January 15, April 15, and
July 15 of each contract year. The Manual may be found in the Bidder's Library.

29.      PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its HCFA grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

a.       Timeliness:       Reports or other required data shall be received on
                           or before scheduled due dates.

b.       Accuracy:         Reports or other required data shall be prepared in
                           strict conformity with appropriate authoritative
                           sources and/or AHCCCS defined standards.

c.       Completeness:     All required information shall be fully disclosed
                           in a manner that is both responsive and pertinent
                           to report intent with no material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.



                                       44
<PAGE>

30.      DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA, or the federal government, to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials that are produced by the Contractor and refer
to covered services shall state that such services are funded under contract
with AHCCCSA.

31.      REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.

32.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business for the initial contract year beginning 10/1/97.
The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess new contractors' readiness and
ability to provide contract services to members at the start of the contract
year. A new contractor will be permitted to commence operations only if the
Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's satisfaction.

33.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with HCFA requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular Operational
and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not limited to) ensuring
operational and financial program compliance. The Reviews will identify areas
where improvements can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and provide the
Contractor with technical assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply
with all other medical audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and
R9-3l-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel as identified in advance shall be
available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA if the


                                       45
<PAGE>

Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA or any other nationally
recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the entire NCQA report
to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and Financial Review
Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior to
AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review findings
may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with federal, State, AIHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements must be implemented by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to
determine the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations and
achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be conducted at any time
after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

34.      CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-705, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. In the absence
of a subcontract provision to the contrary, claims submission deadlines shall be
calculated from the date of service or the effective date of eligibility
posting, whichever is later. Remittance advices accompanying the Contractor's
payments to providers must contain, at a minimum, adequate descriptions of all
denials and adjustments, the reasons for such denials and adjustments, the
amount billed, the amount paid, and grievance and request for hearing rights.
The Contractor's claims payment system, as well as its prior authorization and
concurrent review process, must minimize the likelihood of having to recoup
already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess of $50,000 per provider within a
contract year must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, unless a subcontract
specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall ensure that 90% of all clean claims
are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid within 90
days of receipt of the clean claim.

During the term of this contract, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring all health plans
to use a standardized electronic format for electronic claims processing between
the plan and its providers. AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the
Technical Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by FFS providers and their billing agents who submit claims
electronically to AHCCCS. The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts will be supplemented
by a Form C layout. All formats are subject to changes as required by federal
law. Reasonable implementation timeframes will be negotiated with each plan.


                                       46
<PAGE>

35.      HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals for member care in accordance with
AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is encouraged to obtain contracts with
hospitals in all GSA's and must submit copies of these contracts to AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care, at least seven days prior to the effective dates
thereof.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical reviews of all
hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously paid claims are subject to
recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack of medical necessity
through concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review, lack of medical
necessity identified during postpayment medical review shall not constitute a
basis for recoupment by the Contractor. See also Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims
Payment System. For a more complete description of the guidelines for hospital
reimbursement, please consult the Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and
rules.

FOR OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state
hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

36.      NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility
described above applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. To further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member
could be ALTCS eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that
occurs on the same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of services while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor. The Contractor is not responsible for the full 90 days of nursing
facility coverage if ALTCS enrollment occurs before the 90 days has ended.

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in a
nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If
the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program
Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility coverage,
the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage during the time
the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing facility services covered by
a third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day maximum.


                                       47
<PAGE>
37.   COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, delivery supplement, HIV-AIDS
supplement, reinsurance (PPC and prospective), and third party liability, as
described and defined within this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or
policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer nor indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, and as
otherwise specified in this section, any savings remaining to the Contractor as
a result of favorable claims experience and efficiencies in service delivery at
the end of the contract term may be kept by the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be separately
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund, as described in A.R.S. ss.36-2913. An error discovered by the State with
or without an audit in the amount of fees paid to Contractor will be subject to
adjustment or repayment by Contractor making a corresponding decrease in a
current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment by AHCCCSA to
the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the Contractor. This
section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from making payment to a
fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required copayment from
members but service will not be denied for inability to pay the copayment.
Except for permitted copayments, the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not
bill or attempt to collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all PPC member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during prior period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation
described below. Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of
members who were enrolled at the time of delivery.


                                       48
<PAGE>


RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For CYE `98 and CYE `99, AHCCCSA
will offer a reconciliation process for contractors whose total PPC medical cost
experience (excluding administrative and non-operating expenses) is more than
10% higher than the reimbursement associated with PPC in two areas: the "retro"
portion of the capitation rate for all rate categories, and the prospective
three-day notification period for MN/MI recipients only. Expenses will be net of
reinsurance for both the retro and prospective period.

AHCCCSA will reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable costs in excess
of a 10% limit as determined by reported encounters. AHCCCS will recoup profit
amounts in excess of a 10% limit.

For CYE `00 and `01, a full reconciliation to 0% profit or loss will be done by
AHCCCSA for the same eligibility time periods and risk groups noted above.
AHCCCSA will reimburse the health plans 100% of any excess reasonable costs as
determined by reported encounters, and all profits will be recouped. Refer to
the Office of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further details of
the reconciliation process.

DELIVERY SUPPLEMENT. When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: On a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA shall utilize encounters to
determine the number of members receiving approved HIV/AIDS drugs and calculate
the amount of the supplemental payment. The rate of reimbursement for this
separate per member per month payment is specified in Section B and is subject
to review during the term of the contract. AHCCCSA reserves the right to recoup
any amounts paid for ineligible members as determined through an encounter data
review as well as an associated penalty for incorrect encounter reporting.

Refer to the Office of Managed Care's HIV/AIDS supplemental payment and review
policies for further details and requirements.


38.   INCENTIVE FUND. AHCCCSA MAY RETAIN A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF CAPITATION
REIMBURSEMENT IN ORDER TO DISTRIBUTE TO CONTRACTORS BASED ON THEIR PERFORMANCE
MEASURE OUTCOMES. AHCCCSA WILL NOTIFY CONTRACTORS 60 DAYS PRIOR TO A NEW
CONTRACT YEAR IF THIS METHODOLOGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND WILL PROVIDE DETAILS
OF THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY AT THAT TIME. CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect of a
program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is needed. In these
instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions discussed with the
Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The Contractor may request a
review of a program change if it believes the program change was not equitable;
AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.


                                       49

<PAGE>

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a.       death of a member

b.       member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date
         of incarceration)

c.       duplicate capitation to the same contractor

d.       adjustment based on change in member's contract type

If a member is enrolled twice with the same contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39.   REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program
provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered
inpatient facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical
condition beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503 and R9-31-503). Per
diem rates paid for nursing facility services, including room and board,
provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall
be eligible for reinsurance coverage. Refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Prospective reinsurance coverage applies to prospective enrollment periods. The
deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS acute care
enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services) as of
October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown in the
following table. These deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during
the term of this contract. Any change would have a corresponding impact on
capitation rates.

</TABLE>

A Contractor whose enrollment qualifies for the $35,000 or $50,000 non-MN/MI
deductible level may, prior to the start of the contract period, elect one of
the lower deductible levels indicated in the above table. Contractors may not
elect to increase their deductible level. If a Contractor's actual non-MN/MI
deductible is $35,000 or $50,000, AHCCCSA will increase the Contractor's
capitation rate awarded by defined amounts for each capitation risk group. These
specific capitation adjustments are available from the Office of Managed Care.


                                       50
<PAGE>


PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: A separate reinsurance deductible and
coinsurance percentage will apply during prior period coverage. As noted in the
table above, all Contractors, regardless of enrollment, will be subject to a
$5,000 deductible level. The coinsurance percentage for the prior period
coverage reinsurance is 100%. Expenses incurred during prior period coverage
will not apply toward the prospective reinsurance thresholds.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance benefits. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide
for a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used
in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.

Effective October 1, 1998, when a member changes Contractors within a contract
year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs incurred for that
member will follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all
submitted encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of
service within the current contract year) will be applied toward the receiving
health plan's deductible level. For further details regarding this policy and
other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing
Manual.

Medical review on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance cases will
be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random sampling.
AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, will generate the sampling and will
notify the Contractor of documentation needed for the retrospective medical
review process to occur at the Contractor's offices. Reinsurance consideration
will be given to inpatient facility contracts, and hearing decisions rendered by
the Office of Legal Assistance. Prehearing and/or hearing penalties discoverable
during the review process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance. A recoupment
of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor will occur based on the
results of the medical review sampling. The results of the medical review
sampling will be separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance reimbursement populations in the review time frame
for the Contractor. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days advance
notice of any on-site review. The Contractor shall have all requested medical
records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall be made
available upon request of the Review Team during the course of the review. The
Contractor representative shall be available to the Review Team at all times
during AHCCCSA on-site review activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall
provide the Review Team with workspace, access to a telephone, electrical
outlets and privacy for conferences. The Contractor will be furnished a copy of
the Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the on-site review and given an
opportunity to comment on any review findings.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia, von Willebrand's Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. This program
also covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and tissue
transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver, kidney,
and other organ transplantation. For additional detail and restrictions refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All catastrophic claims are
subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.


                                       51


<PAGE>


The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, Reinsurance
Unit, of cases identified for catastrophic non-transplant reinsurance coverage
within 30 days of (a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and
(c) the beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid
for a maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to
AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When a member is identified as being catastrophically eligible by
AHCCCSA due to the specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1,
286.2), all medically necessary covered services provided during the contract
year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders and
dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify AHCCCS
Office of Medical Management Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis. All medically
necessary covered services provided during the contract year shall be eligible
for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy. All medically necessary covered services provided during
the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's
paid amount.

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts and cornea transplantation services are not eligible
for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the regular
(non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM, Chapter 300 for
covered services for organ and tissue transplants. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount,
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library. When a member is referred to a transplant facility for an
AHCCCS-covered organ transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of
Medical Management.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits
for transplants. However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the
responsibility for submitting encounters for all catastrophic reinsurance
services.

All reinsurance claims must be submitted in accordance with R9-22-703 and the
AHCCCS Re-insurance Claims Processing Manual.

40.   COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and postpayment recovery. See Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare
Services and Cost Sharing.

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires


                                       52
<PAGE>


the member to pay any copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is
responsible for making these payments, even if the services are provided outside
of the Contractor's network. The Contractor's liability for coinsurance and
deductibles is limited to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire
service pursuant to a written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS
fee-for-service rate, less any amount paid by the third party. (The Contractor
must decide whether it is more cost-effective to provide the service within its
network or pay coinsurance and deductibles for a service outside its network.
For continuity of care, the Contractor may also choose to provide the service
within its network.) If the Contractor refers the member for services to a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare), and the insurer requires payment in
advance of all copayments, coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make
such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so. (See also Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
pre-natal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits. Further, if a
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost
avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that
the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use
of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES. Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The Contractor shall identify
all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except
in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the
following circumstances unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by
AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance            Adoption recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance            Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors                                          Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-l002 and R9-31-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In
joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to the
referral of any and all relevant case information to AHCCCSA's authorized
representative by the Contractor. AHCCCSA's authorized representative is also
responsible for negotiating and acting


                                       53
<PAGE>


in the best interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable settlement in joint
cases and may compromise a settlement in order to maximize overall
reimbursement, net of legal and other costs. For total plan cases involving only
payments from the Contractor, the Contractor is responsible for performing all
research, investigation, the filing of liens and payment of lien filing fees and
other related costs. The Contractor shall use the cover sheet as prescribed by
AHCCCS when filing Liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a.       Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
         Contractor's financial liability for the member

b.       There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
         reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.)

c.       Such recovery is not prohibited by state or federal law

REPORTING. The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. In addition, upon AHCCCS's request, the Contractor shall
provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed
cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member's first and
last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount; paid/recovered amount;
and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide the format and reporting
schedule for this information to the Contractor. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working days of the
identification of a third-party liability case with reinsurance. Failure to
report reinsurance cases may result in one of the remedies specified in
Paragraph 60 (Sanctions) of Section D. The Contractor shall communicate any
known change in health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the
date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the
Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a complete
file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for the
purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA
of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by
AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE): Eligibility for KidsCare benefits requires that the
applicant/member not be enrolled with or entitled to any other health insurance
benefits. If the Contractor becomes aware of any such potential coverage, the
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. The Contractor shall follow the
same cost avoidance and postpayment recovery practices for the KidsCare
population as it does for the Title XIX population, and shall maintain a
reporting system which allows Title XIX and KidsCare information to be reported
separately.

CONTRACT TERMINATION. Upon termination of this contract, the Contractor will
complete the existing third party liability cases or make any necessary
arrangements to transfer the cases to AHCCCSA's authorized TPL representative.



                                       54
<PAGE>

41.   MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligible". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. The Contractor is responsible for adhering to the cost sharing
responsibilities presented in the AHCCCS Medicare Cost Sharing policy. Effective
10/1/97, the Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare
payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same service of a
non-Medicare member.

42.   COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-711 and R9-31-711. The Contractor may not
collect copayments for family planning and EPSDT services.

43.   RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all reasonable times
during the term of this contract and the period set forth in paragraphs a. and
b. below any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by any
authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or federal government.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract except as provided
in paragraphs a. and b. below:

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to
the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for a period of five
years from the date of any such termination. Records which relate to grievances,
disputes, litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the performance
of this contract, or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has
been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of five
years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44.   MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 working days
of receipt of request. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical
record is established when information is received about a member. If the PCP
has not yet seen the member, such information may be kept temporarily in an
appropriately labeled file,


                                       55
<PAGE>


in lieu of actually establishing a medical record, but must be associated with
the member's medical record as soon as one is established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 working days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member if the reason for such request is directly related to the
administration of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed. (A.R.S.ss.36-664I)

45.   ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the Office of Managed Care.

46.   ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSAs as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.



                                       56
<PAGE>

47.   DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines which is available in the Bidder's Library. The information
so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all procedures,
policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this contract. If any
of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter
changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted
input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for
any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous
input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
describes the specific technical and procedural requirements for interfaces
between AHCCCS and the Contractor and its subcontractors. The Contractor is
responsible for complying with all technical requirements as stated in this
manual as well as any subsequent changes to the manual. A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.


                                       57
<PAGE>


ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI): In addition to the requirements outlined in
Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System, the Contractor will be required
to comply with all administrative simplification provisions resulting from the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The administrative
simplification section standardizes electronic transaction formats and code
sets; establishes national identifiers for providers, employers, health plans,
and individuals; and sets standards for security and privacy. Each of these
provisions will be published as one or more Final Rules in the Federal Register.
Implementation of these provisions will be required two years after the
effective date of each provision's final rule as published by the Department of
Health and Human Services.

in the event that systems fail.

48.   ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance measures. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered services for
which the Contractor incurred a financial liability, including services provided
during prior period coverage. This requirement is a condition of the HCFA grant
award.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats. Formatting and specific
requirements for encounter data are described in the AHCCCS Encounter Reporting
User Manual and the AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines, copies of which may
be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission Requirements are
included herein as Attachment I.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available to
AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim to an
adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found in The Encounter
User's Manual.

49.   MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and changes to
members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the Contractor
shall use to update its member records. The daily roster which is run prior to
the monthly roster is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate
code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end of every month.
The roster will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of
the first day of the next month. This roster contains the information used by
AHCCCSA to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month. The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly roster.
After reconciling the monthly roster information, the Contractor resumes posting
daily roster updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month.



                                       58

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
available in the Bidder's Library for additional information.

50.   TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through 9/30/98. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the sole option to extend the term of the contract, not to
exceed a total contracting period of five years. The terms and conditions of any
such contract extension shall remain the same as the original contract, as
amended. Any contract extension, however, shall not affect the maximum
contracting period of five years. All contract extensions shall be through
contract amendment. If, in conjunction with a contract extension, AHCCCSA elects
to increase the capitation rate for any risk category, such increase will not
exceed in aggregate the inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another. Further,
AHCCCSA may require a contractor to renew all GSAs, or may terminate remaining
GSAs if the Contractor does not agree to renew all GSAs.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the provisions of such
extension will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the extension amendment has not been signed by the
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing
that it refuses to sign the extension amendment. If the Contractor provides such
notification, AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 180 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

51.   SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See policy on claims processing by
subcontracted providers in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing, and shall incorporate by
reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The following subcontracts
shall be submitted to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30
days prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.       Automated data processing

b.       Third-party administrators

c.       Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)

d.       Model subcontracts

e.       Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
         subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts,
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is voidable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA. All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of federal and State laws,
regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider the
Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing services on its behalf more
than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions to this requirement include
the following:

a.       If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the
         contract year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the
         Contractor, the Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal
         to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt
         to gain such agreement.

b.       If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
         physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS
Office of Managed Care.


                                       60


<PAGE>

Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the provisions of Attachment A,
Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each subcontract must contain the
following:

a.       Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
         consideration to be received by the subcontractor.

b.       Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.

c.       Identification of the population, to include patient capacity, to be
         covered by the subcontractor.

d.       The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be provided, and
         for which compensation will be paid.

e.       The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending dates,
         methods of extension, termination and re-negotiation.

f.       The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of
         benefits and determination of third-party liability.

g.       A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and
         other third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or third
         party liability payment before submitting claims to the Contractor.

h.       A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
         keeping system.

i.       Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
         assurance programs and comply with the utilization control and review
         procedures specified in 42 CFR Part 456, as implemented by AHCCCSA.

j.       A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in
         ownership of a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the
         Contractor shall require a contract amendment and prior approval of
         AHCCCSA.

k.       Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population
         (may also refer to the Provider Manual).

l.       A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all
         tax obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other
         applicable insurance coverage obligations which arise under this
         subcontract, for itself and its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have
         no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
         coverage.

m.       A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary
         authorization from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to
         eligible and/or enrolled members.

n.       A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting
         and claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

52.   SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over and supersede existing and future subcontracts for services
that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving this
requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement for
transplant surgery exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty
contract.


                                       61
<PAGE>


During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts.

AHCCCSA shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor
prior to the implementation of any specialty contract.

53.   MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA Contracting Office as described in
Section D, Paragraph 51, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must be submitted
with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or corporate
allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are determined to
be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment to the
Contractor, the Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or
financial sanctions may be imposed.

54.   MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a consultant or actuary
are less than $50,000, AHCCCSA will waive the requirement for an audit of that
consultant or actuary.

55.   MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 15 days after contract
award.

Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:


<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Geographic Service Area                   Capitalization Requirement

    GSA #16    Apache, Navajo                       650,000
    GSA #18    Cochise, Santa Cruz                1,450,000
</TABLE>


                                       62
<PAGE>


NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSAs, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSAs awarded. This requirement is in addition to the
Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57 below and must be
met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirements may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA that
they are currently servicing must meet the equity per member standard (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) for their current
membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must fund
through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet this requirement.
Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional
capitalization for the new GSA they are bidding. (See the table of requirements
by GSA above). Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their
existing membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $5,000,000 in equity.

56.   PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to
providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance by
the Contractor of its obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond
shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS Performance
Bond policy available in the Office of Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.    Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers and
      nonproviders by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
      this contract,

b.    Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
      Contractor, and

c.    Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses incurred
      by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under this contract,
      including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after termination of this
      contract for reasons other than the convenience cf the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and


                                       63
<PAGE>


necessary UCC filings pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the
event such substitute security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the
Contractor acknowledges that it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such
substitute security to secure performance of its obligations under this
contract. The Contractor is solely responsible for establishing the
credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute security. AHCCCSA may, after
written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its permission for substitute
security, in which case the Contractor shall provide AHCCCSA with a form of
security described above. The Contractor may not change the amount, duration or
scope of the performance bond without prior written approval from AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or create other
creditors using the bond as security.

57.   AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid in the month of October 1997, or as
determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include SOBRA
supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied by the Contractor not
later than 15 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the amount required.
Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics of the Contractor
on a monthly basis. If there is an increase in capitation payment that exceeds
10% of the performance bond amount, AHCCCSA may require an increase in the
amount of the Performance Bond. The Contractor shall have 15 days following
notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Performance Bond amount that must be maintained after the contract term shall be
sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by
AHCCCSA. The Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond
without prior written approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

58.   FINANCIAL VIABILITY CRITERIA/PERFORMANCE MEASURES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability criteria/performance
goals:

    CURRENT RATIO                        Current assets divided by current
                                         liabilities. "Current assets" includes
                                         any long-term investments that can be
                                         converted to cash within 24 hours
                                         without significant penalty (i.e.,
                                         greater than 20%).
                                         Standard: At least 1.00

    EQUITY PER MEMBER                    Equity, less on-balance sheet
                                         performance bond, divided by the number
                                         of non-SOBRA Family Planning Extension
                                         Services members enrolled at the end of
                                         the period.
                                         Standard: At least $150
                                         (Failure to meet this standard may
                                         result in an enrollment cap being
                                         imposed in any or all contracted
                                         GSAS.I)


                                       64
<PAGE>


    MEDICAL EXPENSE RATIO                Total medical expenses (net of
                                         reinsurance, TPL, HIV/AIDS Supplement)
                                         divided by total capitation + Delivery
                                         Supplement.
                                         Standard: At least 85%

    ADMINISTRATIVE COST PERCENTAGE       Total administrative expenses

                                         + TPL + reinsurance + HIV/AIDS
                                         Supplement.

                                         the period, net of sub-capitation
                                         expense
                                         Standard: No more than 30 days


59.   MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract
amendment. The Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or
transition plan to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review. The purpose of
the plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new
entity's ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to
members are not diminished and that major components of the organization and
AHCCCS programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or
change in ownership.

60.   SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may impose sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or terminate this
contract or any related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-405
and 406 and R9-31-405 and 406 and the terms of this contract and applicable
federal or State law and regulations. Written notice will be provided to the
Contractor specifying the sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction
and either the length of suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be
withheld. The Contractor may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-804.

In addition to the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose partial or
full enrollment caps on the Contractor. Among the contract violations that may
result in an enrollment cap are, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Marketing violations

b.       Failure to meet AHCCCS financial viability standards

c.       Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network

d.       Quality of care and quality management issues

e.       Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards


                                       65
<PAGE>


CURE NOTICE PROCESS - Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of sanctions.

61.   AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to contractors
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm favors those
contractors with lower capitation rates. For further details on the AHCCCS
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change the
algorithm at any time during the term of the contract and frequently does so in
response to contractor-specific issues of non-compliance (e.g. imposition of an
enrollment cap). The Contractor should consider this in preparing its response
to this RFP. AHCCCSA is not obligated to adjust for any financial impacts this
may have on the Contractor.

62.   GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers, which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. This written policy shall be in accordance with applicable federal
and State law and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not limited to, AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22, Article 8 and R9-31, Article 8, the
Alternate Resolution Process and the Members Rights and Responsibilities. The
grievance process may not be delegated or subcontracted outside of the health
plan. Refer to Attachment H for a complete description of grievance process
requirements.

63.   QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly Grievance Report Format on file in the
Bidders Library. The Quarterly Grievance Report must be received by the AHCCCSA,
Office of Legal Assistance, no later than 45 days from the end of the quarter.

64.   KIDSCARE

On November 1, 1998, AHCCCSA implemented a Title XXI Children's Health Insurance
Program, referred to as "KidsCare". KidsCare provides health care coverage
statewide to eligible children under age 19 and is provided through the existing
AHCCCS health plans, state employee HMOs that elect to participate at the
beginning of a contract cycle, and tribal facilities or Indian Health Service
for Native Americans who elect to receive services through them. Services will
also be directly provided by participating community health clinics and
hospitals, which predominantly serve low income children.


                                       66
<PAGE>

The KidsCare service package is established by the legislature and approved by
HCFA through the State Plan. Services, limitations and exclusions are described
in Section D, Paragraph 1, Scope of Services. Capitation rates payable to the
Contractor for KidsCare members will be set by AHCCCSA in conjunction with an
independent actuary.

Effective October 1, 1999, KidsCare members in families with gross household
income over 150% and up to 200% of the federal poverty limit shall pay a premium
to AHCCCSA. The premium amount shall be based on the number of members in the
household and the gross family income in accordance with 9 A.A.C., Article 14.

TITLE XVI PARENT/GUARDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. A.R.S. ss.36.2984 mandates
that the Contractor offer health insurance coverage to the parent(s) or legal
guardian(s) of a child who is eligible for Title XXI. The Contractor shall
establish rates for this coverage, which must be approved by AHCCCSA, Office of
Managed Care, prior to implementation. Title XXI funds or any other federal or
state funds shall not be used to subsidize family coverage. The full cost of the
premium shall be paid by the parent or legal guardian who elects this coverage.
The Contractor may include provisions for pre-existing conditions and any other
medical underwriting considerations that are necessary to protect it from
adverse risk. For further information, refer to the Title XXI Parent Guardian
Health Insurance Coverage Guidelines on file in the Bidder's Library.

65.   PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

In addition to the requirements described in this RFP, there are several
legislative issues that could have an impact on services provided by the
Contractor on or after October 1, 2000. The following is a brief description of
the issues that AHCCCS is aware of at the time of the issuance of this renewal
amendment:

ELIGIBILITY BASED ON 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL): Through a
successful initiative effort, eligibility for AHCCCS has been expanded to allow
persons with income up to 100% of the FPL to become eligible for the Medicaid
program. Legislative action will be required to implement this new eligibility
guideline and HCFA must approve the expansion. If HCFA approval is granted,
there will be a significant number of new persons who will be eligible for the
program and enrolled with the health plans at some future date.

66.   SEPARATE INCORPORATION

As specified in A.R.S. ss. 36-2906.01, within 60 days of contract award, a
non-governmental Contractor shall have established a separate corporation for
the purposes of this contract, whose sole activity is the performance of
contract function with AHCCCS.

67.   CULTURAL COMPETENCY

The Contractor shall have a Cultural Competency Plan that meets the requirements
of the AHCCCS Cultural Competency Policy. The Contractor must identify a staff
member responsible for the cultural competency plan and inform the office of
Managed Care of that person's identity.


                                       67
<PAGE>

68.   MEDICAID IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Arizona Department of
Education, AHCCCS will begin paying participating school districts for
specifically identified Medicaid services provided to Medicaid eligible children
with special educational needs. The Medicaid service shall be identified in a
child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) as a medically necessary service. In
the first phase, AHCCCS shall directly reimburse school districts for speech,
physical and occupational therapies with dates of service beginning July 1,
2000. The Administration's intent is to add other Medicaid reimbursable services
in the future.

To ensure that there is coordination of care, the Administration shall require
that a participating school district notify the primary care provider that
Medicaid services are being provided to the child in a school-based setting. If
a child is enrolled with the Contractor and a request is made for a school-based
Medicaid covered service, the Contractor shall evaluate the request on the same
basis as any request for a covered service. The determination to provide the
service shall include consideration of whether the school-based services are
sufficient to meet the child's needs.

                               [END OF SECTION D]

perform. The demand shall be sent to the Contractor by certified mail, return

performance under any and all other contracts. In such situations, AHCCCSA
reserves the right to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches
of contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received. The
Contracting Officer shall mail written notice of the termination and the

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical laboratories to

responsible for all tax obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all
other applicable insurance coverage, for itself and its employees, and AHCCCSA
shall have no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
coverage.

26)   FRAUD AND ABUSE

fraud or abuse has occurred, the Contractor shall report the incident to the
prime contractor, who shall proceed in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plans
and Program Contractors Policy for Prevention, Detection and Reporting of Fraud

                     ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS

                          (By Geographic Service Area)


INSTRUCTIONS:

NOTE: OFFERORS ARE PERMITTED TO BID ONLY BY GEOGRAPHIC SERVICE AREA. PLEASE SEE
SECTION H, PARAGRAPH 9, AWARD OF CONTRACTS, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON BIDDING
BY GEOGRAPHIC SERVICE AREA.

Offerors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of meeting
contract requirements. The information that follows describes the minimum
network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA). The minimum bid is a
single entire GSA, as depicted on the following page.

In some GSA's there are required service sites located outside of the
geographical boundary of a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical access
to care. In certain instances, a member must travel a much greater distance to
receive services within their assigned GSA if the member were not allowed to
receive services in an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which straddle
two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these zip codes is
based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip code has been assigned by
AHCCCS. The Offeror shall be responsible for providing services to members
residing in the entire zip code that is assigned to the GSA for which the
Offeror has agreed to provide services. The split zip codes GSA assignments are
as follows:

</TABLE>


If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, and pediatrics) are not
included in the primary care provider contract, at least one subcontract is
required for each of these specialties in the service sites specified. General
surgeons must be available within 50 miles of service sites.

<PAGE>


In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Offeror must
demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that
members don't need to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific to
GSA # 6.

Offerors bidding in GSA's other than GSA 10 and GSA 12 are encouraged to
contract with the hospitals in their provider network. However, AHCCCSA will not
award additional points in the evaluation process for hospital contracts in
rural areas. At a minimum, the Offeror shall have a physician with admitting and
treatment privileges with each hospital in its network. Offerors bidding in GSA
10 and/or GSA 12 must have at least one hospital contract in each service
district as depicted on the respective maps for GSA 10 and GSA 12. This
requirement is part of the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program, described more
fully in Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement. For offerors'
convenience, a list of Phoenix and Tucson area hospitals are included on the
reverse of the Phoenix and Tucson maps which follow.

Provider categories required at various service delivery sites included in the
Service Area Minimum Network Standards are indicated as follows:

         H        Hospitals
         P        Primary Care Providers (physicians, certified nurse
                  practitioners and physician assistants)

           ATTACHMENT H: GRIEVANCE AND REQUEST FOR HEARING PROCESS AND
                                    STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance and request for hearing
policy for members and providers which defines their rights regarding any
adverse action by the Contractor. The Contractor shall also ensure compliance
with 9 A.C.C. R9-28-Article 12 the Members' Rights and Responsibilities Policy.
The written grievance and request for hearing policy shall be in accordance with
applicable federal and State laws and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not
limited to, AHCCCS Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518 (A); R9-22-802 and R9-22-804. The
grievance and request for hearing policy shall include the following provisions:

a.       The grievance and request for hearing procedure will be provided all
         subcontractors at time of contract, and to non-contracting providers
         within 10 days of the date of receipt of the claim. For non-contracting
         providers, the grievance and request for hearing procedure may be
         mailed with the remittance advice provided the remittance is sent
         within 45 days of receipt of claim.

b.       Specific individual(s) are appointed with authority to require
         corrective action to administer the grievance and request for hearing
         policy.

c.       A log is maintained for all grievance and request for hearings
         containing sufficient information to identify the grievant, date of
         receipt, nature of the grievance and request for hearing and the date
         grievance and request for hearing is resolved. Separate logs must be
         maintained for provider and member grievance and request for hearings.
         The logs must contain sufficient information to identify the grievant,
         date of receipt, nature of the grievance and request for hearing and
         the date grievance and request for hearing is resolved.

d.       Within five working days of receipt, the grievant is informed by letter
         that the grievance and request for hearing has been received. The
         letter must also be in a second language when 200 members or 5% of the
         Contractor's population, whichever is greater speak the second
         language.

e.       Each grievance and request for hearing is thoroughly investigated using
         the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual provisions as well
         as the Contractor's policies and procedures, ensuring that facts are
         gathered from all parties.

f.       All documentation received and mailed by Contractor during the
         grievance and request for hearing process is dated upon date of
         receipt.

g.       All grievance and request for hearings are filed in a secure,
         designated area and are retained for five years following the final
         decision, judicial appeal or close of a grievance and request for
         hearing.

h.       A copy of the Contractor's final decision will be either hand-delivered
         or delivered by certified mail to all parties. The final decision shall
         be mailed to all other individuals by regular mail. The date of the
         final decision shall be the date of the notice. The final decision must
         include, and describe in detail, the following:

         1.       the nature of the grievance and request for hearing
         2.       the issues involved
         3.       the reasons supporting the Contractor's decision including
                  references to applicable statute, rule and procedure


                                      H-1
<PAGE>

         4.       the grievant's right to appeal the Contractor's decision to
                  AHCCCSA by filing the appeal to the Contractor no later than
                  15 days after the date of the Contractor's final decision.
                  This must also be written in a second language, if applicable.

i.       If the member requests a hearing, all supporting documentation must be
         received by the AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance no later than five
         working days from the date the Contractor receives the appeal or from
         the date of the oral or written request from AHCCCSA, Office of Legal
         Assistance. The appeal file must contain a cover letter that includes:

         1.       grievant's name
         2.       grievant's AHCCCS ID number
         3.       grievant's address
         4.       phone number (if applicable)
         5.       date of receipt of grievance and request for hearing and
                  appeal
         6.       summary of the Contractor's actions undertaken to resolve
                  the grievance and request for hearing and basis thereof

j.       The following material shall be included in the appeal file:
         1.       written request of the grievant asking for the appeal
         2.       copies of the entire file which include the investigations
                  and/or medical records; and the Contractor's grievance and
                  request for hearing decision
         3.       other information used by the Contractor to resolve the
                  grievance and request for hearing and that would be necessary
                  to AHCCCSA to resolve the grievance and request for hearing.

k.       The Contractor may attempt to use alternative resolution procedures to
         resolve disputes presented to the Contractor verbally or in writing. If
         the Contractor elects to use an alternative resolution process, it must
         be administered and completed within 10 days from receipt of the
         dispute. If the matter is not resolved to the grievant's satisfaction
         within the 10-day period, the dispute must then be adjudicated using
         the grievance and request for hearing standards contained above.
         However, the Contractor must render the written grievance and request
         for hearing decision within a maximum of 30 days from the date of the
         initial filing of the grievance and request for hearing or dispute
         unless a longer period was agreed to by the parties involved.

l.       For all disputes where an alternative resolution is proposed, the
         Contractor must maintain a separate log, complying with paragraphs c.
         and g. above.

                 ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any
findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the imposition
of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

PENDED ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days of the
original processing date. Sanctions will be imposed according to the following
schedule for each encounter pended for more than 120 days unless the pend is due
to AHCCCSA error:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
0-l20 days     121-l80 day's        181-240 days       241-360 days         361+ days
<S>            <C>                 <C>                <C>                 <C>
No sanction    $ 5 per month       $ 10 per month     $ 15 per month      $ 20 per month
</TABLE>

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter which (1) AHCCCSA acknowledges
to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the system
programming, an update to the database reference table, or further research by
AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that the resolution of a pended
encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will respond in
writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA response
will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the
total number of sanctionable encounters pended more than 120 days.

Pended encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 120 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon request,
make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

ENCOUNTER VALIDATION STUDIES

Per HCFA requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's


                                      I-1
<PAGE>

submitted encounter data. Any and all covered services may be validated as part
of these studies. Encounter validation studies will be conducted at least
yearly. The following reflects AHCCCSA'S encounter validation study process and
sanction policy as of 10/1/97. AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines,
and sanction amounts based on agency review or as a result of consultations with
HCFA. The Contractor will be notified in writing of any significant change in
study methodology.

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records requested
within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If
AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from the
Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date that the
encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be received by AHCCCSA no
later than 240 days after the end of the month in which the service was
rendered, or the effective date of enrollment with the Contractor, whichever is
later. For all encounters for which timeliness is evaluated, a sanction per
encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if
the encounter record is received by AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date
determined above. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per
error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has changed, or if
HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the
sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate description of
AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction per encounter error
extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter is
incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will
be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however,
sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality
has changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be
notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the
studies begin.

Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA'S pending encounter file or historical
files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A" and for Study "B", a
sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
assessed for an omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be
$5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and
$10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "B";
however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter
quality has changed, or if


                                      I-2
<PAGE>

HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the
sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence
interval shows the range within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If
error rates are based on a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes
will be the lower limit of the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples, which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to HCFA, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance and request for hearing pursuant to Article
8 of AHCCCS Rules. Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's
capitation payment.

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

Contractors are required to submit adjusted or voided encounters in the event
that claims are subsequently adjusted or denied after the initial encounter
submission. This includes adjustments for inaccuracies identified by fraud and
abuse audits or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA or the Contractor.
Contractors shall refer to the Encounter User's Manual for further instructions
regarding adjustments to encounters.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS                                   CONTRACT/RFP NO. YH8-0001

                         SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1. SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 2, the AHCCCS Medical Policy
Manual (AMPM), and the document entitled "AHCCCS Health Plan Performance
Indicators", all of which are incorporated herein by reference and may be found
in the Bidder's Library. The covered services are briefly described below.
Covered services must be medically necessary and provided by, or coordinated
with, a primary care provider, except for behavioral health and children's
preventive dental services. Services must be rendered by providers that are
appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their scope of practice,
and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall provide the same
standard of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.


KIDSCARE COVERED SERVICES: KidsCare members are eligible for the same services
covered for members under the Title XIX and state-only programs, with the
following differences, exclusions and/or limitations:

a.       Non-emergency transportation is not covered.
b.       Chiropractic services are not covered.
c.       Vision services are limited to one eye examination per contract year
         and one pair of glasses or contacts every contract year.
d.       EPSDT services are limited to those services specified in this
         contract.
e.       Behavioral health services are limited to 30 inpatient days and 30
         outpatient visits per contract year. (See details under Section D
         Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.)
f.       Licensed midwives and home deliveries are not covered.

For further details regarding the KidsCare program, see Section D, Paragraph 64,
KidsCare, and the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM).

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a free-standing surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through other than medical or surgical means
(i.e. hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.


                                       15
<PAGE>

CHILDREN'S REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-22, Article 2
A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3. Eligibility criteria and the referral
process are described in the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual available in the
Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall monitor referrals to CRS to ensure CRS covered services are
provided in a timely manner to eligible members. Referral to CRS does not
relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for providing medically necessary
services not covered by CRS to CRS eligible members. The Contractor is also
responsible for initial care of newborn members, who are CRS eligible. The
Contractor must require the member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) to coordinate
their care with the CRS program. All services provided must be included in the
member's medical record maintained by the PCP.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS. If the member
uses their private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, and the member
is not enrolled with CRS, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable
deductibles and copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered
services to its members. If the Contractor becomes aware that CRS has failed to
meet the established appointment standards, or has failed to provide medically
necessary CRS covered services, the Contractor shall immediately notify AHCCCSA,
Office of Medical Management, of the occurrence. In accordance with AHCCCS
policy, the Contractor may seek reimbursement from CRS for providing CRS covered
services.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
Title XIX members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved
by the Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition.
Medicare approved chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to
limitations specified in CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if
prescribed by the member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

DENTAL: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services; dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the AHCCCS periodicity
schedule; therapeutic dental services; dentures; and pre-transplantation dental
services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance with the EPSDT periodicity
schedule for dental screening services and ensure that dental service reports
are included in the member's medical record maintained by the PCP. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Measures. The Contractor shall
ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the member
has not been scheduled for a visit. If no dental screening is received by the
member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may request
dental services without referral and may choose a dental provider from the
Contractor's provider network. For members who are 21 years of age and older,
the Contractor shall provide emergency dental care, medically necessary dentures
and dental services for transplantation services as specified in the AMPM.
Dental standards may be found in the AMPM, Section 310, which is incorporated
herein by reference and which may be found in the Bidder's Library.

DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease
(ESRD) providers. Services may be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an
inpatient basis if the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic
dialysis services.


                                       16
<PAGE>

EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT (EPSDT): The Contractor
shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment to correct or
ameliorate defects and physical or mental illness discovered by the screenings
for members under age 21. The Contractor shall ensure that these members receive
required health screenings, including developmental/behavioral health, in
compliance with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule (Exhibit 430-1 in the AMPM) and
to submit to the AHCCCS Office of Medical Management, all EPSDT reports as
required by AHCCCS medical policy. The Contractor is required to meet specific
participation/utilization rates for members as described in Section D, Paragraph
16, Performance Measures. Because the behavioral health benefit for Title XIX
and Title XXI is provided through the ADHS/RBHA system, the Contractor shall
ensure the initiation and coordination of the referral of these members to the
RBHA and shall follow up with the RBHA to monitor whether members have received
behavioral health services. Title XXI members are not entitled to the
all-encompassing EPSDT service package required for Title XIX children. Title
XXI children are entitled only to the EPSDT and other covered services specified
in this document, the AMPM and the Title XXI State Plan.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

a.       Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
         professionals to provide pre-hospital, emergency care on a
         24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
         emergent condition as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-101 and R9-31-101.
         Emergency medical services are covered without prior authorization. The
         Contractor is encouraged to contract with emergency service facilities
         for the provision of emergency services. The Contractor is encouraged
         to contract with or employ the services of non-emergency facilities
         (e.g. urgent care centers) to address member non-emergency care issues
         occurring after regular office hours or on weekends. The Contractor
         shall be responsible for educating members and providers regarding
         appropriate utilization of emergency room services including behavioral
         health emergencies. The Contractor shall monitor emergency service
         utilization (by both provider and member) and shall have guidelines for
         implementing corrective action for inappropriate utilization. For
         utilization review, the test for appropriateness of the request for
         emergency services shall be whether a prudent layperson, similarly
         situated, would have requested such services. For purposes of this
         contract, a "prudent layperson" is a person who possesses an average
         knowledge of health and medicine.
b.       All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition
c.       Emergency transportation
d.       Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
         assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent
         situations, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
e.       The Contractor shall comply with guidelines regarding the coordination
         of post-stabilization care.

EYE EXAMINATIONS/OPTOMETRY: The Contractor shall provide all medically necessary
emergency eye care, vision examinations, prescriptive lenses, and treatments for
conditions of the eye for all members under the age of 21, with the exception of
KidsCare members. See limitations for KidsCare members described at the
beginning of this section, titled "KidsCare Covered Services." For members who
are 21 years of age and older, the Contractor shall provide emergency care for
eye conditions which meet the definition of an emergency medical condition,
cataract removal, and/or medically necessary vision examinations and
prescriptive lenses if required following cataract removal and other eye
conditions as specified in the AMPM.

FAMILY PLANNING: The Contractor shall provide family planning services in
accordance with the AMPM, Section 420 for all members who choose to delay or
prevent pregnancy. These include medical, surgical, pharmacological and
laboratory services, as well as contraceptive devices. Information and
counseling necessary to allow the members to make informed decisions regarding
family planning methods shall also be included. If the Contractor does not
provide family planning services, it must contract for these services through

XIX and state-only members anticipated to have a low-risk prenatal course and
delivery may elect to receive maternity services of prenatal care, labor and
delivery and postpartum care provided by licensed midwives if they are in the
Contractor's provider network. All licensed midwife labor and delivery services

centers. Members receiving maternity services from a licensed midwife must also
be assigned to a PCP for other health care and medical services. Home delivery
and licensed midwives are not covered for Title XXI members.

The Contractor shall allow women and their newborns to receive up to 48 hours of
inpatient hospital care after a routine vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours of
inpatient care after a cesarean delivery. The attending health care provider, in

price of the item. Reasonable repairs or adjustments of purchased equipment are
covered to make the equipment serviceable and/or when the repair cost is less
than renting or purchasing another unit.

NURSING FACILITY: The Contractor shall provide nursing facility services,
including religious nonmedical health care institutions, for members who require

services, basic patient care equipment and sickroom supplies, dietary services,
administrative physician visits, non-customized DME, necessary maintenance
rehabilitation therapies, over-the-counter medications, social, recreational and
spiritual activities, and administrative, operational medical direction
services. The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility
services for any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently
residing in a nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this
contract. If the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS
Program Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility
coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage
during the time the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing facility
services covered by a third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member
is enrolled with the Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day limitation. See
Paragraph 36, Nursing Facility Reimbursement, for further details.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the stay
goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

NUTRITION: Nutritional assessments may be conducted as a part of the EPSDT
screenings for members under age 21, and to assist members 21 years of age and
older whose health status may improve with nutritional intervention. Assessment

members under the age of 21 are covered on both an inpatient and outpatient
basis if not used as a maintenance regimen.

when prescribed by the member's PCP or attending physician and is necessary to
restore, maintain or improve respiratory functioning.

TRANSPLANTATION OF ORGANS AND TISSUE, AND RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS: These
services are covered within limitations defined in the AMPM for members
diagnosed with specified medical conditions. Such limitations include whether
the stage of the disease is such that the transplant can affect the outcome; the
member has no other conditions that substantially reduce the potential for

necessary and required regimens of treatment. Bone grafts are also covered under
this service. Services include pre-transplant inpatient or outpatient
evaluation; donor search; organ/tissue harvesting or procurement; preparation
and transplantation services; and convalescent care. In addition, if a member
receives a transplant covered by a source other than AHCCCS, medically necessary
non-experimental services are provided within limitations after the discharge
from the acute care hospitalization for the transplantation. AHCCCS has
contracted with transplantation providers for the Contractor's use or the
Contractor may select its own transplantation provider. However, the quality of
services must be equal to or exceed those of the AHCCCS provider and the rate

4.       VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of the Social
Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program which became
effective 10/1/94. Through this program, the federal and state governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. Therefore, the Contractor shall not utilize AHCCCS
funding to purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19. Any provider,
licensed by the State to administer immunizations, may register with ADHS as a
"VFC provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall comply with all

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9-22, Article 17.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

Title XIX members, except for those eligible under the MN/MI program have a
choice of available health plans. A listing of the available health plans and
their telephone numbers will be given to each applicant during the application
process for AHCCCS benefits. Also included are instructions to applicants to
call the health plans directly with specific questions concerning the health
plan. If there is only one health plan available for the applicant's
Geographical Service Area, no choice is offered. Members who do not choose prior
to AHCCCSA's being notified of their eligibility are automatically assigned to a
health plan based on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm.

Title XXI members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned. When a member is transferred from
Title XIX to Title XXI and has not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the
member will remain with the Title XIX health plan and a choice notice will be
sent to the member. The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from
the date the choice notice is sent.

AHCCCSA assigns MN/MI members to an available health plan based on family
continuity or through AHCCCSA's auto-assignment algorithm. These members do not
get a choice of available contractors until their annual enrollment choice
period. Beginning 10/1/01, all Title XIX Waiver members, including MED's will
have a choice of available health plans.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX and state-only members
include: previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90
days will be automatically enrolled with the same contractor, if that contractor
is still available. Also, women who are eligible for the Family Planning
Services Extension Program will automatically remain assigned to the same health
plan. The Family Planning Services Extension Program provides a maximum of 24
months of family planning services.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX or state-only member with
the Contractor will generally be the day prior to the date the Contractor
receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily roster. However, the Contractor
is responsible for payment of medically necessary covered services retroactive
to the member's beginning date of eligibility, excluding any prior quarter
coverage period.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member will be the first day of
the month following notification to the health plan. If a Title XXI member is
determined eligible by the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled with
the health plan as of the 1st of the following month. If the member is
determined eligible AFTER the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled
with the health plan as of the 1st of the second following month.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for Title XIX and
state-only members. For Title XIX members except for MNMI's enrolled between
4/1/01 and 10/1/01, prior period coverage starts from the first day of the month
of application, or first eligible month, whichever is later. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary covered services
provided to members during prior period coverage. During the period 4/1/01
through 10/1/01, MNMI's will continue to have a two day retro period for prior
period coverage; however they will be entitled to all medically necessary
services due to their Title XIX eligibility. For state-only EAC members, prior
period coverage does not apply. For state-only ELIC members, prior period
coverage is generally limited to the two days prior to the date of AHCCCSA being
notified of eligibility. However, prior period coverage could include additional
days prior to the date of enrollment. The Contractor is responsible for payment
of all claims for medically necessary covered services provided on an emergency
basis to state-only members pursuant to A.R.S. ss.36-2908 and A.R.S. ss.36-2909
for the first two days of the prior period coverage. Any additional prior period
coverage for state-only members will include all claims for medically necessary
covered services. This may include services provided prior to the contract year
(See Section D, Paragraph 37, Compensation, for a description of the
Contractor's reimbursement from AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers, including Title XXI mothers,
who were enrolled at the time of the child's birth and whose newborn
notification was received by AHCCCSA will be enrolled with the mother's health
plan. The Contractor is responsible for notifying AHCCCSA of a child's birth to
an enrolled member. Capitation to the Contractor will begin on the date
notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of births during prior
period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the newborn's
date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered services to the
newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification of the child's birth.
Note that AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification calls 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. Title XIX and Title XXI eligible mothers of newborns are
sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for
their child; otherwise the child will remain with the mother's contractor.
Beginning 4/1/01, newborns of MNMI eligible women will become eligible and
enrolled under Title XIX rules.


                                       26
<PAGE>
Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a health plan and mothers of these
newborns are sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different
health plan for their child. In the event the FES mother chooses a different
health plan, AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned
plan and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of birth in the
second plan. The second plan will receive prior period capitation from the date
of birth to the day before assignment and prospective capitation from the date
of assignment forward. The second contractor will be responsible for all covered
services to the newborn from date of birth.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, or as an Eligible Assistance Child (EAC), the member is guaranteed a
minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Upon initial capitated
enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of
12 full months of continuous enrollment. Enrollment guarantees do not apply to
Native Americans who choose to obtain their covered services through Indian
Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service basis or children enrolled with
Department of Economic Security/Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program. The
enrollment guarantee applies a maximum of one time per member per eligibility
category for Title XIX, Title XXI, and EAC members. If a member changes from one
contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of
the guarantee period applies to the new contractor. The enrollment guarantee may
not be granted or may be terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor
child is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22, Article 17 and R9-31, Article 3 describes
other reasons for which the enrollment guarantee may not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans, on or off-reservation, have a choice to
receive services from Indian Health Service (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility
or any available contractor. If choice is not available or made within the
specified time limit, Native American Title XIX and state-only members living
on-reservation will be assigned to IHS and Native American Title XIX and
state-only members living off-reservation will be assigned to an available
contractor using AHCCCSA's family continuity policy and auto-assignment
algorithm. Native Americans may change from IHS to a contractor or from a
contractor to IHS at any time. Native American Title XXI members must make a
choice prior to being determined eligible.

7. MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, or physical or mental handicap, except where
medically indicated. Contractors must take into account a member's culture, when
addressing members and their concerns, and must take reasonable steps to
encourage subcontractors to do the same. The Contractor must make interpreters
available for members to ensure appropriate delivery of covered services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
         available facility.
b.       Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
         provided in a different manner or at a different time from that
         provided to other members, other public or private patients or the
         public at large except where medically necessary.
c.       Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
         related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in
         any way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed
         by others receiving any covered service.


                                       27
<PAGE>

d.       The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the
         basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
         ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
         membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
         served.

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e. the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

8. MEMBER INFORMATION

All informational materials prepared by the Contractor shall be approved by
AHCCCSA prior to distribution to members. The reading level and name of the
evaluation methodology used should be included when 200 members or 5% of the
Contractor's enrolled population, whichever is greater, speak a 2nd language,
the Contractor shall provide member information in that 2nd language. The
Contractor shall comply whenever it is aware that a population meets this
standard. When there are program or service site changes notification will be
provided to the affected members at least 14 days before implementation. The
Contractor shall review and update the Member Handbook at least once a year. The
Handbook must be submitted to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care for approval by
Sept. 1 of each contract year, or within four weeks of receiving the annual
renewal amendment, whichever is later.

The Contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all information prepared
for distribution to members is written at a 4th grade level.

The Contractor shall produce and provide the following printed information to
each member or family within 10 days of receipt of notification of the
enrollment date:

I.       A Member Handbook which, at a minimum, shall include the following
         items that are also listed in the Office of Managed Care, Operations

                  covered services (other than applicable copayments), what to
                  do if they are billed, and under what circumstances a member
                  may be billed for non-covered services.
         i.       Dual eligibility (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid); services
                  received in and out of the Contractor's network; copayments.

<PAGE>

member handbook shall also contain the following language regarding questions,
problems, grievances and requests for hearings (Ref. AHCCCS Rule R9-22-518 and
R9-31-518):

Q.       What if I have any questions, problems or complaints about
         [Contractor's name]?
A.       If you have a question or problem, please call ________ and ask to talk
         to a Member Representative. They are there to help you.
A.       If you have a specific complaint about your medical care, the Member
         Representative will help you.
Q.       What if I'm not happy with the help given to me by the Member
         Representative?
A.       If you are unhappy with the answer you receive, you can tell the Member
         Representative you want to file a written or oral grievance. The
         grievance must be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the
         action, decision, or incident.
A.       [Contractor's name] will make a final decision for grievances within 30
         days of receiving your written or oral grievance. A letter will be
         mailed to you stating the health plan's decision and the reason for the
         decision. The letter will tell you how you can appeal the decision if
         you are still unhappy. You must let the health plan know you want to
         appeal the decision letter.
A.       If you are appealing the health plan's decision, [Contractor's name]
         will send your request for appeal to the AHCCCSA. You will receive
         information from AHCCCSA on how your appeal will be handled. AHCCCSA
         will then decide if the health plan's decision was correct under the
         circumstances.

I.       A list of the names, telephone numbers and service site addresses of
         PCPs available for selection by the member and a description of the
         selection process. Upon request by the member, the Contractor must make
         information available regarding provider qualifications.

9. MEMBER SURVEYS

AHCCCSA may periodically conduct a survey of a representative sample of the
Contractor's membership. AHCCCSA will design a questionnaire to assess
accessibility, availability and continuity of care with PCPs; communication
between members and the Contractor; and general member satisfaction with the
AHCCCS program. To ensure comparability of results, the questions to the members
will be the same for all contractors. AHCCCSA will consider suggestions from the
Contractor for questions to be included in each survey. The results of these
surveys will become public information and available to all interested parties
upon request. In addition, unless waived by AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall
perform its own annual general or focused member survey. All such contractor
surveys must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.

10. MARKETING PLANS

The Contractor shall submit all proposed marketing plans and materials to
AHCCCSA for prior approval in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plan Marketing
Policy, a copy of which is available in the Bidder's Library. The Contractor
must have signed contracts with hospitals (in Maricopa and Pima counties), PCPs,
specialists and pharmacies in order for them to be included in marketing
materials.

11. ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE

AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual
anniversary date. AHCCCSA may hold an open enrollment on a limited basis as
deemed necessary. During AEC, members may change contractors subject to the
availability of other contractors within their Geographic Service Area.


                                       30
<PAGE>

Members are mailed a printed enrollment form and may choose a new contractor by
contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process. If the member does not
participate in the AEC, no change of contractor will be made (except for
approved changes under the Change of Plan Policy) during the new anniversary
year. This holds true if the Contractor's contract is renewed and the member
continues to live in the Contractor's service area. The Contractor shall comply
with the Office of Managed Care Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice
and Other Plan Changes policy.

12. TRANSITION OF MEMBERS

The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM, and the Office of Managed Care Member
Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice and Other Plan Changes standards for
member transitions between health plans or GSAs, to or from an ALTCS program
contractor, IHS, a PL 93-638 tribal entity, or a Title XXI direct service
provider and upon termination or expiration of a contract. The Contractor shall
develop and implement policies and procedures, which comply with AHCCCS medical
policy to address transition of:

1.       Members with significant medical conditions such as a high-risk
         pregnancy or pregnancy within the last 30 days, the need for organ or
         tissue transplantation, chronic illness resulting in hospitalization or
         nursing facility placement, etc.;
2.       Members who are receiving ongoing services such as dialysis, home
         health, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who are hospitalized
         at the time of transition;
3.       Members who have received prior authorization for services such as
         scheduled surgeries, out-of-area specialty services, nursing home
         admission;
4.       Prescriptions, DME and medically necessary transportation ordered for
         the transitioning member by the relinquishing contractor; and
5.       Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost of reproducing
         and forwarding medical records shall be the responsibility of the
         relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification of the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible to coordinate care with
the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and for
providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions of how to obtain services.

In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is terminated for any reason,
or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the transition of its members
to other contractors, and shall abide by standards and protocols set forth

                  decision to execute or not execute an advance directive, and
                  not making it a condition for the provision of care.

16. PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

All performance measures described below apply to Title XIX, Title XXI, and
state-only member populations.

Effective October 1, 2000, AHCCCS will require Contractors to adopt the Quality
Improvement System for Managed Care (QISMC). AHCCCS will work with the
Contractors to develop quality improvement projects that will meet the QISMC
guidelines. Compliance with this requirement will become a part of the
Operational and Financial Review after October 1, 2001.

Contractors shall strive to meet the AHCCCS stated performance measure goals.
However, it is equally important that Contractors continually improve their
performance measure outcomes from year to year. Improvement in performance is to
be measured by a reduction in the health plan's adverse outcomes. AHCCCS
requires the Contractor to achieve a reduction of ten percent or more from the
previous year's adverse outcomes. The Contractor's performance will also be
evaluated against the adjusted AHCCCS statewide average performance level,
excluding the effect of the Contractor's data.

A.       AHCCCS will require the Contractor to have a quality improvement plan
         in place when:

(1)      the Contractor has not achieved the AHCCCS statewide performance level
         for any measure but has shown significant improvement, or
(2)      the Contractor's rate has declined but is at or above the AHCCCS
         statewide performance level for any measure.

B.       The Contractor will be required to submit a corrective action plan and
         may be subject to sanctions if:

(1)      the Contractor has not achieved the AHCCCS statewide performance level
         for any measure and has failed to show adequate improvement, or
(2)      if the Contractor's rate has declined and fallen below the AHCCCS
         statewide performance level for any measure.

Corrective action plans must be received by the Office of Medical Management
within 30 days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS. AHCCCS may conduct one or
more follow-up on-site reviews to verify compliance with a corrective action
plan.

EPSDT PARTICIPATION: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program to at least 80% of all enrolled
members under age 21 during CYE 2001. The participant rate is the number of
children receiving at least one medical screen compared to the number of
children expected to receive at least one medical screen. The number of children
expected to receive at least one medical screen is based on the federal
periodicity schedule and the average period of eligibility.


                                       34
<PAGE>

AHCCCSA will measure participation levels through encounter data and will not
use information from prior period coverage (see Paragraph D.6, Prior Period
Coverage) in evaluating the Contractor's performance.

EPSDT IMMUNIZATIONS: The Contractor shall ensure members under age 21 receive
age-appropriate immunizations as specified in the AMPM. During CYE 2001, the
Contractor shall meet or exceed the following:

</TABLE>

The Contractor shall participate in an annual immunization audit based on random
sampling to assess and verify the immunization status of two-year-old members.
AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, within two weeks after the end of the
contract year, the selected sample, specifications for conducting the audit, the
AHCCCSA reporting requirements, and technical assistance. The Contractor shall
identify each child's PCP, conduct the assessment, and report to AHCCCSA in the
required format all immunization data for the sampled two-year-old children no
later than December 15 after the end of the contract year. If medical records
are missing for more than 5% of the sample group, the Contractor is subject to

study to validate the Contractor's reported rates.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: For CYE 2001, the Contractor shall comply with AHCCCS
quality management requirements to improve performance for all AHCCCS
established performance indicators. Complete descriptions of these indicators
can be found in the document Health Plan Performance Indicators, User and
Technical Specifications. AHCCCS has established goals for the following

22. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall include in its provider network a sufficient number of PCPs
to meet the requirements of this contract. Health care providers designated by
the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as allopathic or osteopathic
physicians who generally specialize in family practice, internal medicine,
obstetrics, gynecology, or pediatrics; certified nurse practitioners or
certified nurse midwifes; or physician's assistants.

At a minimum, the Contractor's number of full-time equivalent PCPs to enrolled
members shall not exceed a ratio of 1:1800 for adults and 1:1200 for children
who are 12 or younger. If the PCP contracts with more than one AHCCCS health
plan, the ratio shall be adjusted by the Contractor to ensure the total number
of AHCCCS members does not exceed the above ratio. The Contractor should
consider the PCP's total patient panel size (i.e. AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS
patients) when assessing the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS' appointment and other
standards. In addition, AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of the
PCP's panel of patients. The Contractor shall also reduce the number of members
assigned to its network PCPs as necessary to meet the appointment standards
specified in Section D, Paragraph 19, Appointment Standards. Any variation to
the above standards must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management
for prior approval. PCPs with assigned members diagnosed with AIDS or as
HIV-positive shall meet criteria and standards set forth in AHCCCS Medical
Policy and AHCCCS AIDS Advisory Committee Guidelines.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data regarding
PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign members with
complex medical conditions who are age 12 and younger to Board-certified
pediatricians.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice in selecting a PCP. When a new member has been assigned to the
Contractor, the Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment
and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's receipt of
notification of assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include with the
enrollment notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs and the
process for changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so. The
Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to the member. Members may
make both their initial PCP selection and any subsequent PCP changes either
verbally or in writing.


                                       39
<PAGE>

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a.       Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member
b.       Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care
c.       Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member
d.       Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
         services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
         referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational
audits. PCPs and specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's
members shall have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one
general acute care hospital that is located within the Contractor's service
area.

23. OTHER PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to:

a.       Recruit sufficient specialty physicians, dentists, health care
         professionals, health care institutions and support services to meet
         the medical needs of its members.
b.       Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
         network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of
         care to members with limited proficiency in English.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

For specialty services, the Contractor shall ensure that:

a.       PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except
         that women shall have direct access to GYN providers without a referral
         for preventive and routine services. Any waiver of this requirement by
         the Contractor must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.
b.       Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a
         medical condition other than that for which the member was referred,
         unless approved by the member's PCP.
c.       The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP complete
         documentation of all diagnostic services including copies of test
         results if applicable, treatment services provided and the resulting
         outcome for each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.       Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are
         general practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics
b.       Certified nurse midwives
c.       Licensed midwives.


                                       40
<PAGE>

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric care (physician
or certified nurse midwife). Such assignment shall be consistent with the
freedom of choice requirements for selecting health care professionals while
ensuring that the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a
PCP for medical care as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges. Licensed midwives perform deliveries only in the member's
home. Labor and delivery services may also be provided in the member's home by
physicians and certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.

24. NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient personnel for the
provision of covered services, including emergency medical care on a
24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall be sufficient to
provide covered services within designated time and distance limits. For
Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that 95% of its
members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson do
not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP or pharmacy. 95% of its
members residing outside the boundary area must not have to travel more than 10
miles to see such providers. See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for
details on network requirements by Geographic Service Area. Also see Section D,
Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for details on changes
in hospital subcontracting effective October 1, 1998.

Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall not discriminate
with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program, reimbursement or
indemnification against any provider based solely on the provider's type of
licensure or certification. This provision, however, does not prohibit the
Contractor from limiting provider participation to the extent necessary to meet
the needs of the Contractor's members. This provision also does not interfere
with measures established by the Contractor to control costs consistent with its
responsibilities under this contract.

25. NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertains to all
service specifications described in the AMPM, Chapters 300, 600 and 900. In
addition, the Contractor shall have policies on how the Contractor will:

a.       Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program
         changes and requirements
b.       Monitor and control network compliance with policies and rules of
         AHCCCSA and the Contractor, including compliance with all policies and
         procedures related to the grievance process and ensuring the member's
         care is not compromised during the grievance process.
c.       Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network
d.       Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
         network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service
         area
e.       Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient providers
         to handle the volume of members
f.       Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring appointment
         procedures standards, appointment waiting times, and service provision
         standards


                                       41
<PAGE>

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one,
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract. The
Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned material changes in the
provider network before the change process has begun, for example before issuing
a 60-day termination notice to a provider. The notification shall be made within
one working day if the change is unexpected. AHCCCSA will assess proposed
changes in the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members'
health care and provide a written response to the Contractor within 14 days of
receipt of request. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care if the provider network change is likely to result in
deficient delivery of covered services.

26. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the federal mandates. This legislation gives FQHCs the
option to require state Medicaid programs to reimburse the FQHC at 100% of
reasonable costs for the services delivered to Title XIX members. Effective
4/1/01, Title XIX Waiver members will also be eligible for reasonable cost
reimbursement. AHCCCSA and its contractors are required to comply with this
legislation. The following payment methodology for reasonable cost reimbursement
was implemented effective October 1, 1997.

If the FQHC elects reasonable cost reimbursement, the FQHC will receive a
quarterly payment per Title XIX member per month from AHCCCSA. The initial
capitation amount will be $1.75 PMPM statewide. In accordance with the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 and BBA Refinements Legislation, this additional
reimbursement will be phased out over a five-year period beginning in contract
year ending 2000:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
         Contract Year             Phase-Out Percentage             PMPM Amount
         <S>                        <C>                                <C>
         1997 through 1999          No phase-out                       $ 1.75
         2000                       95%                                $ 1.66
         2001                       95%                                $ 1.66
         2002                       95%                                $ 1.66
         2003                       90%                                $ 1.58
         2004                       85%                                $ 1.49
         2005                        0%                                $ 0.00
</TABLE>

Contractors are required to submit member month information for Title XIX
members for each FQHC on a quarterly basis to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care.
AHCCCSA will perform periodic audits of the member month information submitted.
Contractors should refer to the Office of Managed Care's policy on FQHC
reimbursement for further guidance. The following FQHCs are currently recognized
by HCFA:

                  Ajo Community Health Center
                  Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc.
                  Clinica Adelante, Inc.
                  El Rio Health Center

                  Center, Inc.)
                  United Community Health Center, Inc.

Any other clinics that subsequently become FQHCs will be subject to the
reimbursement methodology described above upon electing reasonable cost
reimbursement from AHCCCSA.

27. PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number. A
Provider Participation Agreement must be signed with each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

28. PROVIDER AFFILIATION TAPE

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Tape User Manual on October 15, January 15, April 15, and
July 15 of each contract year. The Manual may be found in the Bidder's Library.

29. PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its HCFA grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

a.       Timeliness:       Reports or other required data shall be received on
         or before scheduled due dates.

b.       Accuracy:         Reports or other required data shall be prepared in
         strict conformity with appropriate authoritative sources and/or AHCCCS
         defined standards.

c.       Completeness:     All required information shall be fully disclosed in
         a manner that is both responsive and pertinent to report intent with no
         material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.


                                       43
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

30. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA, or the federal government, to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials that are produced by the Contractor and refer
to covered services shall state that such services are funded under contract
with AHCCCSA.

31. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.

32. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business for the initial contract year beginning 10/1/97.
The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess new contractors' readiness and
ability to provide contract services to members at the start of the contract
year. A new contractor will be permitted to commence operations only if the
Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's satisfaction.

33. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with HCFA requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular Operational
and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not limited to) ensuring
operational and financial program compliance. The Reviews will identify areas
where improvements can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and provide the
Contractor with technical assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply
with all other medical audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and
R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel as identified in advance shall be
available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA or
any other nationally


                                       44
<PAGE>

recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the entire NCQA report
to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and Financial Review
Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior to
AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review findings
may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements must be implemented by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to
determine the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations and
achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be conducted at any time
after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

34. CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-705, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. In the absence
of a subcontract provision to the contrary, claims submission deadlines shall be
calculated from the date of service or the effective date of eligibility
posting, whichever is later. Remittance advices accompanying the Contractor's
payments to providers must contain, at a minimum, adequate descriptions of all
denials and adjustments, the reasons for such denials and adjustments, the
amount billed, the amount paid, and grievance and request for hearing rights.
The Contractor's claims payment system, as well as its prior authorization and
concurrent review process, must minimize the likelihood of having to recoup
already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess of $50,000 per provider within a
contract year must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, unless a subcontract
specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall ensure that 90% of all clean claims
are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid within 90
days of receipt of the clean claim.

During the term of this contract, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring all health plans
to use a standardized electronic format for electronic claims processing between
the plan and its providers. AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the
Technical Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by FFS providers and their billing agents who submit claims
electronically to AHCCCS. The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts will be supplemented
by a Form C layout. All formats are subject to changes as required by federal
law. Reasonable implementation timeframes will be negotiated with each plan.

35. HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals for member care in accordance with
AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is encouraged to obtain contracts with
hospitals in all GSA's and must submit copies of these contracts to AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care, at least seven days prior to the effective dates
thereof.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical reviews of all
hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously paid claims are subject to
recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack of medical necessity
through concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review, lack of medical
necessity


                                       45
<PAGE>

identified during postpayment medical review shall not constitute a basis for
recoupment by the Contractor. See also Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment
System. For a more complete description of the guidelines for hospital
reimbursement, please consult the Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and
rules.

FOR OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state
hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

36. NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility
described above applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. To further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member
could be ALTCS eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that
occurs on the same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of services while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor. The Contractor is not responsible for the full 90 days of nursing
facility coverage if ALTCS enrollment occurs before the 90 days has ended.

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in a
nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If
the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program
Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing facility coverage,
the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility coverage during the time
the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing facility services covered by
a third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

37. COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, delivery supplement, HIV-AIDS
supplement, reinsurance (PPC and prospective), and third party liability, as
described and defined within this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or
policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer nor indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, and as
otherwise specified in this section, any savings


                                       46
<PAGE>

remaining to the Contractor as a result of favorable claims experience and
efficiencies in service delivery at the end of the contract term may be kept by
the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be separately
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund, as described in A.R.S. ss.36-2913. An error discovered by the State with
or without an audit in the amount of fees paid to Contractor will be subject to
adjustment or repayment by Contractor making a corresponding decrease in a
current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment by AHCCCSA to
the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the Contractor. This
section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from making payment to a
fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required copayment from
members but service will not be denied for inability to pay the copayment.
Except for permitted copayments, the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not
bill or attempt to collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all PPC member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during prior period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation
described below. Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of
members who were enrolled at the time of delivery.

RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For CYE '98 and CYE '99, AHCCCSA
will offer a reconciliation process for contractors whose total PPC medical cost
experience (excluding administrative and non-operating expenses) is more than
10% higher than the reimbursement associated with PPC in two areas: the "retro"
portion of the capitation rate for all rate categories, and the prospective
three-day notification period for MN/MI recipients only. Expenses will be net of
reinsurance for both the retro and prospective period.

AHCCCSA will reimburse 100% of a Contractor's excess reasonable costs in excess
of a 10% limit as determined by reported encounters. AHCCCS will recoup profit
amounts in excess of a 10% limit.

For CYE '00 and `01, a full reconciliation to 0% profit or loss will be done by
AHCCCSA for the same eligibility time periods and risk groups noted above.
AHCCCSA will reimburse the health plans 100% of any excess reasonable costs as
determined by reported encounters, and all profits will be recouped. Refer to
the Office of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further details of
the reconciliation process.


DELIVERY SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home.


HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: On a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA shall utilize encounters to
determine the number of members receiving approved HIV/AIDS drugs and calculate
the amount of the supplemental payment. The


                                       47
<PAGE>

rate of reimbursement for this separate per member per month payment is
specified in Section B and is subject to review during the term of the contract.
AHCCCSA reserves the right to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members as
determined through an encounter data review as well as an associated penalty for
incorrect encounter reporting.

Refer to the Office of Managed Care's HIV/AIDS supplemental payment and review
policies for further details and requirements.

38. CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

INCENTIVE FUND: AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of capitation
reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors based on their performance
measure outcomes. AHCCCSA will notify Contractors 60 days prior to a new
contract year if this methodology will be implemented and will provide details
of the reimbursement methodology at that time.

CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS: Except for changes made specifically in accordance with
this contract, the rates set forth in Section B shall not be subject to
re-negotiation or modification during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its
option, review the effect of a program change and determine if a capitation
adjustment is needed. In these instances the adjustment will be prospective with
assumptions discussed with the Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates.
The Contractor may request a review of a program change if it believes the
program change was not equitable; AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a
review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a.       death of a member
b.       member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date
         of incarceration)
c.       duplicate capitation to the same contractor
d.       adjustment based on change in member's contract type

If a member is enrolled twice with the same contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39. REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program
provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered
inpatient facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical
condition beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503 and R9-31-503). Per
diem rates paid for nursing facility services, including room and board,
provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall
be eligible for reinsurance coverage. Refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Prospective reinsurance coverage applies to prospective enrollment periods. The
deductible level is based on the Contractor's


                                       48
<PAGE>

statewide AHCCCS acute care enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning
Extension services) as of October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and
counties, as shown in the following table. No changes to the deductibles will be
made due to Proposition 204. These deductible levels are subject to change by
AHCCCSA during the term of this contract. Any change would have a corresponding
impact on capitation rates.

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

A Contractor whose enrollment qualifies for the $35,000 or $50,000 non-MN/MI
deductible level may, prior to the start of the contract period, elect one of
the lower deductible levels indicated in the above table. Contractors may not
elect to increase their deductible level. If a Contractor's actual non-MN/MI
deductible is $35,000 or $50,000, AHCCCSA will increase the Contractor's
capitation rate awarded by defined amounts for each capitation risk group. These
specific capitation adjustments are available from the Office of Managed Care.

Prior Period Coverage Reinsurance: A separate reinsurance deductible and
coinsurance percentage will apply during prior period coverage. As noted in the
table above, all Contractors, regardless of enrollment, will be subject to a
$5,000 deductible level. The coinsurance percentage for the prior period
coverage reinsurance is 100%. Expenses incurred during prior period coverage
will not apply toward the prospective reinsurance thresholds.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance benefits. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide
for a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used
in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.

Effective October 1, 1998, when a member changes Contractors within a contract
year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs incurred for that
member will follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all
submitted encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of
service within the current contract year) will be applied toward the receiving
health plan's deductible level. For further details regarding this policy and
other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing
Manual. Medical review on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance
cases will be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random
sampling. AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, will generate the sampling and
will notify the Contractor of documentation needed for the retrospective medical
review process to occur at the Contractor's offices. Reinsurance consideration
will be given to inpatient facility contracts, and hearing decisions rendered by
the Office of Legal Assistance. Pre-hearing and/or hearing penalties
discoverable during the review process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance.
A recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor will occur
based on the results of the medical review sampling. The results of the medical
review sampling will be separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and
prior period coverage reinsurance reimbursement populations in the review time
frame for the Contractor. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days
advance notice of any on-site review. The Contractor shall have all requested
medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall
be made available upon request of the Review Team during the course of the
review. The Contractor


                                       49
<PAGE>

representative shall be available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA
on-site review activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the
Review Team with workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and
privacy for conferences. The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the
Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the onsite review and given an
opportunity to comment on any review findings.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia, von Willebrand's Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. This program
also covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and tissue
transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver, kidney,
and other organ transplantation. For additional detail and restrictions refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All catastrophic claims are
subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, Reinsurance
Unit, of cases identified for catastrophic non-transplant reinsurance coverage
within 30 days of (a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and
(c) the beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid
for a maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to
AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When a member is identified as being catastrophically eligible by
AHCCCSA due to the specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1,
286.2), all medically necessary covered services provided during the contract
year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders and
dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify AHCCCS
Office of Medical Management Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis. All medically
necessary covered services provided during the contract year shall be eligible
for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy. All medically necessary covered services provided during
the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's
paid amount.

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts and cornea transplantation services are not eligible
for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the regular
(non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM, Chapter 300 for
covered services for organ and tissue transplants. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount,
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library. When a member is referred to a transplant facility for an
AHCCCS-covered organ transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of
Medical Management.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits
for transplants. However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the
responsibility for submitting encounters for all catastrophic reinsurance
services.

All reinsurance claims must be submitted in accordance with R9-22-703 and the
AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

40. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY


                                       50
<PAGE>

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and postpayment recovery. See Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare
Services and Cost Sharing.

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor's
network. The Contractor's liability for coinsurance and deductibles is limited
to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service pursuant to a
written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service rate, less any
amount paid by the third party. (The Contractor must decide whether it is more
cost-effective to provide the service within its network or pay coinsurance and
deductibles for a service outside its network. For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its network.) If the
Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer (other than
Medicare), and the insurer requires payment in advance of all copayments,
coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so. (See also Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
pre-natal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits. Further, if a
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost
avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that
the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use
of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The Contractor shall identify
all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except
in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the
following circumstances unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by
AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                   <C>
Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance             Adoption recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance             Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors                                           Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery
</TABLE>

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002 and R9-31-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In
joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related


                                       51
<PAGE>

costs, subsequent to the referral of any and all relevant case information to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative by the Contractor. AHCCCSA's authorized
representative is also responsible for negotiating and acting in the best
interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases and may
compromise a settlement in order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal
and other costs. For total plan cases involving only payments from the
Contractor, the Contractor is responsible for performing all research,
investigation, the filing of liens and payment of lien filing fees and other
related costs. The Contractor shall use the cover sheet as prescribed by AHCCCS
when filing liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a.       Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
         Contractor's financial liability for the member
b.       There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
         reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.)
c.       Such recovery is not prohibited by state or federal law

REPORTING: The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. In addition, upon AHCCCSA's request, the Contractor shall
provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed
cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member's first and
last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount; paid/recovered amount;
and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide the format and reporting
schedule for this information to the Contractor. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working days of the
identification of a third-party liability case with reinsurance. Failure to
report reinsurance cases may result in one of the remedies specified in
Paragraph 60 (Sanctions) of Section D. The Contractor shall communicate any
known change in health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the
date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the
Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a complete
file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for the
purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA
of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by
AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE): Eligibility for KidsCare benefits requires that the
applicant/member not be enrolled with or entitled to any other health insurance
benefits. If the Contractor becomes aware of any such potential coverage, the
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. The Contractor shall follow the
same cost avoidance and postpayment recovery practices for the KidsCare
population as it does for the Title XIX population, and shall maintain a
reporting system which allows Title XIX and KidsCare information to be reported
separately.

CONTRACT TERMINATION. Upon termination of this contract, the Contractor will
complete the existing third party liability cases or make any necessary
arrangements to transfer the cases to AHCCCSA's authorized TPL representative.

41. MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligible". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost


                                       52
<PAGE>

sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. The Contractor is responsible for adhering to the cost sharing
responsibilities presented in the AHCCCS Medicare Cost Sharing policy. Effective
10/1/97, the Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare
payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same service of a
non-Medicare member.

42. COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-711 and R9-31-711. Beginning 4/1/01, all
copayment amounts for MNMI's will be the same as current Title XIX copayment
amounts. The Contractor may not collect copayments for family planning and EPSDT
services.

43. RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all reasonable times
during the term of this contract and the period set forth in paragraphs a. and
b. below any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by any
authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or federal government.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract except as provided
in paragraphs a. and b. below:

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to
the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for a period of five
years from the date of any such termination. Records which relate to grievances,
disputes, litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the performance
of this contract, or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has
been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of five
years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44. MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 working days
of receipt of request. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical
record is established when information is received about a member. If the PCP
has not yet seen the member, such information may be kept temporarily in an
appropriately labeled file, in lieu of actually establishing a medical record,
but must be associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is
established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.


                                       53
<PAGE>
The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 working days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member if the reason for such request is directly related to the
administration of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed. (A.R.S. ss. 36-664I)

45. ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the Office of Managed Care.

46. ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSAs as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

47. DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines which is available in the Bidder's Library. The information
so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all procedures,
policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this contract. If any
of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter
changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by


                                       54
<PAGE>

Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted
input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for
any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous
input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
describes the specific technical and procedural requirements for interfaces
between AHCCCS and the Contractor and its subcontractors. The Contractor is
responsible for complying with all technical requirements as stated in this
manual as well as any subsequent changes to the manual. A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI): In addition to the requirements outlined in
Section D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System, the Contractor will be required
to comply with all administrative simplification provisions resulting from the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The administrative
simplification section standardizes electronic transaction formats and code
sets; establishes national identifiers for providers, employers, health plans,
and individuals; and sets standards for security and privacy. Each of these
provisions will be published as one or more Final Rules in the Federal Register.
Implementation of these provisions will be required two years after the
effective date of each provision's final rule as published by the Department of
Health and Human Services.

48. ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance measures. The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered services for
which the Contractor incurred a financial liability, including services provided
during prior period coverage. This requirement is a condition of the HCFA grant
award.


                                       55
<PAGE>

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats. Formatting and specific
requirements for encounter data are described in the AHCCCS Encounter Reporting
User Manual and the AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines, copies of which may
be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission Requirements are
included herein as Attachment I.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available to
AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim to an
adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found in The Encounter
User's Manual.

49. MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and changes to
members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the Contractor
shall use to update its member records. The daily roster which is run prior to
the monthly roster is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate
code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end of every month.
The roster will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of
the first day of the next month. This roster contains the information used by
AHCCCSA to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month. The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly roster.
After reconciling the monthly roster information, the Contractor resumes posting
daily roster updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month.

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
available in the Bidder's Library for additional information.

50. TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through 9/30/98. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the sole option to extend the term of the contract, not to
exceed a total contracting period of five years. The terms and conditions of any
such contract extension shall remain the same as the original contract, as
amended. Any contract extension, however, shall not affect the maximum
contracting period of five years. All contract extensions shall be through
contract amendment. If, in conjunction with a contract extension, AHCCCSA elects
to increase the capitation rate for any risk category, such increase will not
exceed in aggregate the inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another. Further,
AHCCCSA may require a contractor to renew all GSAs, or may terminate remaining
GSAs if the Contractor does not agree to renew all GSAs.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the provisions of such
extension will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the extension amendment has not been signed by the
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing
that it refuses


                                       56
<PAGE>

to sign the extension amendment. If the Contractor provides such notification,
AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 180 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

51. SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See policy on claims processing by
subcontracted providers in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing, and shall incorporate by
reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The following subcontracts
shall be submitted to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30
days prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.  Automated data processing
b.  Third-party administrators
c.  Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)
d.  Model subcontracts
e.  Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
    subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts,
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is violable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA. All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of federal and State laws,
regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider the
Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing services on its behalf more
than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions to this requirement include
the following:

a.  If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the contract
    year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the Contractor, the
    Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal to AHCCCS Office of
    Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt to gain such agreement.
b.  If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
    physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.


                                       57
<PAGE>

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the
provisions of Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each
subcontract must contain the following:

a.  Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
    consideration to be received by the subcontractor.
b.  Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.
c.  Identification of the population, to include patient capacity, to be covered
    by the subcontractor.
d.  The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be provided, and for
    which compensation will be paid.
e.  The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending dates, methods of
    extension, termination and re-negotiation.
f.  The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of
    benefits and determination of third-party liability.
g.  A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and other
    third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or third party
    liability payment before submitting claims to the Contractor.
h.  A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
    keeping system.
i.  Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality assurance
    programs and comply with the utilization control and review procedures
    specified in 42 CFR Part 456, as implemented by AHCCCSA.
j.  A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in ownership of
    a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the Contractor shall
    require a contract amendment and prior approval of AHCCCSA.
k.  Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population (may
    also refer to the Provider Manual).
l.  A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all tax
    obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other applicable
    insurance coverage obligations which arise under this subcontract, for
    itself and its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or
    liability for any such taxes or insurance coverage.
m.  A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary authorization
    from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to eligible and/or
    enrolled members.
n.  A provision that the subcontractor must comply with encounter reporting and
    claims submission requirements as described in the subcontract.

52. SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over and supersede existing and future subcontracts for services
that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving this
requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement for
transplant surgery exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty
contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts.

AHCCCSA shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor
prior to the implementation of any specialty contract.


                                       58
<PAGE>

53. MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA Contracting Office as described in
Section D, Paragraph 51, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must be submitted
with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or corporate
allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are determined to
be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment to the
Contractor, the Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or
financial sanctions may be imposed.

54. MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a consultant or actuary
are less than $50,000, AHCCCSA will waive the requirement for an audit of that
consultant or actuary.

55. MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 15 days after contract
award.

Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
         Geographic Service Area               Capitalization Requirement
         <S>                                   <C>
         GSA #2    Yuma                                $1,400,000
         GSA #4    Mohave, La Paz                       1,150,000
         GSA #6    Yavapai, Coconino                    1,250,000
         GSA #8    Pinal, Gila                          1,450,000
         GSA #10   Pima                                 1,250,000
         GSA #12   Maricopa                             2,500,000
         GSA #14   Graham, Greenlee                       350,000
         GSA #16   Apache, Navajo                         650,000
         GSA #18   Cochise, Santa Cruz                  1,450,000
</TABLE>

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSAs, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSAs awarded. This requirement is in addition to the
Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57 below and must be
met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirements may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.


                                       59
<PAGE>

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA that
they are currently servicing must meet the equity per member standard (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) for their current
membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must fund
through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet this requirement.
Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional
capitalization for the new GSA they are bidding. (See the table of requirements
by GSA above). Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their
existing membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $5,000,000 in equity.

56. PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to
providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance by
the Contractor of its obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond
shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS Performance
Bond policy available in the Office of Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a. Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers and
nonproviders by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under this
contract,

b.  Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of
the Contractor, and

c.  Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative
expenses incurred by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
this contract, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after
termination of this contract for reasons other than the convenience of the State
by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor may not change
the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without prior written
approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or create other
creditors using the bond as security.

57. AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid in the month of October 1997, or as
determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include SOBRA
supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied by the Contractor not
later than 15 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the amount required.
Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics of the Contractor
on a monthly basis. If there is an increase in capitation payment that


                                       60
<PAGE>

exceeds 10% of the performance bond amount, AHCCCSA may require an increase in
the amount of the Performance Bond. The Contractor shall have 15 days following
notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Performance Bond amount that must be maintained after the contract term shall be
sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by
AHCCCSA. The Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond
without prior written approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. Due to
increased enrollment as a result of Proposition 204, required performance bond
amounts will be reviewed for 10/1/01.

58. FINANCIAL VIABILITY CRITERIA/PERFORMANCE MEASURES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability criteria/performance
goals:

<TABLE>
<S>                                   <C>
CURRENT RATIO                         Current assets divided by current
                                      liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
                                      long-term investments that can be
                                      converted to cash within 24 hours without
                                      significant penalty (i.e., greater than
                                      20%).
                                      Standard: At least 1.00

EQUITY PER MEMBER                     Equity, less on-balance sheet performance
                                      bond, divided by the number of non-SOBRA
                                      Family Planning Extension Services members
                                      enrolled at the end of the period.
                                      Standard: At least $150
                                      (Failure to meet this standard may result
                                      in an enrollment cap being imposed in any
                                      or all contracted GSAs.)

MEDICAL EXPENSE RATIO                 Total medical expenses (net of
                                      reinsurance, TPL, HIV/AIDS Supplement)
                                      divided by total capitation + Delivery
                                      Supplement.
                                      Standard:  At least 85%

ADMINISTRATIVE COST PERCENTAGE        Total administrative expenses (excluding
                                      income taxes), divided by total capitation
                                      + Delivery Supplement + TPL + reinsurance
                                      + HIV/AIDS Supplement.
                                      Standard: No more than 10%

RECEIVED BUT UNPAID CLAIMS            Received but unpaid claims divided by the

                                      period, net of sub-capitation expense
                                      Standard: No more than 30 days
</TABLE>

59. MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract
amendment. The Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or
transition plan to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review. The purpose of
the plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new
entity's ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to
members are not diminished and that major components of the organization and
AHCCCS programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or
change in ownership.


                                       61
<PAGE>

60. SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may impose sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or terminate this
contract or any related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-405
and 406 and R9-31-405 and 406 and the terms of this contract and applicable
federal or State law and regulations. Written notice will be provided to the
Contractor specifying the sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction
and either the length of suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be
withheld. The Contractor may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-804.

In addition to the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose partial or
full enrollment caps on the Contractor. Among the contract violations that may
result in an enrollment cap are, but are not limited to, the following:

a.  Marketing violations
b.  Failure to meet AHCCCS financial viability standards
c.  Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network
d.  Quality of care and quality management issues
e.  Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards

CURE NOTICE PROCESS - Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of sanctions.

61. AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a contractor or members who have the
right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to contractors
through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various contractors in a manner that is
predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm favors those
contractors with lower capitation rates. For further details on the AHCCCS
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA may change the
algorithm at any time during the term of the contract and frequently does so in
response to contractor-specific issues of non-compliance (e.g. imposition of an
enrollment cap). The Contractor should consider this in preparing its response
to this RFP. AHCCCSA is not obligated to adjust for any financial impacts this
may have on the Contractor.

62. GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance policy for members and
providers, which defines their rights regarding any adverse action by the
Contractor. This written policy shall be in accordance with applicable federal
and State law and AHCCCS Rules and policy including, but not limited to, AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-512; R9-22-518(A); R9-22, Article 8 and R9-31, Article 8 , the
Alternate Resolution Process and the Members Rights and Responsibilities. The
grievance process may not be delegated or subcontracted outside of the health
plan. Refer to Attachment H for a complete description of grievance process
requirements.


                                       62
<PAGE>

63. QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly Grievance Report Format on file in the
Bidder's Library. The Quarterly Grievance Report must be received by the
AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance, no later than 45 days from the end of the
quarter.

64. KIDSCARE

On November 1, 1998, AHCCCSA implemented a Title XXI Children's Health Insurance
Program, referred to as "KidsCare". KidsCare provides health care coverage
statewide to eligible children under age 19 and is provided through the existing
AHCCCS health plans, state employee HMOs that elect to participate at the
beginning of a contract cycle, and tribal facilities or Indian Health Service
for Native Americans who elect to receive services through them. Services will
also be directly provided by participating community health clinics and
hospitals, which predominantly serve low income children.

The KidsCare service package is established by the legislature and approved by
HCFA through the State Plan. Services, limitations and exclusions are described
in Section D, Paragraph 1, Scope of Services. Capitation rates payable to the
Contractor for KidsCare members will be set by AHCCCSA in conjunction with an
independent actuary.

Effective October 1, 1999, KidsCare members in families with gross household
income over 150% and up to 200% of the federal poverty limit shall pay a premium
to AHCCCSA. The premium amount shall be based on the number of members in the
household and the gross family income in accordance with 9 A.A.C., Article 14.

TITLE XXI PARENT/GUARDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: A.R.S. ss.36.2984 mandates
that the Contractor offer health insurance coverage to the parent(s) or legal
guardian(s) of a child who is eligible for Title XXI. The Contractor shall
establish rates for this coverage, which must be approved by AHCCCSA, Office of
Managed Care, prior to implementation. Title XXI funds or any other federal or
state funds shall not be used to subsidize family coverage. The full cost of the
premium shall be paid by the parent or legal guardian who elects this coverage.
The Contractor may include provisions for pre-existing conditions and any other
medical underwriting considerations that are necessary to protect it from
adverse risk. For further information, refer to the Title XXI Parent/Guardian
Health Insurance Coverage Guidelines on file in the Bidder's Library.

65. PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

In addition to the requirements described in this RFP, there are several
legislative issues that could have an impact on services provided by the
Contractor on or after October 1, 2000. The following is a brief description of
the issues that AHCCCS is aware of at the time of the issuance of this renewal
amendment:

ELIGIBILITY BASED ON 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL): Through a
successful initiative effort, eligibility for AHCCCS has been expanded to allow
persons with income up to 100% of the FPL to become eligible for the Medicaid
program. Some legislative action will be required to fully implement this new
eligibility guideline. In January 2001, HCFA approved the waiver to federally
fund members eligible due to Proposition 204.

66. SEPARATE INCORPORATION

As specified in A.R.S. ss. 36-2906.01, within 60 days of contract award, a
non-governmental Contractor shall have established a separate corporation for
the purposes of this contract, whose sole activity is the performance of
contract function with AHCCCS.

67. CULTURAL COMPETENCY

The Contractor shall have a Cultural Competency Plan that meets the requirements
of the AHCCCS Cultural Competency Policy. The Contractor must identify a staff
member responsible for the cultural competency plan and inform the office of
Managed Care of that person's identity.

68. MEDICAID IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Arizona Department of
Education, AHCCCS will begin paying participating school districts for
specifically identified Medicaid services provided to Medicaid eligible children
with special educational needs. The Medicaid service shall be identified in a
child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) as a medically necessary service. In
the first phase, AHCCCS shall directly reimburse school districts for speech,
physical, occupational therapies, and behavioral health services with dates of
service beginning July 1, 2000. The Administration's intent is to add other
Medicaid reimbursable services in the future.

To ensure that there is coordination of care, the Administration shall require
that a participating school district notify the primary care provider that
Medicaid services are being provided to the child in a school-based setting. If
a child is enrolled with the Contractor and a request is made for a school-based
Medicaid covered service, the Contractor shall evaluate the request on the same
basis as any request for a covered service. The determination to provide the
service shall include consideration of whether the school-based services are
sufficient to meet the child's needs.

69. PROPOSITION 204 AND HCFA WAIVER

The passage of Proposition 204 in November of 2000, and the subsequent HCFA
waiver that raises the Medicaid eligibility limit to 100% Federal Poverty Level
for all populations has multiple effects on the program. The most significant
changes to AHCCCS acute care contractors are described below.

MNMI POPULATION

-   Beginning 4/1/01, the MNMI population will no longer be funded solely with
    state dollars. The program will be Federally funded under Medicaid through
    the Title XIX Waiver. However, until 10/1/01, the enrollment and eligibility
    determination processes will not change.

-   Length of eligibility.

    -   For members enrolled as of 4/01/01.

        -   Non-spend down MNMI's will have twelve months of eligibility.
        -   Spend-down MNMI's will continue to have six months of eligibility.


                                       64
<PAGE>

    -   For members enrolled on or after 4/01/01.

        -   Non-spend down MNMI's will have open ended enrollment.
        -   Spend-down MNMI's will continue to have up to six months of
            enrollment.

-   Beginning 4/1/01, the service package will match the current Title XIX
    service package, including

    -   Full behavioral health coverage
    -   Full coverage during the two day prior period coverage time period.

-   Beginning 10/1/01, Title XIX Waiver members will be divided into two main
    groups:

    -   MED (Medical Expense Deduction). These are people that have income above
        100% FPL that spend down to or below 40% of 2000 FPL. Generally, these
        are the current medically needy (MN) population.
    -   Adults and couples who are not categorically linked to a Title XIX
        program, and have income at or below 100% FPL. This group includes the
        current medically indigent (MI) population.

-   Beginning 10/1/01, the Title XIX Waiver group, including MED's, will get a
    six-month enrollment guarantee.

-   Beginning 10/1/01, the MED population will no longer have a two-day
    retroactive enrollment period (PPC). Their eligibility effective date will
    be the date on which they spent down. Prior period coverage will extend from
    the date that AHCCCSA is notified that the member spent down, to the date of
    spend down. Often notification to AHCCCSA and spend down will occur on the
    same day.

-   Beginning 10/1/01, Non-MED Title XIX Waiver members' retroactive enrollment
    rules will follow the current Title XIX retroactive enrollment rules.

NEW POPULATIONS

-   See paragraph 6, Enrollment and Disenrollment, for population timelines.

REIMBURSEMENT

-   Reinsurance deductibles will not change between 4/1/01 and 10/1/01. They
    will be reviewed during normal contract renewal during the summer of 2001.

-   AHCCCSA reserves the right to make prospective capitation rate adjustments
    if increased enrollment affects the actuarial soundness of the rates.

intend to perform or continue performing this contract, the procurement officer
may demand in writing that the Contractor give a written assurance of intent to
perform. The demand shall be sent to the Contractor by certified mail, return
receipt required. Failure by the Contractor to provide written assurance within
the number of days specified in the demand may, at the State's option, be the
basis for terminating the contract.

15) TERMINATION FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST

AHCCCSA may cancel this contract without penalty or further obligation if any
person significantly involved in initiating, negotiating, securing, drafting or
creating the contract on behalf of AHCCCSA is, or becomes at any time while the

matter of the contract. The cancellation shall be effective when the Contractor
receives written notice of the cancellation unless the notice specifies a later

16) GRATUITIES

AHCCCSA may, by written notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate this

securing the contract, an amendment to the contract, or favorable treatment
concerning the contract, including the making of any determination or decision

Contractor shall be entitled to receive just and equitable compensation for work

the failure of the Contractor to comply with any term or condition of the
contract or failure to take corrective action as required by AHCCCSA to comply
with the terms of the contract. If the Contractor is providing services under
more than one contract with AHCCCSA, AHCCCSA may deem unsatisfactory performance
under one contract to be cause to require the Contractor to provide assurance of
performance under any and all other contracts. In such situations, AHCCCSA
reserves the right to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches
of contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received. The
Contracting Officer shall mail written notice of the termination and the
reason(s) for it to the Contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested.

required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to oversee the operation of the

by the Contractor under the contract shall become the property of and be
delivered to AHCCCSA on demand.

AHCCCSA may, upon termination of this contract, procure, on terms and in the

of the contract or Contractor is insolvent, AHCCCSA may directly operate
Contractor to assure delivery of care to members enrolled with Contractor until
cure by Contractor of its breach, by demonstrated financial solvency or until
the successful transition of those members to other contractors.

If AHCCCS undertakes direct operation of the Contractor, AHCCCS, through
designees appointed by the Director shall be vested with full and exclusive

uninterrupted care to persons and accomplish the orderly transition of persons
to a new or existing Contractor, or until the Contractor corrects the Contract

Medicare and Medicaid (AHCCCS) programs. In addition, they must meet all the

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical laboratories to

provider registration process. Failure to do so shall result in either a
termination of an active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

above requirements are prohibited. Prime contractor may not reimburse providers
who do not comply with the above requirements.

employees as provided herein. Furthermore, the Contractor shall be fully
responsible for all tax obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all
other applicable insurance coverage, for itself and its employees, and AHCCCSA

coverage.

ATTACHMENT I:  ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any
findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the imposition
of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

PENDED ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days of the
original processing date. Sanctions will be imposed according to the following
schedule for each encounter pended for more than 120 days unless the pend is due
to AHCCCSA error:

<TABLE>
<S>                  <C>                    <C>                    <C>                    <C>
0 - 120 days         121 - 180 days         181 - 240 days         241 - 360 days         361 + days
No sanction          $5 per month           $10 per month          $15 per month          $20 per month
</TABLE>

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter which (1) AHCCCSA acknowledges
to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the system
programming, an update to the database reference table, or further research by
AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that the resolution of a pended
encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will respond in
writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA response
will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the
total number of sanctionable encounters pended more than 120 days.
Pended encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 120 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon request,
make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

ENCOUNTER VALIDATION STUDIES

Per HCFA requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data. Any and
all covered services may be validated as part of these studies. Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.

The following reflects AHCCCSA's encounter validation study process and sanction
policy as of 10/1/97. AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and
sanction amounts based on agency review or as a


                                      I-1
<PAGE>

result of consultations with HCFA. The Contractor will be notified in writing of
any significant change in study methodology.

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records requested
within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If
AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from the
Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date that the
encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be received by AHCCCSA no
later than 240 days after the end of the month in which the service was
rendered, or the effective date of enrollment with the Contractor, whichever is
later. For all encounters for which timeliness is evaluated, a sanction per
encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if
the encounter record is received by AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date
determined above. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per
error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has changed, or if
HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the
sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate description of
AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction per encounter error
extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter is
incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will
be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however,
sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality
has changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be
notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the
studies begin.

Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or historical
files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A" and for Study "B", a
sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
assessed for an omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be
$5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and
$10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "B";
however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter
quality has changed, or if HCFA changes sanction requirements. The Contractor
will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time
the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors


                                      I-2
<PAGE>

found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval will be
used to account for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence interval
shows the range within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If error
rates are based on a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes will be
the lower limit of the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples, which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to HCFA, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance and request for hearing pursuant to Article
8 of AHCCCS Rules. Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's
capitation payment.

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

Contractors are required to submit adjusted or voided encounters in the event
that claims are subsequently adjusted or denied after the initial encounter
submission. This includes adjustments for inaccuracies identified by fraud and
abuse audits or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA or the Contractor.
Contractors shall refer to the Encounter User's Manual for further instructions
regarding adjustments to encounters.

                         SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1.       SCOPE OF SERVICES

The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by reference in
attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document. The services are
described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R 9-22, Article 2, the AHCCCS Medical Policy
Manual (AMPM), and the document entitled "AHCCCS Health Plan Performance
Indicators", all of which are incorporated herein by reference and may be found
in the Bidder's Library. The covered services are briefly described below.
Covered services must be medically necessary and provided by, or coordinated
with, a primary care provider, except for behavioral health and children's
preventive dental services. Services must be rendered by providers that are
appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their scope of practice,
and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall provide the same
standard of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

KIDSCARE COVERED SERVICES: Effective 10/1/01: KidsCare members are eligible for
the same services covered for members under the Title XIX program.

AMBULATORY SURGERY AND ANESTHESIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a free-standing surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

AUDIOLOGY: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 2l including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through other than medical or surgical means
(i.e. hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due to
an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 2, Behavioral Health Services.

CHILDREN'S REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-22, Article 2
A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3. Eligibility criteria and the referral
process are described in the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual available in the
Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall monitor referrals to CRS to ensure CRS covered services are
provided in a timely manner to eligible members. Referral to CRS does not
relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for providing medically necessary
services not covered by CRS to CRS eligible members. The Contractor is also
responsible for initial care of newborn members, who are CRS eligible. The
Contractor must require the member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) to coordinate
their care with the CRS program. All services provided must be included in the
member's medical record maintained by the PCP.

The Contractor is not responsible for payment of those CRS covered services for
which a CRS eligible member refuses to receive through the CRS program. A member
with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS. If the member uses their
private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, and the member is not
enrolled with CRS, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable deductibles
and copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered
services to its members. If the Contractor becomes aware that CRS has failed to
meet the established appointment standards, or has failed to provide medically
necessary CRS covered services, the Contractor shall immediately notify AHCCCSA,
Office of Medical Management, of the occurrence. In accordance with AHCCCS
policy, the Contractor may seek reimbursement from CRS for providing CRS covered
services.

CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved by the
Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition. Medicare
approved


                                       13
<PAGE>

chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to limitations specified in
CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if prescribed by the member's
PCP and approved by the Contractor.

DENTAL. The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services, dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the AHCCCS periodicity
schedule, therapeutic dental services, dentures, and pre-transplantation dental
services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance with the EPSDT periodicity
schedule for dental screening services and ensure that dental service reports
are included in the member's medical record maintained by the PCP. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Standards. The Contractor
shall ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the
member has not been scheduled for a visit. If no dental screening is received by
the member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of 21 may
request dental services without referral and may choose a dental provider from
the Contractor's provider network. For members who are 21 years of age and
older, the Contractor shall provide emergency dental care, medically necessary
dentures and dental services for transplantation services as specified in the
AMPM. Dental standards may be found in the AMPM, Section 310, which is
incorporated herein by reference and which may be found in the Bidder's Library.

DIALYSIS: The Contractor shall provide medically necessary dialysis, supplies,
diagnostic testing and medication for all members when provided by
Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-certified end stage renal disease
(ESRD) providers. Services may be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an
inpatient basis if the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic
dialysis services.

EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT (EPSDT): The Contractor
shall provide comprehensive health care services through primary prevention,
early intervention, diagnosis and medically necessary treatment to correct or
ameliorate defects and physical or mental illness discovered by the screenings
for members under age 21. The Contractor shall ensure that these members receive
required health screenings, including developmental/behavioral health, in
compliance with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule (Exhibit 430-1 in the AMPM) and
to submit to the AHCCCS Office of Medical Management; all EPSDT reports as
required by AHCCCS medical policy. The Contractor is required to meet specific
participation/utilization rates for members as described in Section D, Paragraph
16, Performance Standards. Because behavioral health benefits for Title XIX and
Title XXI members are provided through the ADHS/RBHA system, the Contractor
shall ensure the initiation and coordination of the referral of these members to
the RBHA and shall follow up with the RBHA to monitor whether members have
received behavioral health services

EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the following as a
minimum:

a.       Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by qualified medical
         professionals to provide pre-hospital, emergency care on a
         24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the sudden onset of a medically
         emergent condition as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-10l and R9-31-101.
         Emergency medical services are covered without prior authorization. The
         Contractor is encouraged to contract with emergency service facilities
         for the provision of emergency services. The Contractor is encouraged
         to contract with or employ the services of non-emergency facilities
         (e.g. urgent care centers) to address member non-emergency care issues
         occurring after regular office hours or on weekends. The Contractor
         shall be responsible for educating members and providers regarding
         appropriate utilization of emergency room services including behavioral
         health emergencies. The Contractor shall monitor emergency service
         utilization (by both provider and member) and shall have guidelines for
         implementing corrective action for inappropriate utilization. For
         utilization review, the test for appropriateness of the request for
         emergency services shall be whether a prudent layperson, similarly
         situated, would have requested such services. For purposes of this
         contract, a "prudent layperson" is a person who possesses an average
         knowledge of health and medicine.

b.       All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency condition

c.       Emergency transportation

d.       Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse, physician
         assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent or urgent

e.       The Contractor shall comply with guidelines regarding the coordination
         of post-stabilization care.

prevent pregnancy. These include medical, surgical, pharmacological and
laboratory services, as well as contraceptive devices. Information and
counseling necessary to allow the members to make informed decisions regarding
family planning methods shall also be included. If the Contractor does not
provide family planning services, it must contract for these services through
another health care delivery system, which allows members freedom of choice in
selecting a provider. A prospective offeror may discuss arrangements for family
planning services only with other prospective offerors during the RFP process
for the purpose of making arrangements for the provision of family planning
services.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family Planning
Services Extension Program; a program that provides only family planning
services for a maximum of 24 months to women whose SOBRA eligibility has
terminated. The Contractor is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a
SOBRA woman is sterilized to prevent inappropriate enrollment in the SOBRA
Family Planning Services Extension Program. Notification may be made at the time
the newborn is reported or after the sterilization procedure is completed.

HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND SCREENING: The Contractor shall provide these
services for non-hospitalized members 21 years of age and older. These services
include, but are not limited to, screening for hypertension, elevated
cholesterol, colon cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and
HIV/AIDS; nutritional assessment in cases when the member has a chronic
debilitating disease affected by nutritional needs; mammograms and prostate
screenings; physical examinations and diagnostic work-ups; and immunizations.
Required assessment and screening services for members under age 21 are included
in the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule.

members who do not require hospital care. This service is provided under the
direction of a physician to prevent re-hospitalization or institutionalization
and may include nursing, therapies, supplies and home health aide services.

HOSPICE: These services are covered for members under 21 years of age who are
certified by a physician as being terminally ill and having six months or less

laboratory, radiology, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, blood and blood
derivatives, etc. are also covered. Outpatient services include any of the above
services, which may be provided on an outpatient or ambulatory basis (i.e.

or treat medical conditions of a significant degree of instability and/or
disability.

services provided to members. The Contractor is responsible for reimbursement to
IHS or tribal facilities for emergency services provided to Title XXI Native
American members enrolled with the Contractor. AHCCCSA will reimburse claims on
a FFS basis to providers for acute care services that are medically necessary
and eligible for 100% Federal reimbursement, and that are provided to Title XIX
members in an IHS or a 638 tribal facility.

from a licensed midwife must also be assigned to a PCP for other health care and
medical services. The Contractor shall allow women and their newborns to receive
up to 48 hours of inpatient hospital care after a routine vaginal delivery and
up to 96 hours of inpatient care after a cesarean delivery. The attending health
care provider, in consultation with the mother, may discharge the mother or

granted an extended stay in the hospital of birth when the mother's continued
stay in the hospital is beyond the 48 or 96 hour stay.

The Contractor shall inform all assigned AHCCCS pregnant women of voluntary
prenatal HIV testing and the availability of medical counseling if the test is

danger of death unless the pregnancy is terminated. In addition, providers must
submit to the Contractor a Certificate of Medical Necessity for Pregnancy
Termination. Prior authorization is required. If the procedure is performed on
an emergency basis, documentation, outlined in the AMPM, is required for a
member under eighteen years of age or a member who is considered an
incapacitated adult who seeks a medically necessary pregnancy termination, as
defined above.

MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME), ORTHOTIC AND PROSTHETIC
DEVICES: These services are covered when prescribed by the member's PCP,
attending physician or practitioner, or by a dentist. Medical equipment may be
rented or purchased only if other sources are not available which provide the
items at no cost. The total cost of the rental must not exceed the purchase
price of the item. Reasonable repairs or adjustments of purchased equipment are
covered to make the equipment serviceable and/or when the repair cost is less
than renting or purchasing another unit.

NURSING FACILITY. The Contractor shall provide nursing facility services,
including religious nonmedical health care institutions, for members who require
short-term convalescent care not to exceed 90 days per contract year. In lieu of
a nursing facility, the member may be placed in an assisted living facility or

<PAGE>

ALTCS Program Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of nursing
facility coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility
coverage during the time the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing
facility services covered by a third party insurer (including Medicare) while

limitation. See Paragraph 36, Nursing Facility Reimbursement, for further
details.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for 75
days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the stay
goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner selected by, or assigned
to, the member. The PCP provides primary health care and serves as a gatekeeper
and coordinator in referring the member for specialty medical services,

the member's primary medical record, which contains documentation of all health
risk assessments and health care services of which they are aware whether or not
they were provided by the PCP.

RADIOLOGY AND MEDICAL IMAGING: These services are covered when ordered by the
member's PCP, attending physician or dentist and are provided for diagnosis,
prevention, treatment or assessment of a medical condition. Services are
generally provided in hospitals, clinics, physician offices and other health
care facilities.

REHABILITATION THERAPY: The Contractor shall provide occupational, physical and
speech therapies. Therapies must be prescribed by the member's PCP or attending
physician for an acute condition and the member must have the potential for
improvement due to the rehabilitation. Occupational and speech therapies are
only covered on an inpatient basis for those members who are 21 and over;
physical therapy for all members and occupational and speech therapies for
members under the age of 21 are covered on both an inpatient and outpatient
basis if not used as a maintenance regimen.

RESPIRATORY THERAPY: This therapy is covered on an inpatient or outpatient basis
when prescribed by the member's PCP or attending physician and is necessary to
restore, maintain or improve respiratory functioning.

TRANSPLANTATION OF ORGANS AND TISSUE, AND RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT DRUGS: These
services are covered within limitations defined in the AMPM for members
diagnosed with specified medical conditions. Such limitations include whether
the stage of the disease is such that the transplant can affect the outcome; the
member has no other conditions that substantially reduce the potential for
successful transplantation; and whether the member will be able to comply with
necessary and required regimens of treatment. Bone grafts are also covered under
this service. Services include pre-transplant inpatient or outpatient
evaluation; donor search; organ/tissue harvesting or procurement; preparation
and transplantation services; and convalescent care. In addition, if a member
receives a transplant covered by a source other than AHCCCS, medically necessary
non-experimental services are provided within limitations after the discharge
from the acute care hospitalization for the transplantation. AHCCCS has
contracted with transplantation providers for the Contractor's use or the
Contractor may select its


                                       17
<PAGE>

own transplantation provider. However, the quality of services must be equal to
or exceed those of the AHCCCS provider and the rate paid can not exceed the
AHCCCS provider's negotiated rate.

AHCCCSA is in the process of releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the
purpose of contracting with an entity that will coordinate transplant services
for all AHCCCS members. It is anticipated that the responsibility for transplant
services will be transferred to the new contractor on January 1, 2002.

TRANSPORTATION: These services include emergency and non-emergency medically
necessary transportation. Emergency transportation, including transportation
initiated by an emergency response system such as 911, may be provided by
ground, air or water ambulance to manage an AHCCCS member's emergency medical
condition at an emergency scene and transport the member to the nearest
appropriate medical facility. Non-emergency transportation shall be provided for
members who are unable to provide their own transportation for medically
necessary services.

TRIAGE/SCREENING AND EVALUATION: These are covered services when provided by
acute care hospitals, IHS facilities and urgent care centers to determine
whether or not an emergency exists, assess the severity of the member's medical
condition and determine services necessary to alleviate or stabilize the
emergent condition. The provider must notify the Contractor within 12 hours of
the member's registration with the facility for emergency services. Supporting
documentation for services rendered must be provided when reporting or billing a
service. Triage/screening services must be reasonable, cost effective and meet
the criteria for seventy of illness and intensity of service.

members to the RBHA when determined necessary through the screening process.

The Contractor is responsible for RBHA referral and follow-up collaboration, as
necessary, for other Title XIX and Title XXI members identified as needing
behavioral health evaluation and treatment. Members may also access the RBHA
system for evaluation by self-referral or be referred by schools, State agencies
or other service providers. The Contractor is responsible for providing
transportation to a member's first RBHA evaluation appointment if a member is
unable to provide their own transportation.

EMERGENCY SERVICES: For Title XIX and Title XXI members not enrolled with ADHS,
the Contractor is responsible for up to three days of inpatient behavioral

room settings to help stabilize the member or determine the need for inpatient
behavioral health services. ADHS is responsible for medically necessary
psychiatric consultations provided to Title XIX and Title XXI ADHS enrolled
members in emergency room settings.

COORDINATION OF CARE: The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical
record is established by the PCP when behavioral health information is received
from the RBHA or provider about an assigned member even if the PCP has not yet
seen the assigned member. In lieu of actually establishing a medical record,
such information may be kept in an appropriately labeled file but must be
associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is established. The
Contractor shall require the PCP to respond to RBHA/provider information
requests pertaining to ADHS enrolled members including, but not limited to,
current diagnosis, medication, pertinent laboratory results, last PCP visit, and
last hospitalization. For prior period coverage, the Contractor is responsible
for payment of all claims for medically necessary covered behavioral health
services to members not enrolled with ADHS.

MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES: The Contractor shall allow PCPs to provide
medication management services (prescriptions, medication monitoring visits,
laboratory and other diagnostic tests necessary for diagnosis and treatment of
behavioral disorders) to members with diagnoses of depression, anxiety and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The Contractor shall make available,
on the Contractor's formulary, medications for the treatment of these disorders.

The Contractor shall ensure that training and education is available to PCPs
regarding behavioral health referral and consultation procedures. The Contractor

the availability of resource information through the Maricopa Integrated Health
System's Psychiatric Residency Training Program and the Arizona Medical
Association regarding the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health
disorders.

The Contractor shall ensure that its quality management program incorporates
monitoring of the PCP's management of behavioral health disorders.

3.       AHCCCS MEDICAL POLICY MANUAL

The AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM) is hereby incorporated by reference into
this contract. The Contractor is responsible for complying with the requirements
set forth within. The AMPM with search capability and linkages to AHCCCS rules,
Statutes and other resources is available to all interested parties through the
AHCCCS Home Page on the Internet (www.ahcccs.state.az.us). Upon adoption by
AHCCCSA, AMPM updates will be available through the Internet at the beginning of
each month. If required, the Contractors may receive one hard copy of the AMPM,
free of charge, from AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, however, the
Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining such copies current with these
updates.

4.       VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of the Social
Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program which became
effective 10/1/94. Through this program, the federal and state governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. Therefore, the Contractor shall


                                       19
<PAGE>

not utilize AHCCCS funding to purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19.
Any provider, licensed by the State to administer immunizations, may register
with ADHS as a "VFC provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall
comply with all VFC requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if
providing immunizations to AHCCCS members under the age of 19, the providers are
registered with ADHS/VFC.

5.       DENIALS OR REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES

When any covered service subject to prior authorization is denied, reduced,
suspended or terminated, the Contractor shall comply with the notice, request
for hearing and continuation of benefit requirements specified in 42 CFR ss.
431.200, et seq., A.A.C. R9-22-Article 13 and R9-3 1-Article 13, and the AHCCCS
Member Rights and Responsibilities Policy. This information must be explained in
the Member handbook provided for each member by the Contractor. The Contractor
is required to promptly provide any services specified in the AHCCCS Director's
decisions, irrespective of whether or not a Petition for Rehearing is filed.
Also, refer to Attachment H, Grievance and Request for Hearing Process and
Standards.

6.       ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll members. The
Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any reason unless directed to do
so by AHCCCSA. Eligibility for the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined
by one of the following agencies:

<TABLE>
<S>                                          <C>
Social Security Administration (SSA)         SSA determines eligibility for the Supplementary Security Income (SSI) cash
                                             program. SSI cash recipients are automatically eligible for AHCCCS
                                             coverage.

Department of Economic Security (DES)        DES determines eligibility for the families with children, pregnant women
                                             and children under SOBRA, under section 1931 of the Social Security Act,
                                             the Adoption Subsidy Program, Title IV-E foster care children, Young Adult
                                             Transition Insurance Program, the Federal Emergency Services program
                                             (FES), and effective 10/1/200 1, the Title XIX Waiver Members.

AHCCCSA                                      AHCCCSA determines eligibility for the SSI/MAO groups, including the
                                             FES program for this population (aged, disabled, blind), the Arizona Long-
                                             Term Care System (ALTCS), the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program
                                             and other Medicare cost sharing programs, and the Title XXI program,
                                             KidsCare.

Arizona's 15 Counties                        Proposition 204 legislation permits DES to allow counties to continue to
                                             perform eligibility determinations for AHCCCS until October 1, 2002.
</TABLE>

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9-22, Article 17.

HEALTH PLAN CHOICE

Title XIX members, including Title XIX waiver members, have a choice of
available health plans. A listing of the available health plans and their
telephone numbers will be given to each applicant during the application process
for AHCCCS benefits. Also included are instructions to applicants to call the
health plans directly with specific questions concerning the health plan. If
there is only one health plan available for the applicant's Geographical Service
Area, no choice is offered. Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA's being
notified of their eligibility are automatically assigned to a health plan based
on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm.

Title XXI members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned. When a member is transferred from
Title XIX to Title XXI and has not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the
member will remain with the Title XIX health plan and a choice notice will be
sent to the member. The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from
the date the choice notice is sent.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX members include:
previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90 days will
be automatically enrolled with the same contractor, if that contractor is still
available. Also, women who are eligible for the Family Planning Services
Extension Program will automatically remain assigned to the


                                       20
<PAGE>

same health plan. The Family Planning Services Extension Program provides a
maximum of 24 months of family planning services.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX member with the Contractor
will generally be the day prior to the date the Contractor receives notification
from AHCCCSA via the daily roster. However, the Contractor is responsible for
payment of medically necessary covered services retroactive to the member's
beginning date of eligibility.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member will be the first day of
the month following notification to the health plan. If a Title XXI member is
determined eligible by the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled with
the health plan as of the 1st of the following month. If the member is
determined eligible AFTER the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled
with the health plan as of the 1st of the second following month.

</TABLE>

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for Title XIX
members. Prior period coverage starts from the first day of the month of
application, or first eligible month, whichever is later, to the day a member is
enrolled with the Contractor. For MED's, prior period coverage is the time
period from the date the member met spenddown to the date of eligibility
approval. The Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically
necessary covered services provided to members during prior period coverage.
This may include services provided prior to the contract year (See Section D,
Paragraph 37, Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement
from AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

NEWBORNS: Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers, including Title XXI mothers,
who were enrolled at the time of the child's birth, and whose newborn
notification was received by AHCCCSA, will be enrolled with the mother's health
plan. The Contractor is responsible for noticing AHCCCSA of a child's birth to
an enrolled member. Capitation to the Contractor will begin on the date
notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of births during prior
period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the newborn's
date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered services to the
newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification of the child's birth.
Note that AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification calls 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. Eligible mothers of newborns are sent a letter advising
them of their right to choose a different contractor for their child; otherwise
the child will remain with the mother's contractor. Newborns of FES mothers are
auto-assigned to a health plan and mothers of these newborns are sent a letter
advising them of their right to choose a different health plan for their child.
In the event the FES mother chooses a different health plan, AHCCCS will recoup
all capitation paid to the originally assigned plan and the baby will be
enrolled retroactive to the date of birth in the second plan. The second plan
will receive prior period capitation from the date of birth to the day before
assignment and prospective capitation from the date of assignment forward. The
second contractor will be responsible for all covered services to the newborn
from date of birth.

ENROLLMENT GUARANTEES: Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible
member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of five full months of continuous
enrollment. Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member,
the


                                       21
<PAGE>

member is guaranteed a minimum of 12 full months of continuous enrollment.
Enrollment guarantees do not apply to Native Americans who choose to obtain
their covered services through Indian Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service
basis or children enrolled with Department of Economic Security/Comprehensive
Medical and Dental Program. The enrollment guarantee applies a maximum of one
time per member per eligibility category for Title XIX and Title XXI members. If
a member changes from one contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee
period, the remainder of the guarantee period applies to the new contractor. The
enrollment guarantee may not be granted or may be terminated if the member is
incarcerated or, if a minor child is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22, Article 17 and
R9-31, Article 3 describes other reasons for which the enrollment guarantee may
not apply.

NATIVE AMERICANS: Native Americans, on or off-reservation, have a choice to
receive services from Indian Health Services (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility
or any available contractor. If choice is not available or made within the
specified time limit, Native American Title XIX members living on-reservation
will be assigned to IHS. Native American Title XIX members living
off-reservation will be assigned to an available contractor using AHCCCSA's
family continuity policy and auto-assignment algorithm. Native Americans may
change from IHS to a contractor or from a contractor to IHS at any time. Native
American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being determined
eligible.

7.       MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, genetic information, or physical or mental
handicap, except where medically indicated. Contractors must take into account a
member's culture, when addressing members and their concerns, and must take
reasonable steps to encourage subcontractors to do the same. The Contractor must
make interpreters available for members to ensure appropriate delivery of
covered services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
         available facility.

b.       Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is
         provided in a different manner or at a different time from that
         provided to other members, other public or private patients or the
         public at large except where medically necessary.

c.       Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
         related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in
         any way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed
         by others receiving any covered service.

d.       The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the
         basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin,
         ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS
         membership, or physical or mental handicap of the participants to be
         served.

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the
intent of allowing or permitting the subcontractor to implement barriers to care
(i.e. the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of its contract.

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination by one of its
providers, it shall promptly intervene and implement a corrective action plan.
Failure to take prompt corrective measures may place the Contractor in default
of its contract.

8.       MEMBER INFORMATION

All informational materials prepared by the Contractor shall be approved by
AHCCCSA prior to distribution to members. The reading level and name of the
evaluation methodology used should be included.

- All materials shall be translated when the Contractor is aware that a language
is spoken by 3,000 or 10% (whichever is less) of the Contractor's members who
also have Limited English Proficiency (LEP) in that language.

- All vital materials shall be translated when the Contractor is aware that a
language is spoken by 1,000 or 5% (whichever is less) of the Contractor's
members who also have LEP in that language. Vital materials must include, at a
minimum, notices for denials, reductions, suspensions or terminations of
services, vital information from the member handbooks and consent forms.


                                       22
<PAGE>

- All written notices informing members of their right to interpretation and
translation services in a language shall be translated when the Contractor is
aware that 1,000 or 5% (whichever is less) of the Contractor's members speak
that language and have LEP.

When there are program or service site changes, notification shall be provided
to the affected members at least 14 days before implementation. The Contractor
shall review and update the Member Handbook at least once a year. The Handbook
must be submitted to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care for approval by Sept. 1 of
each contract year, or within four weeks of receiving the annual renewal
amendment, whichever is later.

The Contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all information prepared
for distribution to members is written at a 4th grade level.

The Contractor shall produce and provide the following printed information to
each member or family within 10 days of receipt of notification of the
enrollment date:

I.       A Member Handbook which, at a minimum, shall include the following
         items that are also listed in the Office of Managed Care, Operations
         Policy #404, Member Information Policy:

         a.       A table of contents.

         b.       A general description of how managed care works, particularly
                  in regards to member responsibilities, appropriate utilization
                  of services and the PCP's role as gatekeeper of services.

         c.       A description of all available covered services and an
                  explanation of any service limitations or exclusions from
                  coverage and a notice stating that the Contractor will be
                  liable only for those services authorized by the Contractor.
                  The description should include a brief explanation of the

A.       If you have a question or problem, please call _________ and ask to
         talk to a Member Representative. They are there to help you.

A.       If you have a specific complaint about your medical care, the Member
         Representative will help you.

Q.       What if I'm not happy with the help given to me by the Member
         Representative?

A.       If you are unhappy with the answer you receive, you can tell the Member
         Representative you want to file a written or oral grievance. The
         grievance must be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the
         action, decision, or incident.

A.       [Contractor's name] will make a final decision for grievances within 30
         days of receiving your written or oral grievance. A letter will be
         mailed to you stating the health plan's decision and the reason for the
         decision. The letter will tell you how you can appeal the decision if
         you are still unhappy. You must let the health plan know you want to
         appeal the decision letter.

A.       If you are appealing the health plan's decision, [Contractor's name]

         will then decide if the health plan's decision was correct under the
         circumstances.

9.       MEMBER SURVEYS

AHCCCSA may periodically conduct a survey of a representative sample of the
Contractor's membership. AHCCCSA will design a questionnaire to assess
accessibility, availability and continuity of care with PCPs; communication
between members and the Contractor; and general member satisfaction with the
AHCCCS program. To ensure comparability of results, the questions to the members
will be the same for all contractors. AHCCCSA will consider suggestions from the
Contractor for questions to be included in each survey. The results of these
surveys will become public information and available to all interested parties
upon request. In addition, unless waived by AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall
perform its own annual general or focused member survey. All such contractor
surveys must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.

11.      ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE

AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual
anniversary date. AHCCCSA may hold an open enrollment on a limited basis as
deemed necessary. During AEC, members may change contractors subject to the
availability of other contractors within their Geographic Service Area. Members
are mailed a printed enrollment form and may choose a new contractor by
contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process. If the member does not
participate in the AEC, no change of contractor will be made (except for
approved changes under the Change of Plan Policy) during the new anniversary
year. This holds true if the Contractor's contract is renewed and the member
continues to live in the Contractor's service area. The Contractor shall comply
with the Office of Managed Care Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice
and Other Plan Changes policy.

12.      TRANSITION OF MEMBERS

The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM, and the Office of Managed Care Member
Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice and Other Plan Changes standards for
member transitions between health plans or GSAs, to or from an ALTCS program
contractor, IHS, a PL 93-638 tribal entity, and upon termination or expiration
of a contract. The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and

         relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification of the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible to coordinate care with
the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and for
providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions of how to obtain services.

In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is terminated for any reason,
or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the transition of its members
to other contractors, and shall abide by standards and protocols set forth
above. In addition, AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the
contract on a month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of members. The
Contractor shall make provision for continuing all management and administrative
services until the transition of all members is completed and all other
requirements of this contract are satisfied. The Contractor shall be responsible
for providing all reports set forth in this contract and necessary for the
transition process and shall be responsible for the following:

         amounts;

         the prior month.

<PAGE>

h.       In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCSA,
         such termination or suspension shall not affect the obligation of the
         Contractor to indemnify AHCCCSA for any claim by any third party
         against the State or AHCCCSA arising from the Contractor's performance
         of this contract and for which the Contractor would otherwise be liable
         under this contract.

i.       Any dispute by the Contractor with respect to termination or suspension
         of this contract by AHCCCSA shall be exclusively governed by the
         provisions of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

         (1)      Maintaining written policies that address the rights of adult
                  members to make decisions about medical care, including the
                  right to accept or refuse medical care, and the right to
                  execute an advance directive. If the agency/organization has a
                  conscientious objection to carrying out an advance directive,
                  it must be explained in policies. (A health care provider is

                  decision to execute or not execute an advance directive, and
                  not making it a condition for the provision of care.

                  directives including notification of direct care providers of

16.      PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

All Performance Standards described below apply to Title XIX, Title XXI, and
state-only member populations. Effective October 1, 2001, AHCCCS requires
Contractors to implement the Quality Improvement System for Managed Care
(QISMC). AHCCCS will work with the Contractors to develop quality improvement
projects that will meet the QISMC guidelines. Compliance with this requirement
is a part of the Operational and Financial Review.

Contractors must meet AHCCCS stated Minimum Performance Standards. However, it
is equally important that Contractors continually improve their performance
indicator outcomes from year to year, as defined by QISMC. Contractors shall
strive to meet the ultimate standard, or Benchmark, established by AHCCCS.

Any statistically significant drop in the Contractor's performance level for any
indicator must be explained by the Contractor in its annual quality management
program evaluation. If a Contractor has a significant drop in any indicator
without a justifiable explanation, it will be required to submit a corrective
action plan and may be subject to sanctions.


                                       27
<PAGE>

AHCCCS has established three levels of performance:

-        MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD -- A Minimum Performance Standard is the
         minimally expected level of performance by the Contractor. If a
         Contractor does not achieve this standard for two consecutive years,
         the Contractor will be required to submit a corrective action plan and
         may be subject to sanctions. If the rate for any indicator declines to
         a level below the AHCCCS Minimum Performance, the Contractor will be
         required to submit a corrective action plan and may be subject to
         sanctions.

-        GOAL -- A Goal is a reachable standard for a given performance
         indicator for the Contract Year. If the Contractor has already met or
         exceeded the AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standard for any indicator, the
         Contractor must strive to meet the CYE 2002 Goal for the indicator(s).

-        BENCHMARK -- A Benchmark is the ultimate standard to be achieved.
         Contractors that have already achieved or exceeded the Goal for any
         performance indicator must strive to meet the Benchmark for the
         indicator(s). Contractors that have achieved the Benchmark are expected
         to maintain this level of performance for future years.

A Contractor that has not shown demonstrable and sustained improvement toward
meeting AHCCCS Performance Standards shall develop a corrective action plan. The
corrective action plan must be received by the Office of Medical Management
within 30 days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS. This plan must be
approved by AHCCCS prior to implementation. AHCCCS may conduct one or more
follow-up onsite reviews to verify compliance with a corrective action plan.
Failure to achieve adequate improvement may result in sanction imposed by
AHCCCS.

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS: For CYE 2001, the Contractor shall comply with AHCCCS
quality management requirements to improve performance for all AHCCCS
established performance indicators. Complete descriptions of these indicators
can be found in the Technical Specifications section of the most recently
published Health Plan Performance Standards Results and Analysis documents for
perinatal, pediatric and adult/adolescent services. For CYE 2002, the indicator
for postpartum visits has been eliminated as a contractual performance standard.
The Contractor shall continue to monitor rates for postpartum visits and
implement interventions as necessary to improve or sustain its rates. This
activity will be monitored by AHCCCS during the annual Operational and Financial
Review.

In addition, AHCCCS has established standards for the following indicators:

EPSDT PARTICIPATION: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program. The participant rate is the number of
children younger than 21 years receiving at least one medical screen during the
contract year, compared to the number of children expected to receive at least
one medical screen. The number of children expected to receive at least one
medical screen is based on the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule and the average
period of eligibility.

PEDIATRIC IMMUNIZATIONS: The Contractor shall ensure members under age 21
receive age-appropriate immunizations as specified in the AMPM

The Contractor shall participate in an annual immunization audit based on random
sampling to assess and verify the immunization status of two-year-old members.
AHCCCS will provide the Contractor the selected sample, specifications for
conducting the audit, the AHCCCSA reporting requirements, and technical
assistance. The Contractor shall identify each child's PCP, conduct the
assessment, and report to AHCCCS in the required format all immunization data
for the two-year-old children sampled. If medical records are missing for more
that 5 percent of the sample group, the Contractor is subject to sanctions by
AHCCCSA. An External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) may conduct a study to
validate the Contractor's reported rates.

                                       32
<PAGE>
assignment, should the member desire to do so. The Contractor shall confirm any
PCP change in writing to the member. Members may make both their initial PCP
selection and any subsequent PCP changes either verbally or in writing.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a.       Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member
b.       Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care
c.       Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member
d.       Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
         services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
         referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided to
assigned members by specialty physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational
audits. PCPs and specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's
members shall have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one
general acute care hospital that is located within the Contractor's service
area.

23.      OTHER PROVIDER STANDARDS

The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to:

a.       Recruit sufficient specialty physicians, dentists, health care
         professionals, health care institutions and support services to meet
         the medical needs of its members.
b.       Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider
         network to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of
         care to members with limited proficiency in English.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

For specialty services, the Contractor shall ensure that:

a.       PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except
         that women shall have direct access to GYN providers without a referral
         for preventive and routine services. Any waiver of this requirement by
         the Contractor must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA.
b.       Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a
         medical condition other than that for which the member was referred,
         unless approved by the member's PCP.
c.       The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP complete
         documentation of all diagnostic services including copies: of test
         results; if applicable; treatment services provided; and the resulting
         outcome for each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The Contractor
may include in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.       Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians who are
         general practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics
b.       Certified nurse midwives
c.       Licensed midwives.

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric care (physician
or certified nurse midwife). Such assignment shall be consistent with the
freedom of choice requirements for selecting health care professionals while
ensuring that the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a
PCP for medical care as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges. Licensed midwives perform deliveries only in the member's
home. Labor and delivery services may also be provided in the member's home by
physicians, certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.

24.      NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of
location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient personnel for the
provision of covered services, including emergency medical care on a
24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall be sufficient to
provide covered services within designated time and distance limits. For
Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that 95% of its
members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson do
not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP or pharmacy. 95% of its
members residing outside the boundary area must not have to travel more than 10
miles to see such providers. See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for
details on network requirements by Geographic Service Area. Also see Section D,
Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for details on changes
in hospital subcontracting effective October 1, 2001.

Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall not discriminate
with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program, reimbursement or
indemnification against any provider based solely on the provider's type of
licensure or certification. This provision, however, does not prohibit the
Contractor from limiting provider participation to the extent necessary to meet
the needs of the Contractor's members. This provision also does not interfere
with measures established by the Contractor to control costs consistent with its
responsibilities under this contract.

25.      NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertain to all
service specifications described in the AMPM, Chapters 300, 600 and 900. In
addition, the Contractor shall have policies on how the Contractor will:

a.       Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or program
         changes and requirements
b.       Monitor and control network compliance with policies and rules of
         AHCCCSA and the Contractor, including compliance with all policies and
         procedures related to the grievance process and ensuring the member's
         care is not compromised during the grievance process.
c.       Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network
d.       Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
         network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service
         area
e.       Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient providers
         to handle the volume of members
f.       Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring appointment
         procedures standards, appointment waiting times, and service provision
         standards

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one,
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract. The
Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned material changes in the
provider network before the change process has begun, for example before issuing
a 60-day termination notice to a provider. The notification shall be made within
one working day if the change is unexpected. AHCCCSA will assess proposed
changes in the Contractor's provider network for potential impact on members'
health care and provide a written response to the Contractor within 14 days of
receipt of request. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining the
quality of member care if the provider network change is likely to result in
deficient delivery of covered services.

26.      FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the federal mandates. Under the Benefits Improvement and
Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA). AHCCCSA is required to reimburse FQHCs the
difference between the Contractor's reimbursement to the FQHC, and what the FQHC
would have received under the Medicaid Prospective Payment System (PPS). This
requirement replaces the supplemental payment methodology that began October 1,
1997. AHCCCSA and its contractors are required to comply with this legislation.


                                       34
<PAGE>

AHCCCSA and the FQHCs have agreed that AHCCCSA will reimburse the FQHCs $1.75
per member per month for Title XIX members only. This payment methodology was
implemented effective January 1, 2001. To comply with BIPA requirements, AHCCCSA
will establish a baseline rate. After a baseline rate is established, AHCCCSA
will adjust the payment rate annually in accordance with annual inflation
trends.

Contractors are required to submit member month information for Title XIX
members, including Title XIX Waiver members, for each FQHC on a quarterly basis
to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care. AHCCCSA will perform periodic audits of the
member month information submitted. Contractors should refer to the Office of
Managed Care's policy on FQHC reimbursement for further guidance. The following
FQHCs are currently recognized by CMS:

                  Canyonlands Community Health Care
                  Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc.
                  Clinica Adelante, Inc.
                  Desert Senita Community Health Center
                  El Rio Health Center
                  Inter-Tribal Health Care Center
                  Marana Health Center
                  Mariposa Community Health Center, Inc.
                  Mountain Park Health Center
                  Native American Community Health Center, Inc.
                  Native Americans for Community Action Family Health Center
                  North Country Community Health Center
                  Sun Life Family Health
                  Center Sunset Community Health Center (formerly Valley Health
                  Center, Inc.)
                  United Community Health Center, Inc.

Any other clinics that subsequently become FQHC's will be subject to the
reimbursement methodology described above.

27.      PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number. A
Provider Participation Agreement must be signed by each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

28.      PROVIDER AFFILIATION TRANSMISSION

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Transmission User Manual on October 15, January 15, April
15, and July 15 of each contract year. The Manual may be found in the Bidder's
Library.

29.      PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its CMS grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor. The
submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute
failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

         a.       Timeliness:       Reports or other required data shall be
                  received on or before scheduled due dates.

         b.       Accuracy:         Reports or other required data shall be
                  prepared in strict conformity with appropriate authoritative
                  sources and/or AHCCCS defined standards.

         c.       Completeness:     All required information shall be fully
                  disclosed in a manner that is both responsive and pertinent to
                  report intent with no material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.


                                       35
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag time in filing
source documents by subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library. The required reports, which are subject to change during the contract
term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report Requirements.

30.      DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA or the federal government to its members. The
cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All advertisements,
publications and printed materials that are produced by the Contractor and refer
to covered services shall state that such services are funded under contract
with AHCCCSA.

31.      REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as requested no
later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified
in the request itself.

32.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business. The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess
new contractors' readiness and ability to provide contract services to members
at the start of the contract year and current contractors' readiness to expand
to new geographic service areas. A new contractor will be permitted to commence
operations only if the Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's
satisfaction.

33.      OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with CMS requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular Operational
and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not limited to) ensuring
operational and financial program compliance. The Reviews will identify areas
where improvements can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and provide the
Contractor with technical assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply
with all other medical audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and
R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by
AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel, as identified in advance shall
be available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site review
activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at the
discretion of AHCCCSA if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from NCQA,
JCAHO or any other nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must
submit the entire accreditation report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and Financial Review
Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior to
AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review findings
may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP requirements must be implemented by the
Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to
determine the Contractor's progress in


                                       36
<PAGE>

implementing recommendations and achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews
may be conducted at any time after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

34.      CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with ARS 36-2904(H)
and (K), AHCCCS Rules R9-22-705, and R9-22-709, a copy of which may be found in
the Bidder's Library. In the absence of a subcontract provision to the contrary,
claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from the date of service or the
effective date of eligibility posting, whichever is later. Remittance advices
accompanying the Contractor's payments to providers must contain, at a minimum,
adequate descriptions of all denials and adjustments, the reasons for such
denials and adjustments, the amount billed, the amount paid, and grievance and
request for hearing rights. The Contractor's claims payment system, as well as
its prior authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize the
likelihood of having to recoup already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess of
$50,000 per provider within a contract year must be approved in advance by
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, unless a subcontract
specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall ensure that 90% of all clean claims
are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid within 90
days of receipt of the clean claim.

During the term of this contract, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring all health plans
to use a standardized electronic format for electronic claims processing between
the plan and its providers. AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the
Technical Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by CMS FFS providers and their billing agents who submit claims
electronically to AHCCCS. The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts will be supplemented
by a Form C layout. All formats are subject to changes as required by federal
law. Reasonable implementation timeframes will be negotiated with each plan.

35.      HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTIES ONLY: Legislation authorizes the Hospital
Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective from October 1, 2001,
through September 30, 2003. The Pilot as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-718
requires hospital subcontracts to be negotiated between health plans in Maricopa
and Pima counties and hospitals to establish reimbursement levels, terms and
conditions. Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor and hospitals to
cover operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims submission and payment,
payment of discounts or penalties, legal resolution, which may, as an option,
include establishing arbitration procedures. These negotiated subcontracts shall
remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to ensure availability of quality
services within specific service districts, equity of related party interests,
reasonableness of rates. The general provisions of this program encompass acute
care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that result in an
admission. The Contractor shall submit all hospital subcontracts and any
amendments to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, for prior approval. For
non-emergency patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that at least 65% of its
members use contracted hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently
adjust the 65% standard. Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgement the number of
emergency days at a particular non-contracted hospital becomes significant,
AHCCCSA may require a subcontract at that hospital.

ALL COUNTIES EXCEPT MARICOPA AND PIMA: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals
for member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain contracts with hospitals in all GSA's and must submit
copies of these contracts, including amendments, to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, at least seven days prior to the effective dates thereof.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical reviews of all
hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously paid claims are subject to
recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack of medical necessity
through concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review, lack of medical
necessity identified during postpayment medical review shall not constitute a
basis for recoupment by the Contractor. This prohibition does not apply to
recoupments that are a result of an AHCCCS reinsurance audit. See also Section
D, Paragraph 34, Claims Payment System. For a more complete description of the
guidelines for hospital reimbursement, please consult the Bidder's Library for
applicable statutes and rules.


                                       37
<PAGE>

FOR OUT-OF-STATE HOSPITALS: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state
hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

36.      NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility
described above applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. To further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member
could be ALTCS eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that
occurs on the same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment. The Contractor is
responsible for payment of services while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor. The Contractor is not responsible for the full 90 days per contract
year of nursing facility coverage if ALTCS enrollment occurs before the 90 days
has ended.

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in a
nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under this contract. If
the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program
Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days per contract year of nursing
facility coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for nursing facility
coverage during the time the member is enrolled with the Contractor. Nursing
facility services covered by a third party insurer (including Medicare) while
the member is enrolled with the Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day per
contract year limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day per contract year maximum.

37.      COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, delivery supplement, hospitalized
supplement for Title XIX Waiver members, HIV-AIDS supplement, reinsurance (PPC
and prospective), and third party liability, as described and defined within
this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
contract. Payment must comply with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36. AHCCCSA
reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the
Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer nor indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, and as
otherwise specified in this section, any savings remaining to the Contractor as
a result of favorable claims experience and efficiencies in service delivery at
the end of the contract term may be kept by the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be separately
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System
Fund. An error discovered by the State with or without an audit in the amount of
fees paid to Contractor will be subject to adjustment or repayment by Contractor
making a corresponding decrease m a current Contractor's payment or by making an
additional payment by AHCCCSA to the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the Contractor. Ths
section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from making payment to a
fiscal agent hired by Contractor.


                                       38
<PAGE>

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required copayment from
members but service will not be denied for inability to pay the copayment.
Except for permitted copayments, the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not
bill or attempt to collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services. Any required copayments collected shall belong to the
Contractor or its subcontractors.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE (PPC) CAPITATION: The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all PPC member months., including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members
during prior period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation
described below. Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of
members who were enrolled at the time of delivery.

RECONCILIATION OF PPC COSTS TO REIMBURSEMENT: For CYE `02 and `03, a full
reconciliation to 0% profit or loss will be done by AHCCCSA for all eligibility
groups, except for the Title XIX Waiver Group. Only the retro period is eligible
for this reconciliation. AHCCCSA will reimburse the health plans 100% of any
excess reasonable costs as determined by reported encounters, and all profits
will be recouped. Refer to the Office of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation
Policy for further details of the reconciliation process.

RISK SHARING FOR TITLE XIX WAIVER MEMBERS: For CYE' 02 and CYE' 03, AHCCCSA will
reconcile the contractor's PPC and prospective medical cost expenses (net of
reinsurance, excluding administrative and non-operating expenses) to PPC
capitation, prospective capitation, and hospitalized supplements (net of
administration) paid to the Contractor during the year. This reconciliation will
limit the Contractor's losses to 2% and profits to 4%. Any losses in excess of
2% will be reimbursed to the Contractor, and likewise, profits in excess of 4%
will be recouped. Encounter data will be used to determine medical expenses.

The Contractor may choose to elect an alternative risk sharing methodology on
October 1, 2001 for CYE `02. In this alternative risk sharing methodology,
AHCCCSA will recoup profits in excess of 1% and reimburse losses in excess of
1%. Refer to the Title XIX Waiver Reconciliation Policy for details of the
reconciliation process.

DELIVERY SUPPLEMENT: When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home.

HIV-AIDS SUPPLEMENT: On a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA shall utilize encounters to
determine the number of members receiving approved HIV/AIDS drugs and calculate
the amount of the supplemental payment. The rate of reimbursement for this
separate per member per month payment is specified in Section B and is subject
to review during the term of the contract. AHCCCSA reserves the right to recoup
any amounts paid for ineligible members as determined through an encounter data
review as well as an associated penalty for incorrect encounter reporting.

Refer to the Office of Managed Care's HIV/AIDS supplemental payment and review
policies for further details and requirements.

38.      CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

INCENTIVE FUND: AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of capitation
reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors based on their performance
measure outcomes. AHCCCSA will notify Contractors 60 days prior to a new
contract year if this methodology will be implemented and will provide details
of the reimbursement methodology at that time.

CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS: Except for changes made specifically in accordance with
this contract, the rates set forth in Section B shall not be subject to
re-negotiation or modification during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its
option, review the effect of a program change and determine if a capitation
adjustment is needed. In these instances the adjustment will be prospective with
assumptions discussed with the Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates.
The Contractor may request a review of a program change if it believes the
program change was not equitable; AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a
review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the


                                       39
<PAGE>

default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from
future monthly capitation for any portion of a month during which the Contractor
was not at risk due to, for example:

a.       death of a member
b.       member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date
         of incarceration)
c.       duplicate capitation to the same contractor
d.       adjustment based on change in member's contract type

If a member is enrolled twice with the same contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39.      REINSURANCE

REGULAR ACUTE PROSPECTIVE REINSURANCE: Reinsurance is a stop-loss program
provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for the partial reimbursement of covered
inpatient facility medical services incurred for a member with an acute medical
condition beyond an annual deductible (AHCCCS Rule R9-22-503 and R9-31-503). Per
diem rates paid for nursing facility services, including room and board,
provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall
be eligible for reinsurance coverage. Refer to the AHCCCS Re insurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

AHCCCSA is self-insured for the reinsurance program. The program is
characterized by an initial deductible level and a subsequent coinsurance
percentage. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which AHCCCSA will reimburse
the Contractor for inpatient covered services incurred above the deductible.
Prospective reinsurance coverage applies to prospective enrollment periods. The
deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS acute care
enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services) as of
October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown in the
following table. These deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during
the term of this contract. Any change would have a corresponding impact on
capitation rates.

</TABLE>

A Contractor whose enrollment qualifies for the $35,000 or $50,000 deductible
level may, prior to the start of the contract period, elect one of the lower
deductible levels indicated in the above table. Contractors may riot elect to
increase their deductible level. If a Contractor's actual deductible is $35,000
or $50,000, AHCCCSA will increase the Contractor's capitation rate awarded by
defined amounts for each capitation risk group. These specific capitation
adjustments are available from the Office of Managed Care.

PRIOR PERIOD COVERAGE REINSURANCE: A separate reinsurance deductible and
coinsurance percentage will apply during prior period coverage. As noted in the
table above, all Contractors, regardless of enrollment, will be subject to a
$5,000 deductible level. The coinsurance percentage for the prior period
coverage reinsurance is 100%. Expenses incurred during prior period coverage
will not apply toward the prospective reinsurance thresholds. Effective October
1, 2001, the Title XIX Waiver Group will no longer be eligible for prior period
coverage reinsurance.

AHCCCSA will use inpatient encounter data to determine prospective and prior
period coverage reinsurance benefits. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month. AHCCCSA will also provide
for a reconciliation of reinsurance payments in the case where encounters used
in the calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted or voided.

Effective October 1, 1998, when a member changes Contractors within a contract
year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs incurred for that
member will follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all
submitted encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of
service within the current contract year) will be applied


                                       40
<PAGE>

toward the receiving health plan's deductible level. For further details
regarding this policy and other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS
Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

Medical review on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance cases will
be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random sampling.
AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, will generate the sampling and will
notify the Contractor of documentation needed for the retrospective medical
review process to occur at the Contractor's offices. Reinsurance consideration
will be given to inpatient facility contracts, and hearing decisions rendered by
the Office of Legal Assistance. Pre-hearing and/or hearing penalties
discoverable during the review process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance.
A recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor will occur
based on the results of the medical review sampling. The results of the medical
review sampling will be separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and
prior period coverage reinsurance reimbursement populations in the review time
frame for the Contractor. AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days
advance notice of any on-site review. The Contractor shall have all requested
medical records on-site. Any documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall
be made available upon request of the Review Team during the course of the
review. The Contractor representative shall be available to the Review Team at
all times during AHCCCSA on-site review activities. While on-site, the
Contractor shall provide the Review Team with workspace, access to a telephone,
electrical outlets and privacy for conferences. The Contractor will be furnished
a copy of the Reinsurance Review Report within 60 days of the onsite review and
given an opportunity to comment on any review findings.

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE: The reinsurance program also includes a special
Catastrophic Reinsurance program. This program encompasses members diagnosed
with hemophilia, von Willebrand's Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. This program
also covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and tissue
transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver, kidney,
and other organ transplantation. For additional detail and restrictions refer to
the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There are no
deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All catastrophic claims are
subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, Reinsurance
Unit, of cases identified for catastrophic non-transplant reinsurance coverage
within 30 days of (a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and
(c) the beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid
for a maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to
AHCCCSA.

HEMOPHILIA: When a member is identified as being catastrophically eligible by
AHCCCSA due to the specific diagnosis of hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1,
286.2), all medically necessary covered services provided during the contract
year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all
members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders and
dependent on Plasma Factor VIII. The Contractor must promptly notify AHCCCS
Office of Medical Management Reinsurance Unit after diagnosis. All medically
necessary covered services provided during the contract year shall be eligible
for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy. All medically necessary covered services provided during
the contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's
paid amount.

TRANSPLANTS: Bone grafts and cornea transplantation services are not eligible
for catastrophic reinsurance coverage but are eligible under the regular
(non-catastrophic) reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM, Chapter 300 for
covered services for organ and tissue transplants. Catastrophic reinsurance
coverage for transplants is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount,
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library. When a member is referred to a transplant facility for an
AHCCCS-covered organ transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of
Medical Management.

Encounter data will not be used to determine catastrophic reinsurance benefits
for transplants. However, this does not relieve the Contractor of the
responsibility for submitting encounters for all catastrophic reinsurance
services.

Effective October 1, 2000, Contractors will be reimbursed 100% for medically
necessary expenses provided in a contract year, after a catastrophic reinsurance
case reaches $650,000. This additional reimbursement will limit a Contractor's
medical expenses to $97,500 per catastrophic reinsurance case.


                                       41
<PAGE>

All reinsurance claims must be submitted within fifteen months after the date of
service, or date of eligibility posting, whichever is later.

40.      COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used as
a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are
cost avoidance and postpayment recovery. The Contractor shall use these methods
as described in A.A.C. R9-22-10. See Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare Services
and Cost Sharing.

COST AVOIDANCE: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i.e. other insurer) will provide the service. However, if a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making
these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the Contractor's
network. The Contractor's liability for coinsurance and deductibles is limited
to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service pursuant to a
written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service rate, less any
amount paid by the third party. (The Contractor must decide whether it is more
cost-effective to provide the service within its network or pay coinsurance and
deductibles for a service outside its network. For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its network.) If the
Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer (other than
Medicare), and the insurer requires payment in advance of all copayments,
coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so. (See also Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
prenatal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party ("pay and chase"). In emergencies, the Contractor
shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the
third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically necessary
transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits. Further, if a
service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that its cost
avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service and that
the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for use
of the other insurer's providers.

POSTPAYMENT RECOVERIES: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The Contractor shall identify
all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except
in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue reimbursement in the
following circumstances unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by
AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA'S authorized representative:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                   <C>
Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance             Restitution Recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance             Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors, including casualty                       Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery
</TABLE>

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002 and R9-3l-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts. In
joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to the
referral of any and all relevant case information to AHCCCSA's authorized
representative by the Contractor. AHCCCSA's authorized representative is also
responsible for negotiating and acting in the best interest of all parties to
obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases and may compromise a settlement in
order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal and other costs. For total
plan cases involving only payments from the Contractor, the Contractor is
responsible for performing all research, investigation, the filing of liens and
payment of lien filing fees and other related costs. The Contractor shall use
the cover sheet as prescribed by AHCCCS when filing liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

                                       42
<PAGE>

a.       Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
         Contractor's financial liability for the member
b.       There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service,
         reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing, etc.)
c.       Such recovery is not prohibited by state or federal law

REPORTING. The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. In addition, upon AHCCCSA's request, the

Contractor shall provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including
open and closed cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the
member's first and last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount;
paid/recovered amount; and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide
the format and reporting schedule for this information to the Contractor. The
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working
days of the identification of a third-party liability case with retnsurance.
Failure to report reinsurance cases may result in one of the remedies specified
in Paragraph 60 (Sanctions) of Section D. The Contractor shall communicate any
known change in health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the
date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the
Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a complete
file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for the
purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA
of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by
AHCCCSA.

TITLE XXI (KIDSCARE): Eligibility for KidsCare benefits requires that the
applicant/member not be enrolled with or entitled to any other health insurance
benefits. If the Contractor becomes aware of any such potential coverage, the
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately. The Contractor shall follow the
same cost avoidance and postpayment recovery practices for the KidsCare
population as it does for the Title XIX population, and shall maintain a
reporting system which allows Title XIX and KidsCare information to be reported
separately.

CONTRACT TERMINATION: Upon termination of this contract, the Contractor will
complete the existing third party liability cases or make any necessary
arrangements to transfer the cases to AHCCCSA's authorized TPL representative.

41.      MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligible". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. The Contractor is responsible for adhering to the cost sharing
responsibilities presented in the AHCCCS Medicare Cost Sharing policy. Effective
10/1/97, the Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare
payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same service of a
non-Medicare member.

42.      COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-711 and R9-31-711. The Contractor may not
collect copayments for family planning and EPSDT services.

43.      RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services and
expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS Rules
and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial statements,
records relating to the quality of care, medical records, prescription files and
other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all reasonable times
during the term of this contract and the period set forth in paragraphs a. and
b. below any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction by any
authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or Federal government.


                                       43
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract except as provided
in paragraphs a. and b. below:

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to
the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for a period of five
years from the date of any such termination. Records which relate to grievances,
disputes, litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the performance
of this contract, or costs and expenses of this contract to which exception has
been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for a period of five
years after the date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44.      MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who generates the
record. Each member is entitled to one copy of his or her medical record free of
charge. The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to maintain
the confidentiality of all medical records. AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to
all members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20 working days
of receipt of request.
The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical record is established
when information is received about a member. If the PCP has not yet seen the
member, such information may be kept temporarily in an appropriately labeled
file, in lieu of actually establishing a medical record, but must be associated
with the member's medical record as soon as one is established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the maintenance of
medical records so that those records are documented accurately and in a timely
manner, are readily accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on the medical
record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training and evaluating
providers' compliance with the Contractor's medical records standards. Medical
records shall be maintained in a detailed and comprehensive manner which
conforms to good professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates an adequate
system for follow-up treatment. Medical records must be legible, signed and
dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies of medical
records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10 working days from receipt of
the request for transfer of the medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member before
requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any other agency. The
Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's medical records without written
approval of the member if the reason for such request is directly related to the
administration of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as protected
HIV-related information is not disclosed. (A.R.S. ss. 36-6641)

45.      ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not, without
similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any
entity, including another fund or line of business within its organization. All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities or
Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA pnor approval. (See the Reporting
Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the prior approval of
individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to
the Office of Managed Care.

46.      ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSA's as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.


                                       44
<PAGE>

47.      DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines which is available in the Bidder's Library. The information
so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all procedures,
policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of this contract. If any
of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter
changed both parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due to
any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required by
AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security
code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies that
any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the submitted
input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for
any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion, or erroneous
input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
describes the specific technical and procedural requirements for interfaces
between AHCCCS and the Contractor and its subcontractors. The Contractor is
responsible for complying with all technical requirements as stated in this
manual as well as any subsequent changes to the manual. A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the health
plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA): The Contractor
shall comply with the Administrative Simplification requirements of Subpart F of
the HIPPA of 1996 (Public Law 107-191, 110 Statutes 1936) and all federal
regulations implementing that Subpart that are applicable to the operations of
the Contractor by the dates required by the implementing federal regulations.
Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph constitute grounds for
the termination of this contract.

CONTRACT TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HIPAA: The Contractor shall
notify AHCCCS no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to any
required compliance date if the Contractor is unwilling to or anticipates that
it will be unable to comply with any of the requirements of the preceding
paragraph. Receipt by AHCCCS of a notice of anticipated inability of
unwillingness to comply as required by this paragraph constitute grounds for the
termination of this contract.

48.      ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of
the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits, set
fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share payments
to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance standards. The
Contractor shalt submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered services for
which the Contractor incurred a financial liability, including services provided
during prior period coverage. This requirement is a condition of the CMS grant
award.


                                       45
<PAGE>

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats. Formatting and specific
requirements for encounter data are described in the AHCCCS Encounter Reporting
User Manual and the AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines, copies of which may
be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission Requirements are
included herein as Attachment I.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available to
AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim to an
adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found in The Encounter
User's Manual.

49.      MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and changes to
members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the Contractor
shall use to update its member records. The daily roster which is run prior to
the monthly roster is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate
code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end of every month.
The roster will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of
the first day of the next month. This roster contains the information used by
AHCCCSA to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month. The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly roster.
After reconciling the monthly roster information, the Contractor resumes posting
daily roster updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in that they pay
and/or recoup capitation into the next month.

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface Guidelines
available in the Bidder's Library for additional information.

50.      TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through 9/30/98. In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the sole option to extend the term of the contract. Legislation
was passed that allows AHCCCSA the right to extend the contract in excess of
five years. As a result of this legislation, AHCCCSA is exercising it's right to
extend the contract to 9/30/03. The new contract cycle will be effective
10/01/03. All contract extensions shall be through contract amendment. If, in
conjunction with a contract extension, AHCCCSA elects to increase the capitation
rate for any new category, such increase will not exceed in aggregate the
inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another. Further,
AHCCCSA may require a contractor to renew all GSA's, or may terminate remaining
GSA's if the Contractor does not agree to renew all GSA's.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the provisions of such
extension will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing
by AHCCCSA, even if the extension amendment has not been signed by the
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing
that it refuses to sign the extension amendment. If the Contractor provides such
notification, AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

CONTRACTOR'S NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO RENEW: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the Contractor
provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at
least 180 days before its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be
waived by AHCCCSA.

51.      SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor


                                       46
<PAGE>

conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such conditions, any
function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to this contract may
be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All such subcontracts
must be in writing. See policy on claims processing by subcontracted providers
in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing, and shall incorporate by
reference the terms and conditions of this contract. The following subcontracts
shall be submitted to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30
days prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.       Automated data processing
b.       Third-party administrators
c.       Management Services (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)
d.       Model subcontracts
e.       Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
         subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts,
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is violable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA. All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of Federal and State laws,
regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider the
Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing services on its behalf more
than 25 times during the contract year. Exceptions to this requirement include
the following:

a.       If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the
         contract year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the
         Contractor, the Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal
         to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt
         to gain such agreement.
b.       If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room
         physician or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the
provisions of Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In addition, each
subcontract must contain the following:

a.       Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
         consideration to be received by the subcontractor.
b.       Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.
c.       Identification of the population, to include patient capacity, to be
         covered by the subcontractor.
d.       The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be provided, and
         for which compensation will be paid.
e.       The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending dates,
         methods of extension, termination and renegotiation.
f.       The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of
         benefits and determination of third-party liability.
g.       A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and
         other third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or third
         party liability payment before submitting claims to the Contractor.
h.       A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
         keeping system.
i.       Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
         assurance programs and comply with the utilization control and review
         procedures specified in 42 CFR Part 456, as implemented by AHCCCSA.
j.       A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in
         ownership of a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the
         Contractor shall require a contract amendment and prior approval of
         AHCCCSA.
k.       Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population
         (may also refer to the Provider Manual).
1.       A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all
         tax obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other
         applicable insurance coverage obligations which arise under this
         subcontract, for itself and its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have
         no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
         coverage.

52.      SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over and supersede existing and future subcontracts for services
that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider waiving this
requirement in particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement exceed that
payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make direct
payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor. Adjudication of
claims related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall remain
the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may provide technical assistance
prior to the implementation of any specialty contracts.

AHCCCSA shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor
prior to the implementation of any specialty contract.

53.      MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA Contracting Office as described in
Section D, Paragraph 51, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must be submitted
with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or corporate
allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are determined to
be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment to the
Contractor, the Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or
financial sanctions may be imposed.

54.      MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end.

If services billed by a consultant or actuary are less than $50,000, AHCCCSA
will waive the requirement for an audit of that consultant or actuary.

55.      MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement for
both new and continuing offerors must be met within 15 days after contract
award.


                                       48

                  GSA #18    Cochise, Santa Cruz             1,450,000
</TABLE>

NEW OFFERORS: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSA's, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSA's awarded. This requirement is in addition to
the Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57 below and must
be met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirements may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

CONTINUING OFFERORS: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA that
they are currently servicing must meet the equity per member standard (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) for their current
membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must fund
through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet this requirement.
Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional
capitalization for the new GSA they are bidding. (See the table of requirements
by GSA above). Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their
existing membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $5,000,000 in equity.

56.      PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surely company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA
for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations to
providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance by
the Contractor of its obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond
shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS Performance
Bond policy available in the Office of Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a.       Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers
         and nonproviders by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations
         under this contract,
b.       Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
         Contractor, and
c.       Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses
         incurred by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
         this contract, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after
         termination of this Contract for reasons other than the convenience of
         the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is solely
responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of substitute
security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its
permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall provide
AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor may not change
the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without prior written
approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.


                                       49
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or create other
creditors using the bond as security.

57.      AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid in the month of October 1997, or as
determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include SOBRA
supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied by the Contractor not
later than 15 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the amount required.
Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics of the Contractor
on a monthly basis. If there is an increase in capitation payment that exceeds
10% of the performance bond amount, AHCCCSA may require an increase in the
amount of the Performance Bond. The Contractor shall have 15 days following
notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The
Performance Bond amount that must be maintained after the contract term shall be
sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by
AHCCCSA. The Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond
without prior written approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

58.      FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS/PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability standards/performance
guidelines. On a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA will review the following ratios with
the purpose of monitoring the financial health of the Contractor. The two
Financial Viability Standards, the Current Ratio and Equity per Member, are the
standards that best represent the financial solvency of the Contractor.
Therefore, the Contractor must comply with these two financial viability
standards.

AHCCCSA will also monitor the Medical Expense Ratio, the Administrative Cost
Percentage, and the RBUC's Days Outstanding. These guidelines are analyzed as
part of AHCCCSA's due diligence in financial statement monitoring. Sanctions
will not be imposed if the Contractor does not meet these performance
guidelines. However, if a critical combination of the Financial Viability
Standards and Performance Guidelines are not met, additional monitoring, such as
monthly reporting, may be required.

FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS:

CURRENT RATIO                       Current assets* divided by current
                                    liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
                                    long-term investments that can be converted
                                    to cash within 24 hours without significant
                                    penalty (i.e., greater than 20%). Standard:
                                    At least 1.00

                                    *if current assets includes a receivable
                                    from a parent company, the parent company
                                    must have liquid assets that support the
                                    amount of the intercompany loan.

EQUITY PER MEMBER                   Equity*, less on-balance sheet performance
                                    bond, divided by the number of non- SOBRA
                                    Family Planning Extension Services members
                                    enrolled at the end of the period. Standard.
                                    At least $150 (Failure to meet this standard
                                    may result in an enrollment cap being
                                    imposed in any or all contracted GSAs.)

                                    *for purposes of this measurement, the
                                    equity to be measured must be supported by
                                    unencumbered current assets.

PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES:

MEDICAL EXPENSE RATIO               Total medical expenses (net of reinsurance,
                                    TPL, HIV/AIDS Supplement) divided by total
                                    capitation + Delivery Supplement. Standard:
                                    At least 85%

ADMINISTRATIVE COST PERCENTAGE      Total administrative expenses (excluding
                                    income taxes), divided by total capitation +
                                    Delivery Supplement + TPL + reinsurance +
                                    HIV/AIDS Supplement. Standard:      No more
                                    than 10%


                                       50
<PAGE>

59.      MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract
amendment. The Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization and/or
transition plan to AHCCCSA Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review. The purpose of
the plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new
entity's ability to support the provider network, ensure that services to
members are not diminished and that major components of the organization and
AHCCCS programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or
change in ownership.

60.      SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may impose sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or terminate this
contract or any related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-606
and the terms of this contract and applicable federal or State law and
regulations. Written notice will be provided to the Contractor specifying the
sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction and either the length of
suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be withheld. The Contractor
may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in accordance with AHCCCS Rule
R9-22-804.

In lieu of the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose partial or
full enrollment caps on the Contractor. Among the contract violations that may
result in an enrollment cap are, but are not limited to, the following:

a.       Marketing violations
b.       Failure to meet AHCCCS Financial Viability Standards
c.       Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network
d.       Quality of care and quality management issues
e.       Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards

CURE NOTICE PROCESS: Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements. If, at the end of the specified time period, the
Contractor has complied with the cure notice requirements, AHCCCSA will take no
further action. If, however, the Contractor has not complied with the cure
notice requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of sanctions.

61.      AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not exercise their right to choose and don't have family
continuity, are assigned to Contractors through an auto-assignment algorithm.
The algorithm is a mathematical formula used to distribute members to the
various Contractors in a manner that is predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA
goals. The algorithm favors those Contractors with lower capitation rates. For
further details on the AHCCCS Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G.
AHCCCSA may change the algorithm at any time during the term of the contract and
frequently does so in response to Contractor-specific issues of non-compliance
(e.g. imposition of an enrollment cap). The Contractor should consider this in
preparing its response to this RFP. AHCCCSA is not obligated to adjust for any
financial impacts this may have on the Contractor.

62.      GRIEVANCE AND REQUEST FOR HEARING PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance and request for hearing
process for members and providers which defines and explains their rights
regarding any adverse action by the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide the
appropriate personnel to establish, implement and maintain the necessary
functions related to grievances, requests for hearing, and denials and
reductions of services. Refer to Attachment H for Grievance and Request for
Hearing Process and Standards and Paragraph 5, Denials and Reductions of
Services.

The grievance and request for hearing process shall be in accordance with
applicable federal and state laws, AHCCCS rules and policies, including, but not
limited to R9-22-Article 8, R9-31-Article 8 and the Members Rights and
Responsibilities Policy. The Contractor must ensure that the Contractor's
grievance and request for hearing policies include processing procedures and
documentation requirements. The Contractor must ensure that it provides written
information to both members and providers which clearly explains the grievance
and request for hearing process.


                                       51
<PAGE>

The Contractor shall be responsible to provide the necessary professional,
paraprofessional, and clerical services for the representation of the Contractor
in all issues relating to grievances, denials and reductions of services and any
other matters arising under this contract which rise to the level of
administrative hearing or a judicial proceeding.

63.      QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly Grievance Report Format on file in the
Bidder's Library. The Quarterly Grievance Report must be received by the
AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance, no later than 45 days from the end of the
quarter.

64.      KIDSCARE

On November 1, 1998, AHCCCSA implemented a Title XXI Children's Health Insurance
Program, referred to as "KidsCare". KidsCare provides health care coverage
statewide to eligible children under age 19 and is provided through the existing
AHCCCS health plans, state employee HMOs that elect to participate at the
beginning of a contract cycle, and tribal facilities or Indian Health Service
for Native Americans who elect to receive services through them.

The KidsCare service package is established by the legislature and approved by
CMS through the State Plan. Capitation rates payable to the Contractor for
KidsCare members will be set by AHCCCSA in conjunction with an independent
actuary.

KidsCare members in families with gross household income over 150% and up to
200% of the federal poverty limit shall pay a premium to AHCCCSA. The premium
amount shall be based on the number of members in the household and the gross
family income in accordance with 9 A.A.C., Article 14.

TITLE XVI PARENT/GUARDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: A.R.S. ss.36-2984 mandates
that the Contractor offer health insurance coverage to the parent(s) or legal
guardian(s) of a child who is eligible for Title XXI. The Contractor shall
establish rates for this coverage, which must be approved by AHCCCSA, Office of
Managed Care, prior to implementation. Title XXI funds or any other federal or
state funds shall not be used to subsidize family coverage. The full cost of the
premium shall be paid by the parent or legal guardian who elects this coverage.
The Contractor may include provisions for pre-existing conditions and any other
medical underwriting considerations that are necessary to protect it from
adverse risk. For further information, refer to the Title XXI Parent/Guardian
Health Insurance Coverage Guidelines on file in the Bidder's Library.

65.      PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

In addition to the requirements described in this RFP, there are several
legislative issues that will have an impact on services provided by the
Contractor on or after October 1, 2001. The following is a brief summary of the
issues.:

BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER: Legislation was passed to adopt a federal program
that expands Title XIX eligibility to women under the age of 65 who are between
100% and 250% of FPL that have been diagnosed with either breast or cervical
cancer. This program will be implemented early in 2002.

TICKET TO WORK: Legislation was passed to adopt a federal program that expands
Title XIX eligibility to individuals, 16 through 64 years old who meet SSI
eligibility criteria, and whose earned income is at or below 250% FPL. This
program will be implemented early in 2002.

AHCCCS COVERAGE FOR THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR KIDSCARE: During the
2001 legislative session, AHCCCS is required to apply for an 1115 Waiver to
cover the parents of children eligible for KidsCare up to 200% of FPL. AHCCCS
will need state match if the waiver is approved, and will seek legislative
expenditure authority. It is anticipated that this program will be effective
October 1, 2002.

In addition to the above pending legislative issues, the final regulations for
the Budget Balanced Act of 1997 have not been finalized. Contractors shall
comply with the BBA regulations upon finalization.

66.      SEPARATE INCORPORATION

As specified in A.R.S. ss. 36-2906.01, within 60 days of contract award, a
non-governmental Contractor shall have established a separate corporation for
the purposes of this contract, whose sole activity is the performance of
contract function with


                                       52
<PAGE>

AHCCCS.


67.      CULTURAL COMPETENCY

The Contractor shall have a Cultural Competency Plan that meets the requirements
of the AHCCCS Cultural Competency Policy. The Contractor must identify a staff
member responsible for the cultural competency plan and inform the office of
Managed Care of that person's identity.

68.      MEDICAID IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Department of Education, and
a contract with a Third Party Administrator, AHCCCS began paying participating
school districts for specifically identified Medicaid services when provided to
Medicaid-eligible children who are included under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Medicaid services must be identified in
the member's Individual Education Plan (IEP) as medically necessary for the
child to obtain a public school education. In the first phase of the Medicaid in
the Public Schools (MIPS) program, AHCCCS began reimbursement to school
districts for services provided beginning July 1, 2000. These services included
speech, physical and occupational therapies, nursing services, attendant care
(health aid services provided in the classroom), transportation to and from
school on days when the child receives an AHCCCS-covered MIPS service, and
behavioral health services.

Services provided through MIPS are specifically intended to allow children to
attend school and do not replace medically necessary services provided outside
the educational setting. Thus, the Contractor's determination of whether
services are medically necessary and should be provided to a child shall be made
independently of whether that child also is receiving MIPS services. If a
request is made for services that also are covered under the MIPS program for a
child enrolled with the Contractor, the request shall be evaluated on the same
basis as any request for a covered service.

20.      CERTIFICATION OF TRUTHFULNESS OF REPRESENTATION

By signing this subcontract, the Contractor certifies that all representations
set forth herein are true to the best of its knowledge.

21.      CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE - ANTI-KICKBACK AND LABORATORY TESTING

By signing this subcontract, the Contractor certifies that it has not engaged in
any violation of the Medicare Anti-Kickback statute (42 USC ss.ss. 1320a-76) or
the "Stark I" and "Stark II" laws governing related-entity referrals (PL 101-239
and PL 101-432) and compensation therefrom. If the Contractor provides
laboratory testing, it certifies that it has complied with 42 CFR ss. 411.361
and has sent to AHCCCSA simultaneous copies of the information required by that
rule to be sent to the Health Care Financing Administration.

22.      CONFLICT IN INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS

In the event of any conflict in interpretation between provisions of this
subcontract and the AHCCCS Minimum Subcontract Provisions, the latter shall take
precedence.

23.      ENCOUNTER DATA REQUIREMENT

If the Contractor does not bill the prime contractor (e.g., Contractor is

24.      CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENT (CLIA) OF 1988

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) of 1988 requires

CLIA Waiver or CLIA Certificate in order to obtain reimbursement from the
Medicare and Medicaid (AHCCCS) programs. In addition, they must meet all the
requirements of 42 CFR 493, Subpart A.

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical laboratories to
provide verification of CLIA Licensure or Certificate of Waiver during the
provider registration process. Failure to do so shall result in either a
termination of an active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

Pass-through billing or other similar activities with the intent of avoiding the
above requirements are prohibited. Prime contractor may not reimburse providers
who do not comply with the above requirements.

[This provision applies only if the Contractor provides services directly to
AHCCCS members]

The Contractor shall maintain for the duration of this subcontract a policy or
policies of professional liability insurance, comprehensive general liability
insurance and automobile liability insurance. The Contractor agrees that any
insurance protection required by this subcontract, or otherwise obtained by the
Contractor, shall not limit the responsibility of Contractor to indemnify, keep
and save harmless and defend the State and AHCCCSA, their agents, officers and
employees as provided herein. Furthermore, the Contractor shall be fully
responsible for all tax obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all
other applicable insurance coverage, for itself and its employees, and AHCCCSA
shall have no responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
coverage.

26.      FRAUD AND ABUSE

If the Contractor discovers, or is made aware, that an incident of potential
fraud or abuse has occurred, the Contractor shall report the incident to the
prime contractor, who shall proceed in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plans
and Program Contractors Policy for Prevention, Detection and Reporting of Fraud
and Abuse Incidents involving potential member eligibility fraud should be
reported to AHCCCSA, Office of Program Integrity, Member Fraud Unit. All other
incidents of potential fraud should be reported to AHCCCSA, Office of the
Director, Office of Program Integrity. (See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-511.)

                    ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS

                          (By Geographic Service Area)

INSTRUCTIONS:

Contractors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of
meeting contract requirements. The information that follows describes the
minimum network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA). In some GSA's
there are required service sites located outside of the geographical boundary of
a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical access to care. In certain
instances, a member must travel a much greater distance to receive services
within their assigned GSA, if the member were not allowed to receive services in
an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which straddle
two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these zip codes is
based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip code has been assigned by
AHCCCS. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing services to members
residing in the entire zip code that is assigned to the GSA for which the
Contractor has agreed to provide services. The split zip codes GSA assignments
are as follows:

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, and pediatrics) are not
included in the primary care provider contract, at least one subcontract is
required for each of these specialties in the service sites specified. General
surgeons must be available within 50 miles of service sites.

In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Contractor must
demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that
members don't need to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific to
GSA #6.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall have a physician with admitting and treatment
privileges with each hospital in its network. Contractors in GSA 10 and/or GSA
12 must have at least one hospital contract in each service district. This
requirement is part of the Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement Pilot
Program, described more fully in Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital
Reimbursement. A list of Phoenix and Tucson area hospitals are included.

Provider categories required at various service delivery sites included in the
Service Area Minimum Network Standards are indicated as follows:

================================================================================

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who have the right to choose but do not exercise this right, are
assigned to contractors through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a
mathematical formula used to distribute members to the various contractors in a
manner that is predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals.

The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case may be
a member or a household of members) to contractors using the target percentages
developed. The algorithm data table consists of all the zip codes in the state,
all contractors serving each zip code area, and the target percentages by rate
code within each zip code.

The contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a zip code and
rate code, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case for that
zip code. The equation used is:

                  (t/T) - P=d

t= The total members assigned to the zip code per rate code category for the
contractor T=The total members assigned to the zip code per rate code category,
all contractors combined P=The target percentage of members for the rate code
for the contractor d=The difference

The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference for
each contractor. When more than one contractor has the same difference, and
their differences are greater than all other contractors, the contractor with
the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.

All contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each rate
code, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members
accordingly. A contractor with a more favorable target percentage in the
algorithm will receive proportionally more members. Conversely, a contractor
with a lower target percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally
fewer members. The algorithm favors contractors with both lower final bids and
awarded rates. The algorithm also favors those contractors with programs that
score higher based on AHCCCSA's evaluation criteria.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE TARGET PERCENTAGES

For the first year of the contract, the algorithm target percentages will be
developed using the methodology described below. However, for subsequent years,
AHCCCS reserves the right to change the algorithm methodology to assure
assignments are made in the best interest of the AHCCS program and the state.

A contractor's placement in the algorithm is based upon the following three
factors which are weighted equally (i.e., 33.33%):

1.       The final capitation rate bid submitted by the contractor. Final bids
         that are below the bottom of the rate range will be assigned to the
         bottom of the rate range for development of the target percentages.
2.       The contractor's final awarded rate from AHCCCSA.
3.       The contractor's score on the Program component of the proposal.

Points will be assigned to each contractor by rate code by GSA. Based on the
rankings of the final bids submitted and the final awarded rates, each
contractor will be assigned a number of points for each of these two components
separately as follows:

ATTACHMENT I:  ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed for noncompliance with encounter submission
requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter data, such
as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files. Any findings of
incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the imposition of
sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

PENDED ENCOUNTER CORRECTIONS

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days of the
original processing date. Sanctions will be imposed according to the following
schedule for each encounter pended for more than 120 days unless the pend is due
to AHCCCSA error:

<TABLE>

No sanction       $ 5 per month     $ 10 month                $ 15 per month            $20 per month
</TABLE>

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encouter which (1) AHCCCSA acknowledges
to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change to the system
programming, an update to the database reference table, or further research by
AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that the resolution of a pended
encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will respond in
writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The AHCCCSA response
will report the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error, the Contractor
may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the
total number of sanctionable encounters pended more than 120 days.

Pended encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 120 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon request,
make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

ENCOUNTER VALIDATION STUDIES

Per CMS requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of the
Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical
record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter date. Any and
all covered services may be validated as part of these studies. Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.

The following reflects AHCCCA's encounter validation study process and sanction
policy as of 10/1/97. AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and
sanction amounts based on agency review or as a result of consultations with
CMS. The Contractor will be notified in writing of any significant change in
study methodology.

AHCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B" examines
institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the
selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will have
90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records requested
within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record. If
AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from the
Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

================================================================================


The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date that the
encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be received by AHCCCSA no
later than 240 days after the end of the month in which the service was
rendered, or the effective date of enrollment with the Contractor, whichever is
later. For all encounters for which timeliness is evaluated, a sanction per
encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if
the encounter record is received by AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date
determined above. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per
error extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction amounts
may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has changed, or if
CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the
sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the studies begin.

Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate description of
AHCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction per encounter error
extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter is
incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will
be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounter; however,
sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCS determines that encounter quality has
changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor will be
notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time the
studies begin.

Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or historical
files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A" and for Study "B", a
sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
assessed for an omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount will be
$5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "A" and
$10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for Study "B";
however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter
quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The Contractor
will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies at the time
the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the month in
which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's
encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter submissions
for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select a
sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately estimate the
Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by dividing the number
of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed. A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account for limitations caused by sampling. The confidence
interval shows the range within which the true error rate is estimated to be. If
error rates are based on a sample, the error rate used for sanction purposes
will be the lower limit of the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples, which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals, and
sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent to
the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum of 30
days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that
would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to CMS, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA not
more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will be
rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.
Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged. A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be rendered by
AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance and request for hearing pursuant to Article
8 of AHCCCS Rules. Sanction amounts will be deducted from the Contractor's
capitation payment.

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

Contractors are required to submit adjusted or voided encounters in the event
that claims are subsequently adjusted or denied after the initial encounter
submission. This includes adjustments for inaccuracies identified by fraud and
abuse audits or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA or the Contractor.
Contractors shall refer to the Encounter User's Manual for further instructions
regarding adjustments to encounters.

Per Contract YH8-0001, Paragraph 37, Compensation, Risk Sharing for Title XIX
Waiver Members: For CYE '02 and CYE '03, AHCCCSA will reconcile the contractor's
PPC and prospective medical cost expenses to PPC capitation, prospective
capitation, and hospitalized supplements paid to the Contractor during the year.
For CYE '02, the contractor has a choice to elect:



[  ]     Default Method: This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's losses
         to 2% and profits to 4%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed
         to the Contractor, and likewise, profits in excess of 1% will be
         recouped.


[  ]     Alternative Method: This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's
         losses to 1% and profits to 1%. Any losses in excess of 1% will be
         reimbursed to the Contractor, and likewise, profits in excess of 1%
