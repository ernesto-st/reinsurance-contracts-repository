performs claims or other similar services for any other insurer (other than the

immediately prior to the Closing Date, then URC shall automatically adopt those
higher standards in its performance of the Claims Services under this Agreement;
(ii) comply with: (A) all Applicable Laws relating to the Covered Contracts and
to the conduct of the activities contemplated hereby; (B) all reasonable,
written guidelines that the Royal Insurer Affiliates may from time to time

Agreement; (iii) carry on its affairs in the ordinary course of business as was

good faith. URC shall in all respects perform the Claims Services relating to
the Covered Contracts in a manner which would not adversely affect the
reputation of the Royal Insurer Affiliates.

         (b)      For the duration of this Agreement, URC hereby covenants that
it will employ and retain an adequate number of employees with the experience,
skill and expertise to perform the Claims Services URC is obligated to perform
hereunder in a manner consistent with the standards set forth in Section 3.1(a)

         SECTION 4.2 HANDLING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CLAIMS SERVICES. (a) URC shall
initially handle the following claims:

                  (i)      Extra-Contractual Liabilities claims arising under
         any of the Covered Contracts; for the avoidance of any doubt, URC shall
         handle all other aspects of any claims arising under any of the Covered
         Contracts (other than Extra-Contractual Liabilities);

                  (ii)     liability claims over $1 million net;

                  (iii)    property or other claims over $1 million net;

                  (iv)     claims that in URC's best professional judgment have
         the potential to exceed the amounts set forth in (ii) or (iii) above;
         or

                  (v)      claims identified by Royal Insurer Affiliates in
         their sole discretion.

         Provided, however, that any claim involving a matter set forth in
         (i)-(iv) above shall be promptly reported by URC to the Royal Insurer
         Affiliates, with such report to be provided to the Royal Insurer
         Affiliates within three (3) Business Days from the date when URC first
         becomes aware of any such claim. URC shall continue to handle any claim
         involving a matter set forth in (i)-(iv) above, unless and until the
         Royal Insurer Affiliates notify URC that the Royal Insurer Affiliates
         will assume the handling of any such claim, or portion thereof. To the
         extent the Royal Insurer Affiliates determine to exclusively handle any
         such claim, or portion thereof, URC shall promptly forward all
         materials relating to any such claim, or portion thereof, to the Royal
         Insurer Affiliates; provided, however, that, if requested by the Royal
         Insurer Affiliates, URC will fully cooperate and participate in the
         handling of the claims, or any portion thereof, set forth in (i)-(v)
         above. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, to
         the extent a claim set forth in (i)-(iv) above involves both a
         contractual portion and an Extra Contractual Liability portion, and in
         the event the Royal Insurer Affiliates determine that URC should no
         longer handle the underlying contractual portion of such claim, then
         URC, at the direction of the Royal Insurer Affiliates, shall transfer
         the underlying contractual portion of such claim to a third party
         administrator of the Royal Insurer Affiliates' sole choosing; provided,
         however, that such third party administrator shall not be an Affiliate
         of either party. Both URC and the Royal Insurer Affiliates shall be
         equally responsible for paying all expenses incurred by such third
         party administrator in the administration of its duties regarding the
         underlying contractual portion of any such claims.

         (b)      URC shall promptly notify the Royal Insurer Affiliates upon
         URC learning of any claim, arbitration demand or lawsuit filed
         involving an exposure which in URC's best professional judgment could
         have a reasonable potential of becoming an Obligation in Excess of
         Policy Limits.

         (c)      URC shall have no authority to make any payments of any kind
         relating to the Covered Contracts for which there is no reasonable
         basis to conclude that the Royal

                                       12

<PAGE>

         Insurer Affiliates are legally or contractually obligated to make such
         payments under the Covered Contracts.

         (d)      Except as specifically authorized by the Royal Insurer
         Affiliates in writing, URC shall have no authority to enter into any
         agreements or to take other actions on behalf of the Royal Insurer
         Affiliates, to alter, amend any of the Covered Contracts, to modify,
         waive or extend any of their provisions or to represent to third
         parties that it has the authority to do any of the foregoing; provided,
         however, that the parties shall agree to those changes, alterations or
         amendments that are administrative in nature and that URC may
         effectuate without having to obtain any prior authorization from the
         Royal Insurer Affiliates.

         SECTION 4.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH PERFORMANCE
OF CLAIMS SERVICES. The Royal Insurer Affiliates shall have the authority to
impose on URC reasonable procedures, safeguards and guidelines that, in the
reasonable discretion of the Royal Insurer Affiliates, are necessary to avoid,
minimize or address any conflict of interest that may arise in the course of
URC's performance of the Claims Services. In the event any conflict or potential
conflict of interest shall arise in the performance of URC's obligations under

                            FEES FOR CLAIMS SERVICES

         SECTION 5.1 PAYMENT FOR CLAIMS SERVICES Claims Expenses. As detailed
more fully in Exhibit C to this Agreement, the Royal Insurer Affiliates shall,
on the first day of each month of every quarter, reimburse URC for one-third of
the Claims Expenses that URC estimates it will reasonably incur for each quarter
in connection with performance of the Claims Services under this Agreement.
Within fifteen days after each quarter-end, URC shall furnish the Royal Insurer
Affiliates with a statement detailing the Claims Expenses that it incurred for
the quarter just ending. Within fifteen days thereafter, the Royal Insurance
Affiliates shall reimburse URC, or vice versa, as applicable, for any difference
in amount between what the Royal Insurance Affiliates paid URC in total for each
quarter and the total Claims Expenses URC ultimately incurred for that quarter.

         (b)      Projection of Expense. No later than five (5) Business Days
before the beginning of each quarter, URC shall prepare for the approval of the
Royal Insurer Affiliates a projection of the Claims Expenses for the following
quarter. Such projection shall: (i) reflect a fair and reasonable allocation of
URC's services for the Royal Insurer Affiliates; (ii) be done in conformity with
customary insurance accounting practices; and (iii) reflect URC's reasonable
best efforts to contain costs in its provision of Claims Services hereunder.

         (c)      Adjustments of Charges. In the event any party (other than the
Royal Insurer Affiliates) to whom URC provides claims-related services is
charged an amount for any service that is less than the amount the Royal Insurer
Affiliates are being charged under this Agreement for any such or similar
service, then URC, without any action required on the part of the Royal Insurer
Affiliates, shall promptly adjust the rate it charges the Royal Insurer
Affiliates for such service to reflect the rate URC charges the other party.

URC under this Agreement. URC shall reasonably cooperate with, and provide such
auditors and inspectors or any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the
Royal Insurer Affiliates or URC, with any assistance that they reasonably may
require. In performing any such audit, the Royal Insurer Affiliates and its
designated auditors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
disruption to URC's normal business operations.

         (c)      With respect to audits or inspections not involving a
Governmental Entity, the Royal Insurer Affiliates may notify URC of any alleged
deficiencies in its business systems and processes or failure to comply with the

retention only, URC shall retain and store the Books and Records for ten (10)
years after the termination of the Agreement unless the Royal Insurer Affiliates

to URC, all Books and Records, in any form, that are related to the Claims
Services provided by URC under the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that URC shall be permitted to copy or otherwise retain, use and disclose
information set forth in such files and materials to the extent that URC
reasonably requires such information for purposes of its own legitimate business
purposes.

         (g)      To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and at any time as

provide, at reasonable times during normal business hours, full and open access

Affiliates pertaining to the Covered Contracts and the Claims Services to be
provided under this Agreement and to discuss any matters relating to the Covered
Contracts and the Claims Services to be provided under this Agreement with the
employees and agents of the Royal Insurer Affiliates who are familiar therewith,
so that URC shall have sufficient opportunity to make whatever investigation it
shall deem necessary and desirable to effectuate this Agreement, provided,
however, URC shall not have access to the Royal Insurer Affiliate's claim files
on Extra Contractual Liabilities. Such access and opportunity shall be exercised
by URC in a manner that shall not interfere unreasonably with the operations of
the Royal Insurer Affiliates. Such access shall include the right of URC to make
and retain copies of any Books and Records relating to the Covered Contracts to
the extent that URC reasonably determines that it requires copies of any such
Books and Records in order to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for any legitimate business purposes related to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2 or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Section 7.2(f) shall not require that the Royal Insurer
Affiliates provide access or copies to URC of any Books and Records of the Royal
Insurer Affiliates relating to the Covered Contracts the nondisclosure of which
is required by Applicable Law or contractual obligation.

any Books and Records relating to the Covered Contracts, and copies thereof,

         (j)      URC shall be obligated to update all Books and Records, as
well as those that URC produces in the course of providing the Claims Services
under this Agreement, and maintain adequate back-ups relating to all Books and
Records, as well as those that URC produces in the course of providing the
Claims Services under this Agreement, to ensure that all Books and Records, as
well as those that URC produces in the course of providing the Claims Services
under this Agreement, are maintained in accordance with all Applicable Law.

shall be unable to perform any Claims Service for a period that could reasonably
be expected to exceed thirty (30) days or such shorter period as may be required
by Applicable Law or the Covered Contracts, the Royal Insurer Affiliates may
procure such Claims Services for the Covered Contracts by commercially
reasonable means, with the full assistance and cooperation of URC. URC shall be
solely responsible for all costs incurred in restoring Claims Services which
have not been provided due to its failure to adhere to its obligations under
this Agreement; provided, however, that URC shall not pay any of the costs
incurred by the Royal Insurer Affiliates as a result of URC's inability to
perform Claims Services to the extent URC's inability to perform such Claims
Services arises from circumstances or events entirely beyond URC's control;

Insurer Affiliates as a result of URC's inability to perform Claims Services due

under this Agreement for those Claims Services that it is unable to perform and
(ii) the cost to the Royal Insurer Affiliates of procuring such Claims Services
elsewhere.

         (b)      Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.1 to the contrary,
and notwithstanding URC's inability to perform those Claims Services that are
completely and entirely beyond URC's control, to the extent URC is able to
perform Claims Services, or any portion of Claims Services, that is or remains
within URC's control, then URC shall be obligated to perform all such Claims

         SECTION 15.3 ARBITRATION PANEL. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the
members of the Board shall be impartial and disinterested and shall be active or
former executive officers of property-casualty insurance companies, reinsurance
companies or Lloyd's Underwriters or active or inactive lawyers with at least
twenty (20) years of experience in insurance. The Royal Insurer Affiliates and
URC shall each appoint an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators shall choose an
umpire before instituting the hearing. If the respondent fails to appoint its
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after having received claimant's written
request for arbitration, the claimant is authorized to and shall appoint the
second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to agree upon the appointment of
an umpire within thirty (30) days after notification of the appointment of the
second arbitrator, within ten (10) days thereof, the two (2) arbitrators shall
request the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") to appoint an umpire for
the arbitration with the qualifications set forth in this Article. If the AAA
fails to name an umpire, either party may apply to the court named below to
appoint an umpire with the above required qualifications. The umpire shall
promptly notify in writing all parties to the arbitration of his selection and
of the scheduled date for the hearing. Upon resignation or death of any member
of the Board, a replacement shall be appointed in the same fashion as the
resigning or deceased member was appointed.

         SECTION 15.4 SUBMISSION OF BRIEFS. The claimant and respondent shall
each submit initial briefs to the Board outlining the issues in dispute and the
basis, authority and reasons for their respective positions within thirty (30)
days of the date of notice of appointment of the umpire. The claimant and the
respondent may submit reply briefs to the Board within ten (10) days after
filing of the initial brief(s). Initial and reply briefs may be amended by the
submitting party at any time, but not later than ten (10) days prior to the date
of commencement of the arbitration hearing. Reasonable responses shall be
allowed at the arbitration hearing to new material contained in any amendments
filed to the briefs but not previously responded to.

         SECTION 15.5 ARBITRATION BOARD'S DECISION. The Board shall make a
decision and award with regard to the terms of this Agreement and the original
intentions of the parties to the extent reasonably ascertainable. The Board's
decision and award shall be in writing and shall state the factual and legal
basis for the decision and award. The decision and award shall be based upon a
hearing in which evidence shall be allowed and which the formal rules of
evidence

                                       23

<PAGE>

shall not strictly apply but in which cross examination and rebuttal shall be
allowed. At its own election or at the request of the Board, either party may
submit a post-hearing brief for consideration of the Board within twenty (20)
days of the close of the hearing. The Board shall make its decision and award
within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of
post-hearing briefs, whichever is later, unless the parties consent to an
extension. Every decision by the Board shall be by a majority of the members of
the Board and each decision and award by the majority of the members of the
Board shall be final and binding upon all parties to the proceeding.

         SECTION 15.6 JURISDICTION. Either party may apply to any United States
District Court in Delaware or to the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware for
an order compelling arbitration or confirming any decision and the award; a
judgment of that court shall thereupon be entered on any decision or award. If
such an order is issued, the attorneys' fees of the party so applying and court
costs will be paid by the party against whom confirmation is sought. The Board
may award interest calculated from the date the Board determines that any
amounts due the prevailing party should have been paid to the prevailing party.

         SECTION 15.7 EXPENSES. Each party shall bear the expense of the one
arbitrator appointed by it and shall jointly and equally bear with the other
party the expense of any stenographer requested, and of the umpire. Each party
shall bear their own costs for litigation, including, but not limited to,
witness fees, exhibits, depositions, experts, and attorneys fees.

         SECTION 15.8 PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES. Subject to
customary and recognized legal rules of privilege, each party participating in
the arbitration shall have the obligation to produce those documents and as
witnesses to the arbitration those of its employees as any other participating
party reasonably requests providing always that the same witnesses and documents
be obtainable and relevant to the issues before the arbitration and not be
unduly burdensome or excessive. The parties may mutually agree as to pre-hearing
discovery prior to the arbitration hearing and in the absence of agreement, upon
the request of any party, pre-hearing discovery may be conducted as the Board
shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest of fairness, full
disclosure, and a prompt hearing, decision and award by the Board. The Board
shall be the final judge of the procedures of the Board, the conduct of the
arbitration, of the rules of evidence, the rules of privilege and production and
of excessiveness and relevancy of any witnesses and documents upon the petition
of any participating party. To the extent permitted by law, the Board shall have
the authority to issue subpoenas and other orders to enforce their decisions.

         SECTION 15.9 RELIEF AVAILABLE. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent any participating party from applying to any United States District
Court in Delaware or to the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware to issue a
restraining order or other equitable relief to maintain the "status quo" of the
parties participating in the arbitration pending the decision and award by the
Board or to prevent any party from incurring irreparable harm or damage at any
time prior to the decision and award of the Board. The Board shall also have the
authority to issue interim decisions or awards in the interest of fairness, full
disclosure, and a prompt and orderly hearing and decision and award by the
Board.

         SECTION 15.10 CONSOLIDATION. In the event that there is a dispute
between the Royal Insurer Affiliates and URC which implicates the provisions of
this Agreement, the Royal Insurer Affiliates and URC hereby agree to consolidate
any such dispute under such agreements in a single arbitration proceeding.

                                   ARTICLE XVI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 16.1 COOPERATION. (a) The parties hereto shall cooperate in a
commercially reasonable manner in order that the duties assumed by URC will be
effectively, efficiently and promptly discharged. The parties hereto will use
their best efforts to (i) give effect to the intent of this Agreement and (ii)
refrain from conduct which would frustrate the intent of any such agreement.
Each party shall, at all reasonable times under the circumstances, make
available to the other party properly authorized personnel for the purpose of
consultation and decision.

         (b) URC shall reasonably cooperate with, and provide to the Royal
Insurer Affiliates, any assistance, information, data, reports and electronic
transmittals that the Royal Insurer Affiliates or their parent companies
reasonably may require beyond the scope of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 herein to enable
the Royal Insurer Affiliates or their parent companies to comply with Applicable
Law and any and all reporting and filing requirements and audits or inspections
by any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Royal Insurer Affiliates
or their parent companies.

         SECTION 16.2 AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER. This Agreement may not
be amended, modified or waived except by an instrument or instruments in writing
signed and delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 16.3 RELATIONSHIP. The Royal Insurer Affiliates and URC are and
shall remain independent contractors and not employees of the other party.
Except as expressly granted in this Agreement or otherwise by the other party in
writing or as may be required by Applicable Law or as necessary to perform the
services to be provided hereunder or to obtain the benefits hereof, no party
shall have any authority, express or implied, to act as an agent of the other
party or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under this Agreement. Except as
otherwise provided by this Agreement or by any other agreement between the
parties, each party shall be responsible for the payment of all employment,
income and social security taxes arising in connection with the compensation
payable to its personnel involved in the provision of the services hereunder.

                                       25

<PAGE>

         SECTION 16.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (together with the
exhibits hereto and the other agreements, documents and instruments delivered in
connection herewith) and the Acquisition Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and verbal, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

         SECTION 16.5 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.

         SECTION 16.6 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.

         SECTION 16.7 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         SECTION 16.8 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court in Delaware for the purposes of enforcing this
Agreement. In any action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise any claims that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of the above courts, that such action or suit is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is
improper. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable
judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other
proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or
judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within
or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award
or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment.

         SECTION 16.9 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

                                       26

<PAGE>

         SECTION 16.10 BINDING; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and legal representatives. Neither this Agreement, nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder, may be directly or indirectly assigned,
delegated, sublicensed or transferred by any party to this Agreement, in whole
or in part, to any other Person (including any bankruptcy trustee) by operation
of law or otherwise, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, without the prior
written consent of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 16.11 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties recognize and agree
that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be
an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any
other available remedies, each other party shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining any violation or threatened violation of any of the provisions of
this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of
security. In the event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce
any of the provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

         SECTION 16.12 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive article and section
headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

         SECTION 16.13 USE OF NAME. Except as otherwise set forth in the
Acquisition Agreement, URC shall use the name, trademark, service mark, logo or
identification of the Royal Insurer Affiliates without the Royal Insurer
Affiliates' prior written consent.

         SECTION 16.14 NOTICES. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be

         SECTION 16.15 INTERPRETATION.

         (a)      When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or
Article, such reference shall be to a section or article of this Agreement
unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The meaning assigned to each term used
in this Agreement shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the
plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender shall include all
genders. Where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical
forms shall have a corresponding meaning.

         (b)      The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement; consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.
