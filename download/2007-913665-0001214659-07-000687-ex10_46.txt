ARTICLE   4  -  ARIANESPACE' SERVICES



4.1     ARIANESPACE shall, for the Firm Launch and for the Firm Optional
        Launches if the related Launch Option(s) has/have been activated by
        CUSTOMER, perform the Services under this Agreement including :

        4.1.1   Launch Services.

                In the event that the ARIANE 5 launch immediately preceding a
                CUSTOMER's Launch under this Agreement (based on the ARIANESPACE
                manifest at the time of such failure) results in a launch
                failure due to an element of the said ARIANE 5 Launch Vehicle
                which could affect the Launch Vehicle version retained for the
                performance of CUSTOMER Launch, then CUSTOMER shall have the
                right to (i) re-schedule the Launch if such launch is the return
                to flight launch, or, (ii) to require ARIANESPACE to perform
                such Launch using a different configuration of ARIANE 5 Launch
                Vehicle if available; provided however that a launch failure due
                to an element that will not be used for the Launch shall not be
                taken into account for the purpose of this Paragraph. In the
                event that CUSTOMER elects to re-schedule the Launch pursuant to
                this Paragraph 4.1.1, then the new Launch Schedule for such
                Launch shall be determined in accordance with Paragraph
                11.2.1.1. The aggregate duration of postponements resulting from
                such Launch delay of SIX (6) months or less shall be deemed
                postponements by mutual agreement of the Parties and shall not
                be subject to the terms of any of Section 11.2.1.5, 11.3.4, or
                Paragraph 18.3, being further agreed that any resulting
                postponements exceeding that SIX (6) month period shall be
                treated as delays requested by ARIANESPACE in accordance with
                Sub-paragraph 11.3.1.

        4.1.2   Associated Services ordered by CUSTOMER as set forth in this
                Agreement, and as defined in Paragraph 1 ("General Range
                Support") and Paragraph 2 ("Options Ordered by the CUSTOMER") of
                Part 5 of Annex 1 to this Agreement, in accordance with the
                conditions as specified therein.

        4.1.3   Subject to any additional orders of CUSTOMER, one or more of the
                services as set forth in (i) Paragraph 3 ("Additional Options
                Available to the CUSTOMER") of Part 5 of Annex 1 to this
                Agreement, (ii) the latest issue of the User's Manual (M.U.A.)
                in effect on the date of the corresponding order of CUSTOMER, in
                accordance with the then applicable conditions and any other
                services ordered by CUSTOMER and accepted by ARIANESPACE.

4.2     Launch Services, except for Postlaunch Services, shall be deemed to be
        completed by ARIANESPACE when the Launch has taken place. In the event
        that, for any reason whatsoever, a Launch Abort occurs, ARIANESPACE
        shall postpone the Launch in accordance with the conditions set forth in
        Article 11 of this Agreement.

4.3     CUSTOMER shall have the right to exercise the Reflight Option by written
        request received by ARIANESPACE (i) within ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY (120)
        days following the Effective Date of this Agreement for the Firm Launch,
        and (ii) on the day of activation of the Launch Option for each
        respective Firm Optional Launch.

        If the CUSTOMER has selected the Reflight option and should the Launch
        Mission results in a:

        4.3.1   Launch Failure, ARIANESPACE shall perform a Reflight on an
                ARIANE 5 family Launch vehicle, in accordance with the
                provisions of this Agreement, provided that no further payment
                by CUSTOMER to ARIANESPACE shall be due for the provision of (i)
                Launch Services for the Launch of a replacement Satellite on
                condition that the maximum mass of such Satellite is equal to
                the mass of the initial Satellite, and (ii) such Associated
                Services as are retained by CUSTOMER as of the date of execution
                of this Agreement, except as provided for in Paragraph 8.2 of
                Article 8 of this Agreement, in case of postponement.

        4.3.2   Partial Failure, ARIANESPACE shall pay to CUSTOMER an amount as
                obtained by multiplying the Guarantee Amount by the Loss Quantum
                if the Launch Mission has resulted in a Partial Failure. The
                resulting amount will be subject to a deductible equal to PFF of
                the Guarantee Amount provided for the launching, in accordance
                with the following formula :

                      (Guarantee Amount x Loss Quantum) minus deductible.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the insurance policy taken out
                by CUSTOMER (i) provides for a deductible higher or lower than
                PFF, such deductible as provided for in the said insurance
                policy shall apply, or (ii) does not provide for a deductible,
                no deductible shall apply.

4.4     Any amount due by ARIANESPACE to CUSTOMER under Paragraph 4.3 above
        shall be paid within the SIXTY (60) day period following the date when
        the Parties have agreed on the occurrence of the Partial Failure and the
        corresponding Loss Quantum, provided CUSTOMER has paid all amounts due
        and payable by it under this Agreement.

4.5     The implementation of Paragraph 4.3 above shall not imply any transfer
        of title to the Satellite to ARIANESPACE. In case of Launch Failure or
        Partial Failure, the rights of ARIANESPACE shall be the same of those of
        any entity(ies) who could cover risks related to the launch of the
        Satellite. Specially and not limitatively, in circumstances where
        salvage can be performed, ARIANESPACE will be entitled to a share in any
        salvage value remaining in any portion of the Satellite for which a
        Reflight, a credit or a payment has been due by ARIANESPACE to CUSTOMER
        and will negotiate the disposition of the Satellite if transfer of title
        has been requested.

4.6     In the event that, after application of Paragraphs 4.3. above due to a
        Launch Failure, the Satellite is placed into commercial operation and/or
        is sold, leased or otherwise transferred, ARIANESPACE shall be entitled
        to a share of any resulting revenues and/or payments, as shall be
        negotiated and agreed upon promptly, taking into account the conditions
        peculiar to such commercial operation, but in no case shall any shared
        amount exceed the Guarantee Amount.

4.7     There shall not be any cover for Launch Failure or Partial Failure and
        consequently the provisions of Paragraph 4.3. of Article 4 hereof shall
        not apply, in any of the following cases :

        4.7.1   If CUSTOMER does not notify in writing ARIANESPACE of any event
                that would entitle CUSTOMER to any right under Paragraph 4.3 of
                Article 4 of this Agreement before the first to occur of any of
                the THREE (3) following events;

                hereabove might be obtained upon request from CUSTOMER if both
                of the following conditions occur:

                (a)     the launching does not conform to the specifications of
                        the D.C.I. and the Satellite reached its final
                        positioning such that it cannot be determined that a
                        Launch Failure or Partial Failure has occurred and;

                (b)     CUSTOMER's request for extension is received before the
                        first of the THREE (3) events specified above.

                In no event shall such extension extend beyond the ONE HUNDRED

                compatible with the Launch Vehicle configuration as identified
                in sub clause 3.1.2 of Part 1 "Launch Specifications" of Annex 1
                "Technical Annex" (as the same may be modified, without charge,

                The CUSTOMER's notice shall provide to ARIANESPACE all
                information concerning the different Satellite chosen
                (manufacturer, type of satellite, and estimated mass range).

                event within 30 days of any request for a Satellite substitution

                the Launch schedule and, if so, the particular reasons and basis
                therefore. In such event, CUSTOMER shall have the right within

        extend beyond such calendar year as a result of CUSTOMER's
        postponements, the then catalogue price for the relevant year will apply
        to such Associated Services (for which payment is required hereunder)
        that will not have been performed by the date of CUSTOMER request for
        any postponement, and that would have to be performed again as a
        consequence of any CUSTOMER Launch postponement. The yearly increase in
        the price for Associated Services price shall be limited to [***]% per
        year. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis for a Reflight.

        free from any and all taxes and other duties of any French tax
        authority. ARIANESPACE shall pay any such taxes and duties and defend
        and indemnify CUSTOMER against any claims therefore.

8.4     Wherever in this Agreement, CUSTOMER may be required to reimburse
        ARIANESPACE's costs hereunder, such costs shall be limited to
        ARIANESPACE's reasonable, documented, out of pocket expenses incurred
        for the benefit of CUSTOMER for work beyond that which would have
        otherwise been required of ARIANESPACE hereunder without additional
        charge.

                postpone the Launch Period and, once determined, the Launch Slot
                or the Launch Day. The CUSTOMER's written notice for
                postponement shall indicate the new requested (i) Launch Period,
                or (ii) Launch Slot, or (ii) Launch Day, as the case may be.

                11.2.1.1  If the CUSTOMER's written request relates to a
                          Launch Period or a Launch Slot postponement, as
                          soon as possible and in all events within TWO (2)
                          weeks of receipt of such request, ARIANESPACE
                          shall inform CUSTOMER whether a Launch Opportunity

                          Launch Day shall be made by mutual agreement of
                          the Parties, taking into account the technical
                          needs and interests of CUSTOMER, the time

                          during the countdown period. In the event that
                          CUSTOMER has requested such postponement and
                          technical reasons, including, without limitation,
                          or meteorological reasons prevent ARIANESPACE from

                          beyond July 31st 2008, then ARIANESPACE shall have

11.3    Launch postponement requested by ARIANESPACE

        11.3.1  ARIANESPACE shall have the right to postpone a Launch, for the
                following reasons :

                11.3.1.1  Postponement of Launch Period and of Launch Slot.

                     a)   ARIANESPACE or its Associates encounter adverse
                          technical problems, including if due to a Force
                          Majeure Event, that prevent the Launch from taking
                          place under satisfactory conditions of safety or
                          reliability.

                     b)   ARIANESPACE is requested to perform replacement
                          launch(es), or to launch scientific satellite(s)
                          whose mission(s) may be degraded in the event of
                          postponement.

                     c)   ARIANESPACE postpones the launch(es) due to
                          postponement(s) by ARIANESPACE of satellite(s)
                          having an earlier Launch Period or Launch Slot
                          than CUSTOMER's Satellite.

                11.3.1.2  Postponement of Launch Day within the Launch Slot
                          and/or Launch Time within the Launch Window.

                     a)   For any of the reasons listed in Sub-paragraph
                          11.3.1.1. a), b) and c) above, and

                     b)   If following its/their integration on the Launch
                          Vehicle, ARIANESPACE has to unload the Auxiliary
                          Payload(s) because of a threat to the Launch Mission
                          or the Satellite Mission.



        11.3.2  The Parties shall determine by mutual agreement a new Launch
                Period and/or a new Launch Slot as near as possible to the
                postponed one in accordance with the following criteria :

                -    possibilities of Launching;

                -    Launch Rank of CUSTOMER's Satellite;

                -    date of signature of this Agreement.

                The Launch Day and the Launch Window within the new Launch Slot
                shall be determined by ARIANESPACE according to the technical
                constraints of ARIANESPACE and CUSTOMER and both Parties'
                interests.

        11.3.3  Any postponement by ARIANESPACE of the Launch Period, Launch
                Slot, Launch Day, Launch Window, or Launch Time due to
                CUSTOMER's non-fulfillment of its obligations under this
                Agreement making the Launch impossible within the Launch Period,
                Launch Slot, or during Launch Window of the Launch Day, or at
                the Launch Time shall be considered to be requested by CUSTOMER
                in accordance with Paragraph 11.2 above as of the date of
                ARIANESPACE's decision to postpone the Launch.

        11.3.4  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the absence of termination of
                a related Launch in accordance with Article 18, in the event
                that the aggregate duration of all postponements requested by
                ARIANESPACE under Sub-paragraph 11.3 of Article 11 of this
                Agreement for a particular Launch under this Agreement should
                result in ARIANESPACE delaying such Launch by [***], the related
                Launch Services price shall be [***]. For clarity, whereinsoever
                this Agreement calls for the price to be increased or decreased
                by [***], the calculation shall be based upon [***].



11.4    Any CUSTOMER Launch postponement provided for in Paragraph 11.2 of this
        Article 11 (including for postponements requested by CUSTOMER as a
        result of the occurrence of Events of Force Majeure under circumstances
        where the Force Majeure would not affect ARIANESPACE's ability to
        perform, but for CUSTOMER's inability to timely fulfill its obligations)
        shall not modify the progress payment schedule set forth in Paragraph
        10.1 of Article 10 of this Agreement.

        Agreement, including, without limitation, the Launch Vehicle and the
        Launch Base of ARIANESPACE. Said property shall at all times be
        considered to be the sole property of ARIANESPACE.

ARTICLE   13  -  REPLACEMENT LAUNCH



13.1    Terms

        13.1.1  CUSTOMER is entitled to request a Replacement Launch from
                ARIANESPACE in the event that, following the Launch, either the
                Launch Mission or the Satellite Mission has not been
                accomplished for any reason whatsoever. Replacement Launch
                Services are subject to the conditions set forth in this Article
                13. Any and all other rights and remedies of CUSTOMER are
                excluded whatever their nature.

        13.1.2  CUSTOMER shall be entitled to have a Launch Slot for a
                Replacement Launch allocated to it by ARIANESPACE within EIGHT
                (8) months following the month ARIANESPACE has received a
                written request for Replacement Launch. Should CUSTOMER request
                a Launch Period beyond such EIGHT (8) month period, ARIANESPACE
                shall allocate the nearest Launch Opportunity, provided however
                that in no way shall the Launch Period requested by CUSTOMER
                extend beyond the THIRTY SIX (36) month period following the
                date of request for a Replacement Launch.

                Should CUSTOMER requests a Replacement Launch to occur at least
                SIX (6) months after, but within EIGHT (8) months, following the
                month that ARIANESPACE has received written request, ARIANESPACE
                shall allocate the nearest Launch Opportunity to CUSTOMER's
                request, subject to ARIANESPACE's ability using commercially
                reasonable efforts to complete all necessary mission analyses
                and integration activities within the period requested.

        13.1.3  The written request for a Replacement Launch shall be received
                by ARIANESPACE no later than the last day of the second month
                following the month in which the cause of the failure of either
                the Launch Vehicle Mission or the Satellite Mission has been
                established, but in no event later than, in the case of a
                Satellite Mission failure, TWENTY-SEVEN (27) months following
                the date of Launch.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CUSTOMER is entitled to a
                Reflight such written request shall be received by ARIANESPACE
                within the NINETY (90) day period following the date when the
                Parties have agreed that a Launch Failure has occurred.

                The written request for a Replacement Launch shall indicate the
                Launch Period requested by CUSTOMER within one of the periods
                specified in Sub-paragraph 13.1.2 above. It is understood that
                the replacement Satellite and all equipment, devices and
                software to be made available by CUSTOMER on the Launch Base in
                order to make the replacement Satellite ready for Launch shall
                be made available to ARIANESPACE pursuant to the schedule of
                Part 3 of Annex 1 to this Agreement.

        13.1.4  ARIANESPACE shall inform CUSTOMER, within the month following
                receipt of CUSTOMER's request for a Replacement Launch, whether
                or not a Launch Opportunity exists within the requested Launch
                Period and, in any event, shall allocate a Launch Slot to

                CUSTOMER, the first day of which shall be before the expiration
                of the EIGHT (8) calendar month period specified in
                Sub-paragraph 13.1.2 of Article 13 of this Agreement, if the
                Launch Period requested by CUSTOMER is within that EIGHT (8)
                month period; otherwise ARIANESPACE shall allocate to CUSTOMER
                the nearest existing Launch Opportunity. The date allocated
                shall not begin earlier than the first day of the Launch Period
                requested by CUSTOMER.

        13.1.5  The replacement Satellite shall be in accordance with the
                interface control document (DCI) governing CUSTOMER's Satellite.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CUSTOMER is entitled to a
                Reflight the replacement Satellite may differ from the DCI. In
                such a case the Parties agree to adjust accordingly this
                Agreement, including Annex 1 thereto and ARIANESPACE shall
                allocate to CUSTOMER the nearest Launch Opportunity.

14.1    Allocation of Risks for damage caused by one Party and/or its Associates
        to the Other Party and/or its Associates:

        14.1.1  Due to the particular nature of the Services, the Parties agree
                that any liability of ARIANESPACE or of CUSTOMER arising from
                the defective, late, or non-performance of ARIANESPACE's
                Services and CUSTOMER's technical obligations under this
                Agreement shall, in all circumstances other than willful
                misconduct by such Party, including termination of this
                Agreement or a Launch under this Agreement, be strictly limited
                to the liability expressly provided for in this Agreement.
                Except as provided in this Agreement, the Parties hereto
                expressly waive, renounce, and exclude any and all rights and
                remedies that may arise at law or in equity with respect to the
                Services. The waivers, assumptions and indemnifications of and
                for liability by a Party in this Article 14 shall not act to
                waive any claim for, to assume, or to indemnify the other Party
                and/or its Associates for any liability based on willful or
                intentional misconduct or fraud of the other Party and/or its
                Associates.

        14.1.2  Each Party shall bear any and all loss of or damage to property

                injury (including death), and/or of a Launch Mission failure
                and/or of a Satellite Mission failure, which it or its
                Associates may sustain, directly or indirectly, arising out of
                or relating to this Agreement or the performance of this
                Agreement. Each Party irrevocably agrees to a no-fault,
                no-subrogation, inter-party waiver of liability, and waives the
                right to make any claims or to initiate any proceedings whether
                judicial, arbitral, or administrative on account of any such

                Mission failure and/or Satellite Mission failure against the
                other Party or that other Party's Associates arising out of or

                of ARIANESPACE or its Associates for any loss or damages to
                CUSTOMER or its Associates, resulting from the intentional
                destruction of the Launch Vehicle and the Satellite in
                furtherance of launch range safety measures.

                Each Party agrees to bear the financial and any other
                consequences of such loss, damage or bodily injury (including
                death) and/or of a Launch Mission failure and/or a Satellite
                Mission failure which it or its Associates may sustain, without
                recourse to the other Party or the other Party's Associates.

        14.1.3  In the event that one or more Associates of a Party shall
                proceed against the other Party and/or that Party's Associates
                as a result of such loss, damage or bodily injury (including

                this Agreement and/or the launch services agreement signed by

                this Sub-paragraph 18.2.3, in the case of a Reflight, the
                Guarantee Amount shall be deemed to have been a payment by

        a particular postponement, any anticipated Launch, beyond reasonable
        dispute) should result in ARIANESPACE delaying a particular CUSTOMER's
        Launch under this Agreement by more than SIX (6) months, CUSTOMER shall
        have the right, to terminate the Launch concerned, in which case

                                                                         Page 47


        event, CUSTOMER shall be liable only for the payment of Associated
        Services performed, at CUSTOMER's cost, for the Launch terminated prior
        to the date of termination , provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
        no charge shall be made for Associated Services which are specified
        herein to be provided without charge by Arianespace. For the purpose of
        this Paragraph 18.3, in the case of a Reflight, the Guarantee Amount
        shall be deemed to have been a payment by CUSTOMER.

        The foregoing notwithstanding, prior to giving notice of termination,
        CUSTOMER shall have given ARIANESPACE at least THIRTY (30) days' notice
        of CUSTOMER's intent to do so (which in the case of delay, may occur as
        early as the point of FIVE (5) months of delay, so as to allow a
        termination notice to be effective at SIX (6) months), allowing for
        discussion between the Parties of any alternative solution other than
        termination.

        However, postponements resulting from (i) Events of Force Majeure in the
        aggregate of of SIX (6) months or less; and/or (ii) any damage caused by
        CUSTOMER and/or its Associates to the property of ARIANESPACE and/or the
        property of its Associates; and/or (iii) any bodily injury (including
        death) caused by CUSTOMER and/or its Associates to ARIANESPACE and/or
        its Associates shall not be taken into account for the computation of
        the above mentioned period.

        In the event that CUSTOMER has an unexercised right to terminate under
        this Paragraph 18.3, ARIANESPACE may, upon written notice to CUSTOMER,
        request CUSTOMER either to exercise such right within THIRTY (30) Days
        of ARIANESPACE's written notice or, failing to do so, waive such right;
        provided that such waiver shall not be applicable to any further delay
        in a Launch beyond that previously notified by ARIANESPACE to CUSTOMER.


18.4    CUSTOMER may, upon written notice to ARIANESPACE, terminate immediately
        the Launch concerned in any event of any material breach by ARIANESPACE
        of its obligations arising of this Agreement, not otherwise provided for
        in Sub-Paragraph 18.3, and in each case does not cure such failure
        within THIRTY (30) Days of written notice of such material breach from
        CUSTOMER to ARIANESPACE, as may be extended in writing by CUSTOMER. In
        the event that ARIANESPACE does not cure such failure within the cure
        period specified in the preceding sentence, ARIANESPACE shall refund to
        CUSTOMER all payments made by CUSTOMER for the Launch concerned within
        THIRTY (30) days of termination notice. In such an event, CUSTOMER shall
        be liable only for the payment of Associated Services performed and
        delivered, at CUSTOMER's cost, for the Launch so terminated prior to the
        date of termination, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no
        charge shall be made for Associated Services which are specified herein
        to be provided without charge by Arianespace. For the purpose of this
        Paragraph 18.4, in the case of a Reflight, the Guarantee Amount shall be
        deemed to have been a payment by CUSTOMER.

        within THIRTY (30) days after the date of receipt of a written notice to
        that effect ARIANESPACE shall be entitled to terminate the Launch
        concerned by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt.



19.2    In the event of termination by ARIANESPACE pursuant to the provisions of

20.5    Assignment

        Neither Party shall be entitled to assign its rights, title, interest or
        obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior
        written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
        withheld or delayed.

        The foregoing notwithstanding, CUSTOMER shall be entitled to assign in
        whole, (or, subject to the further qualification stated in the following
        paragraph, in part by Launch) its rights, title, interest and
        obligations under this Agreement, to: (A) an entity (a "Successor
        Entity"), which may include new investors, to which all or substantially
        all of the assets of the CUSTOMER as of the date hereof are also
        assigned or into which CUSTOMER is merged, or (B) to any of Motient
        Corporation, a Delaware corporation, TerreStar Networks (Canada) Inc., a
        corporation incorporated under the laws of the province of Ontario
        (Canada), or TerreStar Networks Bermuda Ltd., a company existing under
        the laws of Bermuda, provided such assignment by the CUSTOMER shall not
        constitute a novation as to CUSTOMER's underlying payment obligations to
        ARIANESPACE pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including but not
        limited to the obligation to pay all amounts due, unless the CUSTOMER
        demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of ARIANESPACE that the
        assignee has the financial capacity and willingness to meet all such
        payment obligations to ARIANESPACE as and when the same shall be due and
        payable and that the risk of non payment by the Successor Entity is not
        greater than such risk in respect of CUSTOMER as at the date hereof.

        Customer's right of assignment in clause (B) immediately above is
        further qualified as follows: Customer shall not be permitted, without
        Arianespace's consent, to assign its rights, title, interests or
        obligations under this Agreement with respect to either Optional Launch
        by operation of clause (B) above to any entity other than whom the
        entire Agreement is assigned (or to whom a permitted assignment of
        Optional Launch #1 has already been made) prior to the time that
        Customer shall have activated the applicable Launch Option.

        In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, CUSTOMER shall have the
        right, without further consent of ARIANESPACE, as security for any
        financing (including any financing obtained by any parent or subsidiary
        of CUSTOMER guaranteed or otherwise supported by CUSTOMER), to assign or
        grant security interests in this Agreement, provided in the case of any
        assignment of this Agreement to any party, other than a lender or other
        financing party or agent or trustee for any such lender or financing
        party (and other than as permitted in this Paragraph 20.5 above),
        ARIANESPACE consents to such assignment, which consent shall not be
        unreasonably delayed or withheld.

        Except as provided above, any attempt to assign any rights or
        obligations hereunder without the other party's prior written consent
        shall be null and void.



20.6    Entire Agreement and Modifications

        and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous discussions between the
        Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Neither
        Party shall be bound by the conditions, warranties, definitions,

        registered by a state of registry in accordance with the Convention on
        Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space of 1974 either (i)
        directly, if CUSTOMER is a state or the state designated by an

ARTICLE   22  -  ARBITRATION



In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Parties shall use their best efforts to reach an amicable settlement. If an
amicable settlement cannot be achieved, the dispute shall be referred to the
President of ARIANESPACE and of CUSTOMER, who will use their best efforts to
reach a settlement. Should an amicable settlement fail, the dispute shall be
finally settled under the rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce ("I.C.C.") in Paris by THREE (3) arbitrators
appointed in accordance with the then existing rules of the I.C.C. The
arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The award of the
arbitrators shall be final, conclusive and binding, and the execution thereof
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.


Notwithstanding the above, either Party may request expedited arbitration as to
any dispute hereunder if the nature of the dispute involves a time sensitive
matter as to which a delay in resolution would cause material prejudice to such
Party or force it to proceed at material risk (the "Request"). Such Request
shall specify the matter in dispute. Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator
within TEN (10) days of the request and shall ask these TWO (2) arbitrators to
appoint a third arbitrator within TEN (10) days. Within TWENTY (20) days of the
Request, each Party shall provide the other with copies of documentation in its
possession and with a summary in writing of other communications within its
knowledge that it deems relevant to the matter in dispute. Each Party shall
cooperate with the other and requests that the arbitrators establish a schedule
that shall lead to a resolution of the matter within SIXTY (60) days of the
Request.

                     E.S.A./ARIANESPACE Convention (Extract)




Certain European Governments, members of the European Space Agency, (hereinafter
referred to as "the Participants") have committed themselves to using the Ariane
Launcher, developed within the framework of the European Space Agency
programmes. Arianespace must provide the European Space Agency and the
Participants, as a priority, with the services and launch slots necessary for
their programmes. Arianespace must also make sure that in the event of a shift
in the launch slots caused by the launcher system and/or any of the technical
equipment which has to be used for the launch, the payload concerned of the
Agency or Participant retains its position in the launch schedule. In addition,
in the event of the failure of an Agency or Participant mission, the Agency or
Participant may ask Arianespace to provide them, for a new launch, with the
first or failing that the second launch slot compatible with the availability of
the replacement payload if the failure was due to the launch system and/or any
of the technical equipment used for the launch, and the first compatible slot or
failing that the first slot scheduled at the latest 10 months after the written
relaunch request if the failure was due to the payload itself. Finally,
Arianespace has committed itself to the Agency and to the Participants to pay
particular attention to the specific requirements imposed by scientific
missions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   Documentation

The description of main documentation to be issued by CUSTOMER and ARIANESPACE
in order to prepare the Mission can be found in the MUA 5.

1.1  DUA

In accordance with the MUA, the customer will issue the Application to Use
Ariane [DUA], which contains the essential requirements and information for the
correct execution of the Launch Service.

1.2  DCI

Based on the DUA Inputs, ARIANESPACE will issue the Interface Control Document
[DCI] between the Spacecraft and the Launch System. This first Issue 0 will be
discussed, updated, approved, and signed as Issue 1 by the CUSTOMER and
ARIANESPACE.

The DCI Issue 1 will be maintained under formal Configuration Control until the
Launch, and becomes the unique working document for all technical interfaces
between the Spacecraft and the Launch System.

The DCI Issue 2, specific to each Spacecraft Launch, is prepared and released
following the relevant Final Mission Analysis Review (RAMF).


1.3  Mission Analysis Documentation

The CUSTOMER and ARIANESPACE will issue input and output data related to the
Mission, the Qualification and Acceptance process of the Spacecraft, Operations
and Safety, respectively. These documents (as described in tables hereunder) are
intended to:

o    Specify the Mission Requirements

o    To demonstrate the compatibility of the ARIANE mission with the CUSTOMER
     requirements.

o    To demonstrate the compatibility of the Spacecraft with the ARIANE flight
     environment and specifications.

The timely availability and validity of such documentation, especially Mission
Analysis Inputs, is essential for the preparation of the Launch. Therefore,
where review and/or approval are required, turn around time of documents should
be less than 2 weeks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The review is co-chaired by the ARIANE Production Project Manager (CPAP) and the
Launch Vehicle Quality Synthesis Responsible (RSQL).

At that time, all flight hardware, stages, vehicle equipment bay, fairing,
SYLDA5 and adaptors, are reviewed, through comprehensive documentation
(available at Arianespace). The documentation covers, but is not limited to,
hardware identification, performance test results and major waivers, anomalies
and failures during tests, life limitations, on-going production status of same
equipment, etc... The Payload status is also presented (mission, flight program,
waivers, etc...).

The RAV documentation will be made available to CUSTOMER during the review.

     2.2.2  POC Readiness Review (BT POC)

This review is performed before the start of the Combined Operations (POC). It
allows ARIANESPACE Management to authorise the start of the Combined Operations
(POC) between the Launch Vehicle and the Spacecrafts. The CUSTOMER is required
to provide a Spacecraft readiness status to start the POC activities.

The review is chaired by the Ariane Mission Director (CM) and it covers the
readiness status with respect to the POC activities of:

     The Launch Vehicle, (including RAF debriefing)
     The Ariane Launch Complex (ELA),
     The Spacecraft.

All participants to the Review receive a comprehensive set of summary documents
presenting the readiness status of all the parties.

The Launch Vehicle Functional Review (RAF) is an internal ARIANESPACE review of
the Launch Vehicle status before the transfer of the Launch Vehicle to the BAF.

     2.2.3  Launch Readiness Review (RAL)

This review takes places at the launch site at D-2, i.e. two days before the
Launch day. It allows ARIANESPACE Management to authorise the start of the
Launch Vehicle filling operations and the final countdown. CUSTOMER is requested
to attend; in any case, the final Spacecraft flight readiness status is
required.


A pre-RAL meeting will be organised by ARIANESPACE prior to the actual review in
order to:

o    Inform the CUSTOMER of the significant items that will be presented in the
     RAL,
o    Provide any additional clarification that may result from previous written
     questions raised by the CUSTOMER.

E - Quality Reporting

A dedicated access right and adequate visibility on the Quality          E 10        [***]           [***]
Assurance (QA) system can be given through the steps listed below :

o    Quality System Presentation
A Quality System Presentation (QSP) is included in the agenda of the
contractual Kick-off Meeting. This general presentation explicitly
reviews the Product Assurance provisions defined in the ARIANESPACE
QUALITY MANUAL.

o    Quality Status Meeting
A specific Quality Status Meeting (QSM) may be organized about 12
months before the Launch with special emphasis on major Quality and
Reliability aspects (including failure reporting), relevant to the
CUSTOMER Launch Vehicle batch. In addition, visits to main contractor
facilities may be organized, if necessary.

o    Quality Status Review
A Quality Status Review (QSR) may be organized about four months
before the Launch to review the CUSTOMER Launch Vehicle hardware.


In the same time frame, and if necessary, special assistance is
provided to the CUSTOMER to facilitate his understanding of the
ARIANE Quality Documentation that builds up progressively.


The information given to the CUSTOMER is subject to the
confidentiality provisions described in Article 16 of the Agreement.
