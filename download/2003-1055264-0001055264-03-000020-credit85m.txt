         (a) Revolving Commitment.


              (i)  Loans.  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  hereof  and in
         reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, each
         Lender  severally  (and not  jointly)  agrees to make  available to the
         Borrower  revolving  credit loans  requested by the Borrower in Dollars
         ("Revolving  Loans")  from time to time from the Closing Date until the
         Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Revolving  Commitments shall
         have been terminated as provided herein;  provided,  however,  that (A)
         the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the Revolving
         Committed  Amount and (y) the Borrowing  Base Amount for such date, and
         (B) with regard to each Lender  individually,  such  Lender's  Pro Rata
         Share of outstanding Revolving Loans, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share
         of the outstanding  LOC Obligations  shall not exceed such Lender's Pro
         Rata  Share of the  Revolving  Committed  Amount.  Revolving  Loans may
         consist  of Base  Rate  Loans or  Eurodollar  Loans,  or a  combination
         thereof, as the Borrower may request; provided, however, that there may
         be no more than seven (7)  Eurodollar  Loans which are Revolving  Loans
         outstanding  hereunder at any given time (it being understood that, for
         purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall
         be considered as separate  Eurodollar  Loans, even if they begin on the
         same date,  although  borrowings,  extensions and  conversions  may, in
         accordance  with  the  provisions  hereof,  be  combined  at the end of
         existing  Interest  Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar  Loan with a
         single Interest Period).

              (ii)  Reborrowing.  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of this
         Credit  Agreement,  during the period  from the  Effective  Date to but
         excluding  the  Maturity  Date,  the  Borrower  may  borrow,  repay and
         reborrow Revolving Loans hereunder.

         (b) Revolving Loan Borrowings.

         (i) Notice of  Borrowing.  The Borrower  shall give the  Administrative
         Agent  notice  pursuant to a Loan Notice or  telephonic  notice of each
         borrowing  of Revolving  Loans.  Each Loan Notice shall be delivered to
         the Administrative Agent before 12:00 P.M. on the Business Day prior to
         the date of the requested borrowing in the case of Base Rate Loans, and
         on the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested  borrowing
         in the case of Eurodollar  Loans. Each such request for borrowing shall
         be  irrevocable,  shall  contain  certifications  of the Borrower  with
         respect to the  conditions set forth in Section 5.2 clauses (b) through
         (d) in the form of Exhibit C, and shall  specify  (A) that a  Revolving
         Loan is requested, (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which shall
         be a Business Day), (C) the aggregate  principal amount to be borrowed,
         and (D) whether the  borrowing  shall be  comprised of Base Rate Loans,
         Eurodollar Loans or a combination  thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are
         requested,  the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail
         to specify in any such Loan Notice (I) an applicable Interest Period in
         the case of a Eurodollar Loan, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request  for an  Interest  Period  of one  month,  or (II)  the type of
         Revolving  Loan  requested,  then such  notice  shall be deemed to be a
         request  for a Base Rate Loan  hereunder.  Any such  telephonic  notice
         shall include all  information to be specified in a written Loan Notice
         and shall be promptly  confirmed in writing by the Borrower pursuant to
         a Loan Notice sent to the Administrative  Agent by telecopy on the same
         day of the giving of such telephonic notice.  The Administrative  Agent
         will transmit by telecopy the Loan Notice (or the information contained
         in such Loan  Notice)  to each  Lender  promptly  upon  receipt  by the
         Administrative  Agent.  Each Loan Notice or  telephonic  notice of each
         borrowing shall be irrevocable once given and binding on the Borrower.

         (ii) Minimum Amounts.  Each Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan that is a
         Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate  principal amount of (A)
         $2,000,000  in the case of Eurodollar  Loans and (B)  $1,000,000 in the
         case of Base Rate Loans, in each case in integral multiples of $500,000
         in  excess  thereof  (or  (1) the  remaining  amount  of the  Revolving
         Committed  Amount,  or (2) the remaining  amount of the Borrowing  Base
         Amount,  in each case if such amount is less than the amounts set forth
         in clauses (A) and (B)).

         (iii)  Advances.  Each  Lender  will  make its Pro  Rata  Share of each
         Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Administrative  Agent for the
         account of the  Borrower as specified  in Section  3.17(a),  or in such
         other  manner as the  Administrative  Agent may  reasonably  specify in
         writing,  by 1:00 P.M. on the date  specified  in the  applicable  Loan
         Notice  in  Dollars  and  in  funds   immediately   available   to  the
         Administrative  Agent. With respect to Revolving Loans to be made after
         the Effective  Date,  unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have been
         notified by any Lender prior to the  specified  date of borrowing  that
         such Lender  does not intend to make  available  to the  Administrative
         Agent the  Revolving  Loan to be made by such Lender on such date,  the
         Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will make the proceeds
         of such  Revolving Loan  available to the  Administrative  Agent on the
         date of the requested borrowing as set forth in the Loan Notice and the
         Administrative  Agent may (but shall not be obligated  to), in reliance
         upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower the amount of such
         Revolving Loan to be provided by such Lender. The Administrative  Agent
         shall,  no later than 2:00 P.M. on the date specified on the applicable
         Loan Notice and subject to the  conditions set forth in Article V, make
         such  borrowing  available to the Borrower by crediting  the account of
         the Borrower  with the  aggregate of the amounts made  available to the
         Administrative  Agent by the  Lenders  and in like funds as received by
         the Administrative Agent.

         (c) Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving Loans shall be due
and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless  accelerated sooner pursuant to
Section 9.2.

         (d)  Interest.  Subject to the  provisions of Section 3.1, the Borrower
promises  to pay to the  Administrative  Agent for account of each Lender on the
unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Lender for the period from and
including  the making of such Loan to but  excluding the date such Loan shall be
paid in full, as follows:

              (i) Base Rate Loans.  During such periods as Revolving Loans shall
         be  comprised  in whole or in part of Base Rate  Loans,  such Base Rate
         Loans  shall bear  interest  at a per annum rate equal to the  Adjusted
         Base Rate.

              (ii)  Eurodollar  Loans.  During such periods as  Revolving  Loans
         shall  be  comprised  in  whole or in part of  Eurodollar  Loans,  such
         Eurodollar  Loans shall bear  interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

         Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be specified
herein). Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided for
herein or any change therein, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof
to the Lenders and to the Borrower. All determinations by the Administrative
Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the
Lenders and the Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (e) Revolving Notes.


              (i)  Revolving  Notes.  Any Lender may request that the  Revolving
         Loans  made  by it  shall  be  evidenced  by a  promissory  note of the
         Borrower  substantially  in the form of  Exhibit  F (each a  "Revolving
         Note"), payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal
         to the amount of its  Revolving  Commitment as originally in effect and
         otherwise duly completed.

              (ii) Records. The date, amount of each Loan made by each Lender to
         the  Borrower,  and  each  payment  made on  account  of the  principal
         thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books and such entries
         shall be binding on the Borrower absent manifest error.

Section 2.2 Letter of Credit Subfacility.

         (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.

              (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,  (A) the
         Issuing  Lender  agrees,  in reliance upon the  agreements of the other
         Lenders  set forth in this  Section  2.2,  (1) from time to time on any
         Business  Day during the period from the Closing  Date until the Letter
         of Credit  Expiration  Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account
         of the Borrower,  and to amend Letters of Credit  previously  issued by
         it, in accordance  with  subsection (b) below,  and (2) to honor drafts
         under the  Letters of Credit;  and (B) the Lenders  severally  agree to
         participate  in  Letters  of  Credit  issued  for  the  account  of the
         Borrower;  provided  that the Issuing  Lender shall not be obligated to
         make any LOC Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, and
         no Lender shall be obligated to  participate in any Letter of Credit if
         as of the date of and after giving effect to such LOC Credit Extension,
         (x) the LOC Obligations  outstanding exceed the LOC Committed Amount or
         (y) the Total  Outstandings  exceed  the  lesser  of (A) the  Revolving
         Committed  Amount and (B) the  Borrowing  Base.  Within  the  foregoing
         limits,  and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's
         ability  to obtain  Letters  of Credit  shall be fully  revolving,  and
         accordingly  the Borrower  may,  during the  foregoing  period,  obtain
         Letters of Credit to replace  Letters  of Credit  that have  expired or
         that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.

              (ii) The Issuing  Lender shall be under no obligation to issue any
         Letter of Credit if:

                   (A)  any  order,  judgment  or  decree  of  any  Governmental
              Authority or  arbitrator  shall by its terms  purport to enjoin or
              restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or
              any  Law  applicable  to the  Issuing  Lender  or any  request  or
              directive  (whether  or not  having  the  force  of law)  from any
              Governmental  Authority with  jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender
              shall  prohibit,  or request that the Issuing Lender refrain from,
              the  issuance  of letters of credit  generally  or such  Letter of
              Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing  Lender with
              respect  to such  Letter of Credit  any  restriction,  reserve  or
              capital requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise
              compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall
              impose  upon the Issuing  Lender any  unreimbursed  loss,  cost or
              expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the
              Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it;

                   (B) the expiry date of such requested  Letter of Credit would
              occur more than twelve  months after the date of issuance,  unless
              the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                   (C) the expiry date of such requested  Letter of Credit would
              occur after the Letter of Credit  Expiration Date,  unless all the
              Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                   (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit  would  violate one
              or more policies of the Issuing Lender; or

                   (E) such  Letter of Credit is in an initial  amount less than
              $500,000,  or  is to  be  denominated  in a  currency  other  than
              Dollars.

              (iii) The Issuing Lender shall be under no obligation to amend any
         Letter of Credit if (A) the Issuing  Lender would have no obligation at
         such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended  form under the
         terms hereof,  or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not
         accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

         (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit.

              (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended,  as the case
         may be,  upon the  request of the  Borrower  delivered  to the  Issuing
         Lender  (with  a copy to the  Administrative  Agent)  in the  form of a
         Letter of Credit Application,  appropriately completed and signed by an
         Executive  Officer of the Borrower.  Such Letter of Credit  Application
         must be received by the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent not
         later than 11:00 a.m.  at least two  Business  Days (or such later date
         and time as the Issuing  Lender may agree in a  particular  instance in
         its sole  discretion)  prior to the proposed  issuance  date or date of
         amendment,  as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial
         issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
         specify in form and detail  satisfactory to the Issuing Lender: (A) the
         proposed  issuance date of the requested  Letter of Credit (which shall
         be a  Business  Day);  (B) the  amount  thereof;  (C) the  expiry  date
         thereof;  (D) the name and address of the beneficiary  thereof; (E) the
         documents to be presented  by such  beneficiary  in case of any drawing
         thereunder;  (F) the full text of any  certificate  to be  presented by
         such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder;  and (G) such other
         matters as the Issuing Lender may require. In the case of a request for
         an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
         Application  shall  specify  in form  and  detail  satisfactory  to the
         Issuing Lender (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed
         date of  amendment  thereof  (which shall be a Business  Day);  (C) the
         nature of the  proposed  amendment;  and (D) such other  matters as the
         Issuing Lender may require.

              (ii) Promptly  after receipt of any Letter of Credit  Application,
         the  Issuing  Lender will  confirm  with the  Administrative  Agent (by
         telephone or in writing) that the  Administrative  Agent has received a
         copy of such Letter of Credit  Application  from the  Borrower  and, if
         not, the Issuing  Lender will provide the  Administrative  Agent with a
         copy thereof.  Upon receipt by the Issuing Lender of confirmation  from
         the  Administrative  Agent that the requested  issuance or amendment is
         permitted in  accordance  with the terms hereof,  then,  subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender shall, on the requested
         date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter
         into the  applicable  amendment,  as the case may be,  in each  case in
         accordance  with the  Issuing  Lender's  usual and  customary  business
         practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
         Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally
         agrees to,  purchase from the Issuing  Lender a risk  participation  in
         such  Letter  of  Credit  in an  amount  equal to the  product  of such
         Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

              (iii)  Promptly  after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any
         amendment  to a Letter  of  Credit to an  advising  bank  with  respect
         thereto or to the  beneficiary  thereof,  the Issuing  Lender will also
         deliver  to the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative  Agent  a true  and
         complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

         (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

              (i) Upon receipt from the  beneficiary  of any Letter of Credit of
         any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender
         shall notify the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent  thereof.  Not
         later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the Issuing  Lender
         under a Letter  of Credit  (each  such  date,  an  "Honor  Date"),  the
         Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender through the  Administrative
         Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower
         fails  to  so  reimburse   the  Issuing   Lender  by  such  time,   the
         Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify each Lender of the Honor
         Date,  the  amount  of  the  unreimbursed  drawing  (the  "Unreimbursed
         Amount"),  and the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share  thereof.  In
         such event,  the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate
         Loan to be  disbursed  on the  Honor  Date in an  amount  equal  to the
         Unreimbursed  Amount  without  regard  to  the  minimum  and  multiples
         specified in Section 2.1 for the  principal  amount of Base Rate Loans,
         but subject to the amount of the  unutilized  portion of the  Revolving
         Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the
         delivery of a Loan Notice).  Any notice given by the Issuing  Lender or
         the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant to this Section  2.2(c)(i)  may be
         given by telephone if immediately  confirmed in writing;  provided that
         the  lack  of such an  immediate  confirmation  shall  not  affect  the
         conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

              (ii) Each Lender  (including the Lender acting as Issuing  Lender)
         shall  upon  any  notice  pursuant  to  Section  2.2(c)(i)  make  funds
         available  to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of the Issuing
         Lender at the  Administrative  Agent's Office in an amount equal to its
         Pro Rata Share of the  Unreimbursed  Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on
         the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative  Agent,
         whereupon,  subject  to the  provisions  of Section  2.2(c)(iii),  each
         Lender  that so makes  funds  available  shall be deemed to have made a
         Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent
         shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Lender.

              (iii) With  respect to any  Unreimbursed  Amount that is not fully
         refinanced  by a Base Rate Loan  because  the  conditions  set forth in
         Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other  reason,  the Borrower
         shall be  deemed  to have  incurred  from  the  Issuing  Lender  an LOC
         Borrowing  in the  amount  of the  Unreimbursed  Amount  that is not so
         refinanced,  which LOC  Borrowing  shall be due and  payable  on demand
         (together  with  interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.
         In such event,  each Lender's payment to the  Administrative  Agent for
         the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section  2.2(c)(ii) shall
         be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such LOC Borrowing
         and shall constitute an LOC Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of
         its participation obligation under this Section 2.2.

              (iv) Until  each  Lender  funds its Base Rate Loan or LOC  Advance
         pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any
         amount  drawn  under any Letter of Credit,  interest in respect of such
         Lender's  Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account
         of the Issuing Lender.

              (v)  Each  Lender's  obligation  to make  Base  Rate  Loans or LOC
         Advances  to  reimburse  the  Issuing  Lender for  amounts  drawn under
         Letters of Credit,  as contemplated  by this Section  2.2(c),  shall be
         absolute   and   unconditional   and  shall  not  be  affected  by  any
         circumstance,  including  (A) any  set-off,  counterclaim,  recoupment,
         defense or other right  which such Lender may have  against the Issuing
         Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B)
         the  occurrence  or  continuance  of  a  Default,   or  (C)  any  other
         occurrence,  event or  condition,  whether or not similar to any of the
         foregoing;  provided,  however,  that each Lender's  obligation to make
         Committed  Loans  pursuant  to this  Section  2.2(c) is  subject to the
         conditions  set  forth in  Section  5.2  (other  than  delivery  by the
         Borrower of a Loan  Notice).  No such  making of an LOC  Advance  shall
         relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
         the Issuing  Lender for the amount of any  payment  made by the Issuing
         Lender under any Letter of Credit,  together  with interest as provided
         herein.

              (vi) If any Lender fails to make  available to the  Administrative
         Agent for the account of the Issuing  Lender any amount  required to be
         paid  by such  Lender  pursuant  to the  foregoing  provisions  of this
         Section 2.2(c) by the time specified in Section 2.2(c)(ii), the Issuing
         Lender  shall be entitled to recover from such Lender  (acting  through
         the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon
         for the period  from the date such  payment is  required to the date on
         which such payment is immediately  available to the Issuing Lender at a
         rate per annum  equal to the  Federal  Funds  Rate from time to time in
         effect.  A certificate  of the Issuing  Lender  submitted to any Lender
         (through the  Administrative  Agent) with respect to any amounts  owing
         under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) Repayment of Participations.

              (i) At any time after the Issuing  Lender has made a payment under
         any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's LOC
         Advance in respect of such payment in accordance  with Section  2.2(c),
         if the  Administrative  Agent  receives  for the account of the Issuing
         Lender any  payment in respect of the  related  Unreimbursed  Amount or
         interest  thereon  (whether  directly  from the Borrower or  otherwise,
         including   proceeds  of  Cash   Collateral   applied  thereto  by  the
         Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
         Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately  adjusted, in the case
         of interest  payments,  to reflect the period of time during which such
         Lender's  LOC  Advance  was  outstanding)  in the  same  funds as those
         received by the Administrative Agent.

              (ii) If any payment received by the  Administrative  Agent for the
         account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i) is required
         to be  returned  under any of the  circumstances  described  in Section
         11.22 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing
         Lender in its discretion),  each Lender shall pay to the Administrative
         Agent for the account of the Issuing  Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof
         on demand of the  Administrative  Agent, plus interest thereon from the
         date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender,
         at a rate per annum equal to the  Federal  Funds Rate from time to time
         in effect.

         (e) Obligations  Absolute.  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
the  Issuing  Lender for each  drawing  under each Letter of Credit and to repay
each LOC Borrowing shall be absolute,  unconditional and irrevocable,  and shall
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

         (i) any lack of  validity or  enforceability  of such Letter of Credit,
         this Credit  Agreement,  or any other agreement or instrument  relating
         thereto;

         (ii) the  existence  of any claim,  counterclaim,  set-off,  defense or
         other  right  that  the  Borrower  may  have at any  time  against  any
         beneficiary  or any  transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person
         for whom any such  beneficiary  or any such  transferee may be acting),
         the Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this
         Credit  Agreement,  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  or by such
         Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument  relating  thereto,  or
         any unrelated transaction;

         (iii) any draft, demand,  certificate or other document presented under
         such  Letter of Credit  proving  to be forged,  fraudulent,  invalid or
         insufficient  in any respect or any  statement  therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;  or any loss or delay in the transmission or
         otherwise  of any  document  required in order to make a drawing  under
         such Letter of Credit; or

         (iv) any  payment by the  Issuing  Lender  under such  Letter of Credit
         against  presentation of a draft or certificate  that does not strictly
         comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;  or any payment made by
         the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting
         to be a trustee in bankruptcy,  debtor-in-possession,  assignee for the
         benefit of creditors,  liquidator,  receiver or other representative of
         or successor to any  beneficiary  or any  transferee  of such Letter of
         Credit,  including any arising in connection with any proceeding  under
         any Debtor Relief Law.

The  Borrower  shall  promptly  examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each
amendment  thereto  that is  delivered  to it and,  in the event of any claim of
noncompliance  with  the  Borrower's  instructions  or other  irregularity,  the
Borrower  will  immediately  notify the Issuing  Lender.  The Borrower  shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the Issuing Lender and
its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

         (f) Role of Issuing Lender. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in
paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit,  the Issuing  Lender shall not have
any  responsibility  to  obtain  any  document  (other  than  any  sight  draft,
certificates  and  documents  expressly  required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such  document or the
authority of the Person  executing or delivering any such document.  None of the
Issuing   Lender,   any   Agent-Related   Person  nor  any  of  the   respective
correspondents,  participants or assignees of the Issuing Lender shall be liable
to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection  herewith at the
request  or with  the  approval  of the  Lenders  or the  Required  Lenders,  as
applicable;  (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence
or willful misconduct;  or (iii) the due execution,  effectiveness,  validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument  related to any Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Application.  The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any  beneficiary  or  transferee  with respect to its use of any
Letter of Credit;  provided,  however,  that this assumption is not intended to,
and shall not,  preclude the Borrower's  pursuing such rights and remedies as it
may have  against  the  beneficiary  or  transferee  at law or under  any  other
agreement.  None of the Issuing Lender, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the
respective  correspondents,  participants  or assignees  of the Issuing  Lender,
shall be liable or responsible  for any of the matters  described in clauses (i)
through (iv) of Section 2.2(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses
to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the  Borrower  may have a claim  against the
Issuing  Lender,  and the Issuing  Lender may be liable to the Borrower,  to the
extent,  but only to the extent,  of any direct,  as opposed to consequential or
exemplary,  damages  suffered by the  Borrower  which the  Borrower  proves were
caused by the Issuing  Lender's  willful  misconduct or gross  negligence or the
Issuing  Lender's  willful  failure to pay under any Letter of Credit  after the
presentation  to it by the  beneficiary  of a  sight  draft  and  certificate(s)
strictly  complying  with the terms and  conditions  of a Letter of  Credit.  In
furtherance  and not in  limitation  of the  foregoing,  the Issuing  Lender may
accept   documents   that  appear  on  their  face  to  be  in  order,   without
responsibility   for  further   investigation,   regardless  of  any  notice  or
information to the contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for
the  validity or  sufficiency  of any  instrument  transferring  or assigning or
purporting  to  transfer  or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder  or  proceeds  thereof,  in whole or in part,  which  may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g) Cash Collateral.  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i)
if the Issuing Lender has honored any full or partial  drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an LOC Borrowing,  or (ii) if,
as of the  Letter of Credit  Expiration  Date,  any Letter of Credit may for any
reason remain  outstanding and partially or wholly  undrawn,  the Borrower shall
immediately Cash Collateralize the aggregate  outstanding LOC Obligations (in an
amount  equal  to such  LOC  Obligations  determined  as of the date of such LOC
Borrowing  or the Letter of Credit  Expiration  Date,  as the case may be).  For
purposes  hereof,  "Cash  Collateralize"  means to pledge  and  deposit  with or
deliver to the  Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and
the Lenders,  as collateral  for the LOC  Obligations,  cash or deposit  account
balances  pursuant to  documentation  in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Administrative  Agent  and  the  Issuing  Lender  (which  documents  are  hereby
consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of the term "Cash Collateralize" shall
have  corresponding  meanings.  The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative
Agent,  for the  benefit  of the  Issuing  Lender  and the  Lenders,  a security
interest in all such cash,  deposit  accounts and all  balances  therein and all
proceeds of the  foregoing.  Cash  collateral  shall be  maintained  in blocked,
interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.

         (h)  Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise  expressly agreed
by the Issuing  Lender and the Borrower  when a Letter of Credit is issued,  the
rules of the  "International  Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute
of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be
in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit.

         (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the  account of each  Lender in  accordance  with its Pro Rata Share a
Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit  equal to the  Applicable  Margin
times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
(whether  or not such  maximum  amount is then in effect  under  such  Letter of
Credit).  Such letter of credit  fees shall be computed on a quarterly  basis in
arrears.  Such  letter  of credit  fees  shall be due and  payable  on the first
Business  Day  after  the end of  each  March,  June,  September  and  December,
commencing  with the first such date to occur after the  issuance of such Letter
of Credit,  on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If
there is any  change in the  Applicable  Margin  during any  quarter,  the daily
maximum  amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the
Applicable  Margin  separately  for each period  during such  quarter  that such
Applicable Margin was in effect.

         (j) Fronting Fee and  Documentary  and  Processing  Charges  Payable to
Issuing  Lender.  The Borrower  shall pay directly to the Issuing Lender for its
own  account a fronting  fee with  respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount
equal to the greater of (A) $1,250 and (B)  one-eighth  of one percent  (0.125%)
times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
(whether  or not such  maximum  amount is then in effect  under  such  Letter of
Credit)  (which  fronting fee shall be payable  quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each March,  June,  September  and December for the  immediately
preceding quarter (or a portion thereof)).  In addition,  the Borrower shall pay
directly to the  Issuing  Lender for its own  account  the  customary  issuance,
presentation,  amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and
charges,  of the  Issuing  Lender  relating to letters of credit as from time to
time in effect.  Such  customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and
payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

         (k)  Conflict  with Letter of Credit  Application.  In the event of any
conflict  between  the  terms  hereof  and the  terms of any  Letter  of  Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.



                                   ARTICLE III

                            GENERAL CREDIT PROVISIONS

Section 3.1 Default Rate.

         Upon  the  occurrence,  and  during  the  continuance,  of an  Event of
Default,  (i) the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law,  interest on
the Loans (once past due) and any other  amounts  owing  hereunder  or under the
other Credit  Documents shall bear interest,  payable on demand,  at a per annum
rate 2% greater than the rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate
is applicable,  whether in respect of interest,  fees or other amounts, then the
Default Rate) and (ii) the Letter of Credit Fee shall accrue at a per annum rate
2% greater than the rate which would otherwise be applicable.

Section 3.2 Prepayments.

         (a)  Voluntary.  Subject to Section 3.14 and the  mandatory  prepayment
provisions  set forth in Section  3.2(b),  the Borrower may prepay any Revolving
Loans at any time  without  premium  or  penalty.  The  Borrower  shall give the
Administrative  Agent at least 3  Business  Days  prior  written  notice  of the
prepayment  of any  Eurodollar  Loan and at least 1 Business  Day prior  written
notice of the  prepayment of any Base Rate Loan,  provided,  however,  that each
partial prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000
and  integral  multiples of $500,000 in excess  thereof  (or, if less,  the then
remaining principal balance of the Revolving Loans).

         (b) Mandatory Prepayments.

              (i) (A) Revolving  Committed  Amount.  If, at any time,  the Total
         Outstandings  shall  exceed the lesser of (x) the  Revolving  Committed
         Amount and (y) the  Borrowing  Base Amount for such date,  the Borrower
         shall  immediately make payment on the Loans and/or Cash  Collateralize
         the LOC Obligations in an amount equal to such excess.

                   (B) LOC  Committed  Amount.  If, at any time,  the  aggregate
         principal  amount of LOC  Obligations  shall  exceed the LOC  Committed
         Amount,  the  Borrower  immediately  shall Cash  Collateralize  the LOC
         Obligations in an amount equal to such excess.

              (ii) Prepayments From Casualty and Condemnation Events. Subject to
         the rights of tenants under any applicable lease,  immediately upon the
         occurrence of any event requiring application of any insurance proceeds
         to the prepayment of the Obligations  pursuant to Section  7.6(b),  the
         Borrower shall prepay the Loans in the amount  required by such Section
         7.6(b).  Amounts prepaid  pursuant to this Section  3.2(b)(ii) shall be
         applied  first,  to the  Revolving  Loans  and  second  (and  after all
         Revolving  Loans  have  been  paid)  to  Cash   Collateralize  the  LOC
         Obligations  in an  amount  equal to the then  outstanding  Letters  of
         Credit.

         (c) Terms of Prepayments. Within the parameters of the applications set
forth above, all prepayments  shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then
to  Eurodollar  Loans  in  direct  order  of  Interest  Period  maturities.  All
prepayments  under this  Section  3.2(b) shall be subject to Section  3.14.  All
prepayments  made  pursuant to this  Section 3.2 shall  include any interest due
with  respect to any amount of the  Obligations  being  prepaid.  Promptly  upon
receipt  of  any  notice  of  prepayment  pursuant  to  this  Section  3.2,  the
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to each Lender.

Section 3.3 Continuation.

         So long as no Event of Default  shall have  occurred and be  continuing
and to the extent permitted in the definition of the term "Interest Period", the
Borrower may on any Business Day, with respect to any Eurodollar  Loan, elect to
maintain such  Eurodollar  Loan or any portion  thereof as a Eurodollar  Loan by
selecting a new  Interest  Period for such  Eurodollar  Loan.  Each new Interest
Period  selected  under this  Section 3.3 shall  commence on the last day of the
immediately  preceding Interest Period.  Each selection of a new Interest Period
shall be made by the Borrower giving to the  Administrative  Agent a Loan Notice
not later  than 11:00 A.M.  on the third  Business  Day prior to the date of any
such  Continuation.  Such notice by the Borrower of a  Continuation  shall be by
telephone or telecopy,  confirmed immediately in writing if by telephone, in the
form  of  a  Loan  Notice,   (a)  specifying  (i)  the  proposed  date  of  such
Continuation,  (ii) the  Eurodollar  Loan and  portion  thereof  subject to such
Continuation  and (iii) the duration of the  selected  Interest  Period,  all of
which  shall be  specified  in such  manner as is  necessary  to comply with all
limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder and (b) containing  certifications of
the Borrower with respect to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 clauses (b)
through (d) as set forth in Exhibit C. Each Loan Notice shall be  irrevocable by
and binding on the Borrower once given. Promptly after receipt of a Loan Notice,
the  Administrative  Agent shall notify each Lender by telecopy or other similar
form of transmission of the proposed Continuation. If the Borrower shall fail to
select in a timely  manner a new  Interest  Period  for any  Eurodollar  Loan in
accordance with this Section 3.3, such Loan will automatically,  on the last day
of  the  current  Interest  Period  therefor,  Convert  into a  Base  Rate  Loan
notwithstanding failure of the Borrower to comply with Section 3.4.

Section 3.4 Conversion.

         So long as no Default or Event of Default  shall have  occurred  and be
continuing,  the Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrower's giving of
a Loan Notice to the Administrative Agent, Convert all or a portion of a Loan of
one Type into a Loan of another Type. Any Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan into a
Base Rate Loan shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period
for such  Eurodollar  Loan  and,  upon  Conversion  of a Base  Rate  Loan into a
Eurodollar  Loan,  the  Borrower  shall  pay  accrued  interest  to the  date of
Conversion on the principal amount so Converted.  Each such Loan Notice shall be
given not later  than 12:00  noon on the  Business  Day prior to the date of any
proposed  Conversion into Base Rate Loans and on the third Business Day prior to
the date of any  proposed  Conversion  into  Eurodollar  Loans.  Promptly  after
receipt of a Loan Notice, the  Administrative  Agent shall notify each Lender by
telecopy or other  similar  form of  transmission  of the  proposed  Conversion.
Subject  to the  restrictions  specified  above,  each Loan  Notice  shall be by
telephone  (confirmed  immediately in writing) or telecopy in the form of a Loan
Notice (a) specifying (i) the requested date of such  Conversion,  (ii) the Type
of Loan to be Converted, (iii) the portion of such Type of Loan to be Converted,
(iv)  the  Type  of  Loan  such  Loan is to be  Converted  into  and (v) if such
Conversion is into a Eurodollar  Loan,  the  requested  duration of the Interest
Period of such Loan,  and (b)  containing  certifications  of the Borrower  with
respect to the  conditions  set forth in Section  5.2 clauses (b) through (d) as
set forth in Exhibit C. Each Loan Notice shall be  irrevocable by and binding on
the Borrower once given.

Section 3.5 Extension of Maturity Date.

         The  Borrower  shall  have  the  right,  upon  written  notice  to  the
Administrative  Agent (which the Administrative Agent will distribute to each of
the  Lenders)  (the  "Extension  Notice") not earlier than 90 days and not later
than 60 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect (the  "Existing  Maturity
Date") to extend the  Existing  Maturity  Date for one  additional  one (1) year
period (the "Requested  Maturity Date") (provided that if the Requested Maturity
Date is not a  Business  Day,  then such  Requested  Maturity  Date shall be the
immediately  preceding  Business Day);  subject,  however,  in any such case, to
satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

         (a) no Event of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing  (i) on
the date on which such  Extension  Notice is delivered  and (ii) during any time
following  the date of delivery of such  Extension  Notice and the Maturity Date
then in effect;

         (b) the  representations  and  warranties  set forth in Article VI this
Credit Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
the date on which such maturity extension is to become effective;

         (c) on or before the Existing Maturity Date, the  Administrative  Agent
shall  have  received,  on behalf of each of the  Lenders,  updated  appraisals,
commissioned,  reviewed and approved by the Administrative Agent with respect to
each Borrowing Base Asset; and

         (d) on or before the Existing Maturity Date, the  Administrative  Agent
shall have  received,  on behalf of each of the Lenders,  a fee in the amount of
0.30% on the Revolving  Committed  Amount as of the date on which such Extension
Notice was delivered,  such fee to be allocated to the Lenders according to each
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Committed Amount.

Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  in this  Section 3.5, the
Maturity  Date may not be  extended  for more than one  additional  one (1) year
period.

Section 3.6 Termination, Reduction and Increase of Revolving Committed Amount.

         (a)  Voluntary   Reductions.   The  Borrower  may  from  time  to  time
permanently  reduce or terminate the Revolving  Committed  Amount in whole or in
part (in minimum  aggregate  amounts of $10,000,000 or in integral  multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the full remaining amount of the then
applicable  Revolving  Committed Amount)) upon five Business Days' prior written
notice  to  the  Administrative   Agent  (and  the  Administrative  Agent  shall
disseminate  such  information  to the  Lenders);  provided,  however,  no  such
termination or reduction shall be made which would cause the Total  Outstandings
to exceed the lesser of (i) the Revolving Committed Amount and (y) the Borrowing
Base Amount,  unless,  concurrently  with such  termination  or  reduction,  the
Revolving Loans are repaid to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The
Administrative  Agent shall promptly  notify each affected  Lender of receipt by
the  Administrative  Agent of any  notice  from the  Borrower  pursuant  to this
Section 3.6(a).  Any notices  provided by the Borrower  pursuant to this Section
3.6(a) shall be irrevocable  once given and shall be effective only upon receipt
of the same by the Administrative Agent.

         (b) Increase in Revolving Committed Amount.

              (i) The  Borrower  shall  have the  right,  upon at least ten (10)
         Business  Days' prior written notice to the  Administrative  Agent (and
         the Administrative  Agent shall disseminate notice to the Lenders),  to
         request an increase of the Revolving  Committed  Amount hereunder to an
         aggregate amount of not more than  $125,000,000 at any time on or after
         the Closing Date and prior to the Maturity Date,  subject,  however, in
         any such case, to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

                   (A) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
              continuing on the date on which such  Revolving  Committed  Amount
              increase is to become effective;

                   (B) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6
              of this Credit Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
              respects on and as of the date on which such increase is to become
              effective;

                   (C) on or before the date on which such increase is to become
              effective,  the Administrative Agent shall have received,  for its
              own account, the mutually acceptable fees and expenses required by
              separate agreement of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to
              be paid in connection with such increase;

                   (D) such  requested  increase shall be effective on such date
              only  to  the  extent   that,   on  or  before   such  date,   the
              Administrative Agent shall have received and accepted from (x) one
              or  more  Lenders  hereunder  or  (y)  with  respect  any  lender,
              reasonably   acceptable  to  the  Administrative   Agent  and  the
              Borrower,  that  is  not  at  such  time a  Lender  hereunder,  an
              agreement in the form of Exhibit J hereto  (each such  agreement a
              "New  Commitment  Agreement"),  with  respect  to  the  Additional
              Revolving Commitment of such Lender.

              (ii)  Upon the  effectiveness  of the  increase  in the  Revolving
         Committed Amount pursuant to subsection (i), the Commitment  Percentage
         of each Lender shall be  automatically  adjusted to give effect to such
         increase,  provided,  that with  respect to each  Lender  (other than a
         Lender  whose  Revolving   Commitment  shall  have  been  increased  in
         connection with such increase in the Revolving  Committed Amount),  (i)
         the  product of the Pro Rata  Share of each  Lender  multiplied  by the
         Revolving  Committed  Amount for each Lender prior to giving  effect to
         such  adjustment,  shall be equal to (ii) the  product  of the Pro Rata
         Share of each Lender  multiplied by the Revolving  Committed Amount for
         each such Lender, after giving effect to such adjustment.

              (iii) If and when any  adjustment is made to the Pro Rata Share of
         any Lender  pursuant to subsection  (ii) at any time when any Revolving
         Loans are outstanding,  the Borrower,  the Administrative Agent and the
         Lenders  will use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to assign and
         assume  outstanding  Revolving Loans to conform the respective  amounts
         thereof  held by each  Lender to the  respective  Pro Rata  Share as so
         adjusted,  it  being  understood  that the  parties  hereto  shall  use
         commercially  reasonable  efforts to avoid  prepayment or assignment of
         any  Revolving  Loan that is a Eurodollar  Loan on a day other than the
         last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

         (c) Maturity Date. Unless terminated sooner pursuant to Sections 9.2 or
3.6, the  Revolving  Commitments  of the Lenders and the LOC  Commitment  of the
Issuing Lender shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

         (d) General. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders in accordance  with the terms of Section  3.7(a),  on the
date of each  termination or reduction of the Revolving  Committed  Amount,  the
Unused Fee accrued  through the date of such  termination  or  reduction  on the
amount of the Revolving Committed Amount so terminated or reduced. The Revolving
Commitments,  once terminated or reduced may not be increased or reinstated. Any
reduction in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments shall result in a
proportionate  reduction  (rounded  to the  next  lowest  integral  multiple  of
$100,000) in the LOC  Committed  Amount;  provided,  however,  the LOC Committed
Amount shall not be reduced by operation of this sentence to an amount less than
the LOC Obligations at such time.

Section 3.7 Fees.

         (a) Unused Fee. In  consideration  of the Revolving  Commitments of the
Lenders hereunder,  the Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each  Lender a fee (the  "Unused  Fee") equal to (i)  twenty-five
basis points (0.25%) per annum times the Unused  Revolving  Committed Amount for
each day on which the Usage Percentage  exceeds 50% and (ii)  thirty-five  basis
points (0.35%) per annum times the Unused  Revolving  Committed  Amount for each
day on which the Usage  Percentage  is equal to or less than 50%. The Unused Fee
shall  commence  to accrue on the  Closing  Date and shall be due and payable in
arrears on the last  Business Day of each March,  June,  September  and December
(and on any date  that the  Revolving  Committed  Amount is  reduced  and on the
Maturity Date) for the immediately  preceding quarter (or portion thereof) (each
such  quarter or portion  thereof for which the Unused Fee is payable  hereunder
being herein referred to as an "Unused Fee Calculation Period"),  beginning with
the first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date.

         (b) Agent's Fees.  The Borrower  promises to pay to the  Administrative
Agent,  for its own account,  for the account of the Issuing  Lender and for the
account of Banc of America  Securities LLC, as applicable,  the fees referred to
in the Agent's Fee Letter.

Section 3.8 Capital Adequacy.

         If any Lender has determined,  after the date hereof, that the adoption
or  the  becoming  effective  of,  or  any  change  in,  or  any  change  by any
Governmental  Authority,  central  bank or  comparable  agency  charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any  applicable  Law,  rule or regulation  regarding  capital  adequacy,  or
compliance  by such  Lender  with any  request or  directive  regarding  capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable  agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
obligations  hereunder  to a level  below  that  which  such  Lender  could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration  such Lender's policies with respect to capital  adequacy),  then,
upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to
pay to such Lender such  additional  amount or amounts as will  compensate  such
Lender for such  reduction.  Each  determination  by any such  Lender of amounts
owing under this Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding
on the parties hereto.

Section 3.9 Limitation on Eurodollar Loans.

         If on or  prior  to the  first  day  of any  Interest  Period  for  any
Eurodollar Loan:

         (a) the Administrative  Agent determines (which  determination shall be
conclusive)  that by reason of  circumstances  affecting  the  relevant  market,
adequate and reasonable  means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate
for such Interest Period; or

         (b) the  Required  Lenders  determine  (which  determination  shall  be
conclusive)  and notify the  Administrative  Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will
not  adequately  and fairly  reflect  the cost to any of the  Lenders of funding
Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and
so long as such  condition  remains in  effect,  the  Lenders  shall be under no
obligation to make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to
Convert Base Rate Loans into  Eurodollar  Loans and the Borrower  shall,  on the
last  day(s)  of  the  then  current  Interest  Period(s)  for  the  outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Eurodollar Loans or Convert such Eurodollar
Loans  into  Base  Rate  Loans  in  accordance  with the  terms  of this  Credit
Agreement.

Section 3.10 Illegality.

         Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Credit  Agreement,  in the
event  that  it  becomes  unlawful  for any  Lender  or its  Applicable  Lending
Office(s) to make,  maintain,  or fund  Eurodollar  Loans  hereunder,  then such
Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower  thereof and such Lender's  obligation
to make or  Continue  Eurodollar  Loans  and to  Convert  Base Rate  Loans  into
Eurodollar  Loans  shall be  suspended  until such time as such Lender may again
make,  maintain,  and fund  Eurodollar  Loans (in which case the  provisions  of
Section 3.12 shall be applicable).

Section 3.11 Change of Law.

         If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable Law, rule, or
regulation,  or any change in any applicable  Law,  rule, or regulation,  or any
change in the  interpretation  or  administration  thereof  by any  Governmental
Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or their Applicable Lending
Office(s))  with any  request or  directive  (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

              (i) shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable  Lending  Office)
         to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans,
         its Revolving  Notes,  or its obligation to make  Eurodollar  Loans, or
         change the basis of taxation of any amounts  payable to such Lender (or
         its  Applicable  Lending  Office)  under this Credit  Agreement  or its
         Revolving  Notes in respect of any  Eurodollar  Loans (other than taxes
         imposed on the overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in
         which such Lender has its principal  office or such Applicable  Lending
         Office);

              (ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit,  assessment, or similar requirement relating to any extensions
         of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities
         or  commitments  of, such Lender (or its  Applicable  Lending  Office),
         including the Revolving Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or

              (iii)  shall  impose on such  Lender  (or its  Applicable  Lending
         Office) or the London  interbank  market any other condition  affecting
         this Credit  Agreement or its Revolving Notes or any of such extensions
         of credit or liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase  the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making,  Converting into,  Continuing,  or
maintaining any Eurodollar  Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable  Lending  Office) under this Credit  Agreement or
its  Revolving  Notes with respect to any  Eurodollar  Loans,  then the Borrower
shall pay to such  Lender on demand  such  amount or amounts as will  compensate
such  Lender  for such  increased  cost or  reduction.  If any  Lender  requests
compensation  by the Borrower  under this  Section  3.11,  the Borrower  may, by
notice to such Lender  (with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent),  suspend the
obligation of such Lender to make or Continue  Eurodollar  Loans,  or to Convert
Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans,  until the event or condition giving rise
to such request  ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section
3.12 shall be applicable);  provided that such  suspension  shall not affect the
right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. Each Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent of any event of which
it has  knowledge,  occurring  after the date  hereof,  which will  entitle such
Lender to  compensation  pursuant  to this  Section  3.11 and will  designate  a
different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for,
or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
Lender,  be otherwise  disadvantageous  to it. Any Lender claiming  compensation
under this  Section 3.11 shall  furnish to the  Borrower and the  Administrative
Agent a statement  setting forth the additional  amount or amounts to be paid to
it hereunder  which shall be  conclusive  in the absence of manifest  error.  In
determining  such  amount,  such  Lender may use any  reasonable  averaging  and
attribution methods.

Section 3.12 Treatment of Affected Loans.

         If the  obligation  of any  Lender  to make any  Eurodollar  Loan or to
Continue,  or to  Convert  Base  Rate  Loans  into,  Eurodollar  Loans  shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar
Loans shall be  automatically  Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s)
of the then current  Interest  Period(s) for such  Eurodollar  Loans (or, in the
case of a  Conversion,  on such  earlier  date as such Lender may specify to the
Borrower  with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent) and,  unless and until such
Lender  gives  notice as  provided  below that the  circumstances  specified  in
Section  3.9,  3.10 or 3.11 hereof that gave rise to such  Conversion  no longer
exist:

         (a) to the  extent  that such  Lender's  Eurodollar  Loans have been so
Converted,  all payments and  prepayments of principal  that would  otherwise be
applied to such Lender's  Eurodollar  Loans shall be applied instead to its Base
Rate Loans; and

         (b) all Loans that would  otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender
as Eurodollar  Loans shall be made or Continued  instead as Base Rate Loans, and
all Base Rate  Loans of such  Lender  that would  otherwise  be  Converted  into
Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower  (with a copy to the  Administrative
Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11 hereof that
gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender's  Eurodollar  Loans pursuant to this
Section 3.12 no longer exist (which such Lender  agrees to do promptly upon such
circumstances  ceasing to exist) at a time when  Eurodollar  Loans made by other
Lenders are  outstanding,  such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be  automatically
Converted,  on the first day(s) of the next  succeeding  Interest  Period(s) for
such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving
effect thereto,  all Loans held by the Lenders Parties holding  Eurodollar Loans
and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to  principal  amounts,  interest  rate
basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their Revolving Commitments.

Section 3.13 Taxes.

         (a) Any and all  payments by any Credit  Party to or for the account of
any  Lender or the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  or under any other  Credit
Document  shall be made free and clear of and without  deduction for any and all
present  or future  taxes,  duties,  levies,  imposts,  deductions,  charges  or
withholdings,  and all liabilities with respect thereto,  excluding, in the case
of each Lender and the  Administrative  Agent,  taxes imposed on its income, and
franchise  taxes imposed on it (all such  non-excluded  taxes,  duties,  levies,
imposts, deductions,  charges,  withholdings,  and liabilities being hereinafter
referred to as "Taxes").  If any Credit Party shall be required by law to deduct
any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable  under this Credit  Agreement or
any other Credit Document to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum
payable  shall be  increased  as  necessary  so that after  making all  required
deductions  (including  deductions  applicable to additional  sums payable under
this Section 3.13) such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent  receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such  deductions  been made, (ii)
such Credit Party shall make such deductions,  (iii) such Credit Party shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant  taxation  authority or other authority
in accordance  with  applicable Law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall furnish to
the  Administrative  Agent,  at its  address  referred to in Section  11.2,  the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

         (b) In  addition,  the  Borrower  agrees to pay any and all  present or
future  stamp or  documentary  taxes and any other  excise or property  taxes or
charges or similar  levies  which arise from any payment  made under this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit  Document or from the execution or delivery of, or
otherwise  with respect to, this Credit  Agreement or any other Credit  Document
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative
Agent  for the  full  amount  of  Taxes  and  Other  Taxes  (including,  without
limitation,  any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on
amounts   payable   under  this  Section  3.13)  paid  by  such  Lender  or  the
Administrative  Agent  (as  the  case  may  be)  and  any  liability  (including
penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.

         (d)  Each  Lender  that is not a United  States  person  under  Section
7701(a)(30)  of the Code,  on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this  Credit  Agreement  in the case of each Lender  listed on the  signature
pages  hereof  and on or prior to the date on which it  becomes  a Lender in the
case of each other  Lender,  and from time to time  thereafter  if  requested in
writing by the  Borrower or the  Administrative  Agent (but only so long as such
Lender  remains  lawfully  able to do so),  shall  provide the  Borrower and the
Administrative  Agent with (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI,
as  appropriate,  or any  successor  form  prescribed  by the  Internal  Revenue
Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax
treaty to which the United  States is a party which  reduces to zero the rate of
withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the income receivable
pursuant to this Credit Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States,  (ii) Internal  Revenue Service Form W-8
or W-9, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service,  and/or  (iii) any other  form or  certificate  required  by any taxing
authority  (including any certificate  required by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of
the Code),  certifying  that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from tax on
payments pursuant to this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

         (e) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide
the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to
Section  3.13(d)  (unless  such  failure is due to a change in treaty,  law,  or
regulation  occurring  subsequent  to the  date on which a form  originally  was
required to be provided),  such Lender shall not be entitled to  indemnification
under  Section  3.13(a) or 3.13(b) with  respect to Taxes  imposed by the United
States; provided,  however, that should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from
withholding  tax,  become  subject to Taxes  because of its failure to deliver a
form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall
reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

         (f) If any Credit Party is required to pay additional amounts to or for
the account of any Lender  pursuant to this Section 3.13,  then such Lender will
agree to use  reasonable  efforts to change the  jurisdiction  of its Applicable
Lending  Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such  additional  payment which
may  thereafter  accrue if such change,  in the judgment of such Lender,  is not
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender, as applicable.

         (g) Without  prejudice  to the  survival of any other  agreement of the
Credit Parties  hereunder,  the agreements and obligations of the Credit Parties
contained  in this  Section  3.13 shall  survive the  repayment of the Loans and
other  obligations  under  the  Credit  Documents  and  the  termination  of the
Revolving Commitments hereunder.

Section 3.14 Compensation.

         Upon the request of any Lender,  the Borrower  shall pay to such Lender
such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Lender) to  compensate  it for any loss,  cost,  or expense  (excluding  loss of
anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

         (a) any payment, prepayment, or Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan for any
reason on a date other than the last day of the  Interest  Period for such Loan;
or

         (b) any  failure by the  Borrower  for any reason  (including,  without
limitation,  the failure of any condition precedent specified in Article V to be
satisfied) to borrow, Convert, Continue, or prepay a Eurodollar Loan on the date
for such borrowing,  Conversion,  Continuation,  or prepayment  specified in the
relevant Loan Notice or prepayment notice under this Credit Agreement.

With respect to Eurodollar  Loans,  such  indemnification  may include an amount
equal to the  excess,  if any,  of (a) the amount of  interest  which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid,  or not so borrowed,  Converted or  Continued,
for the period from the date of such  prepayment  or of such  failure to borrow,
Convert or Continue to the last day of the  applicable  Interest  Period (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow,  Convert or Continue,  the Interest Period that
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable
rate of interest  for such  Eurodollar  Loans  provided  for herein  (excluding,
however,  the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (b) the amount of
interest (as  reasonably  determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to
such  Lender on such amount by placing  such amount on deposit for a  comparable
period with leading banks in the interbank  Eurodollar  market. The covenants of
the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.14 shall  survive the  repayment of the
Loans, LOC Obligations and other  obligations under the Credit Documents and the
termination of the Revolving Commitments hereunder.

Section 3.15 Pro Rata Treatment.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

         (a) Loans. Each Revolving Loan, as between the Lenders, each payment or
(subject to the terms of Section 3.2)  prepayment  of principal of any Revolving
Loan, as between the Lenders, or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings
under  Letters of Credit,  each payment of interest on the  Revolving  Loan,  as
between the Lenders,  or reimbursement  obligations  arising from drawings under
Letters of Credit,  each payment of Unused  Fees,  each payment of the Letter of
Credit Fee, each reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion
or  extension  of any Loan,  shall be  allocated  pro rata among the  Lenders in
accordance with the respective  principal  amounts of their outstanding Loans of
the applicable type and Participation  Interests in Loans of the applicable type
and Letters of Credit.

         (b) Advances.  No Lender shall be responsible  for the failure or delay
by any other Lender in its  obligation  to make its ratable share of a borrowing
hereunder;  provided,  however,  that the  failure of any Lender to fulfill  its
obligations  hereunder  shall not  relieve any other  Lender of its  obligations
hereunder.  Unless the  Administrative  Agent  shall have been  notified  by any
Lender prior to the date of any  requested  borrowing  that such Lender does not
intend to make available to the  Administrative  Agent its ratable share of such
borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of
such borrowing,  and the Administrative  Agent in reliance upon such assumption,
may (in its sole  discretion but without any obligation to do so) make available
to the Borrower a corresponding  amount. If such corresponding  amount is not in
fact made available to the Administrative  Agent, the Administrative Agent shall
be able to recover such  corresponding  amount from such Lender.  If such Lender
does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and
the  Borrower  shall   immediately   pay  such   corresponding   amount  to  the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover
from  the  Lender  or the  Borrower,  as the  case  may  be,  interest  on  such
corresponding  amount in  respect  of each day from the date such  corresponding
amount was made  available  by the  Administrative  Agent to the Borrower to the
date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per
annum  rate  equal to (i)  from  the  Borrower  at the  applicable  rate for the
applicable  borrowing  pursuant to the Loan Notice and (ii) from a Lender at the
Federal Funds Rate.

Section 3.16 Sharing of Payments.

         The Lenders agree among  themselves  that, in the event that any Lender
shall  obtain  payment  in  respect of any Loan,  LOC  Obligations  or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff,  banker's lien or  counterclaim,  or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other  security
or interest  arising from, or in lieu of, such secured  claim,  received by such
Lender  under any  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or other  similar law or
otherwise,  or by any  other  means,  in  excess  of its pro rata  share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit  Agreement,  such Lender  shall  promptly
purchase  from the other  Lenders a  Participation  Interest in such Loans,  LOC
Obligations  and  other  obligations  in  such  amounts,  and  make  such  other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share  such  payment  in  accordance  with their  respective  ratable  shares as
provided  for  in  this  Credit  Agreement.  The  Lenders  further  agree  among
themselves  that if payment to a Lender  obtained  by such  Lender  through  the
exercise of a right of setoff,  banker's  lien,  counterclaim  or other event as
aforesaid  shall be rescinded or must  otherwise be restored,  each Lender which
shall have  shared  the  benefit  of such  payment  shall,  by  repurchase  of a
Participation  Interest  theretofore  sold,  return  its  share of that  benefit
(together with its share of any accrued  interest  payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose  payment shall have been  rescinded or otherwise  restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation  Interest
may, to the fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  exercise  all rights of payment
(including  the right of setoff,  but subject to Section  11.9) with  respect to
such  Participation  Interest  as fully as if such  Lender were a holder of such
Loan, LOC  Obligations or other  obligation in the amount of such  Participation
Interest.  Except as otherwise  expressly provided in this Credit Agreement,  if
any Lender shall fail to remit to the  Administrative  Agent or any other Lender
an amount  payable  by such  Lender to the  Administrative  Agent or such  other
Lender  pursuant to this Credit  Agreement  on the date when such amount is due,
such payments  shall be made  together with interest  thereon for each date from
the  date  such  amount  is due  until  the  date  such  amount  is  paid to the
Administrative  Agent or such  other  Lender  at a rate per  annum  equal to the
Federal  Funds Rate.  If under any  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency or other
similar  law, any Lender  receives a secured  claim in lieu of a setoff to which
this  Section  3.16  applies,  such  Lender  shall,  to the extent  practicable,
exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with
the rights of the Lenders  under this  Section  3.16 to share in the benefits of
any recovery on such secured claim.

Section 3.17 Payments, Computations, Etc.

         (a) Generally.  Except as otherwise  specifically  provided herein, all
payments  hereunder  shall be made to the  Administrative  Agent in  Dollars  in
immediately  available  funds,  without  setoff,   deduction,   counterclaim  or
withholding  of any kind, at the  Administrative  Agent's  Office not later than
2:00 P.M.  on the date when due.  Payments  received  after  such time  shall be
deemed  to  have  been  received  on  the  next  succeeding  Business  Day.  The
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any
such payment which is not made by such time to any ordinary  deposit  account of
the Borrower or any other Credit Party maintained with the Administrative  Agent
(with notice to the Borrower or such other Credit Party). The Borrower shall, at
the time it makes any  payment  under  this  Credit  Agreement,  specify  to the
Administrative Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest or other amounts
payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in
the  event  that it  fails  so to  specify,  or if  such  application  would  be
inconsistent with the terms hereof,  the  Administrative  Agent shall distribute
such  payment to the  Lenders  in such  manner as the  Administrative  Agent may
determine  to be  appropriate  in respect of  obligations  owing by the Borrower
hereunder,  subject to the terms of Section 3.15(a)).  The Administrative  Agent
will  distribute  such payments to such Lender,  if any such payment is received
prior to 2:00 P.M. on a Business Day in like funds as received  prior to the end
of such Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute such
payment to such Lender on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment
hereunder  shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business  Day,  the
due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding  Business Day (subject
to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such  extension),  except that
in the case of Eurodollar  Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be
made in the next following  calendar  month,  then such payment shall instead be
made on the next preceding  Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise
herein,  all  computations  of  interest  and fees shall be made on the basis of
actual  number of days elapsed  over a year of 360 days,  except with respect to
computation  of  interest  on Base  Rate  Loans at times  when the Base  Rate is
determined by Bank of America's  "prime rate" which shall be calculated based on
a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. Interest
shall  accrue from and include  the date of  borrowing,  but exclude the date of
payment.

         (b)  Allocation  of  Payments   After  Event  of  Default.   After  the
acceleration  of the Obligations as provided for in Section 9.2(b) (or after the
Loans  have  automatically  become  immediately  due  and  payable  and  the LOC
Obligations have  automatically  been required to be Cash  Collateralized as set
forth in Section  9.2(c),  any amounts  received  on account of the  Obligations
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:

              FIRST,   to  the  payment  of  that  portion  of  the  Obligations
         constituting fees,  indemnities,  expenses and other amounts (including
         without   limitation   reasonable   attorneys'  fees)  payable  to  the
         Administrative Agent in its capacity as such;

              SECOND,  to  the  payment  of  that  portion  of  the  Obligations
         constituting fees,  indemnities and other amounts (other than principal
         and interest)  payable to the Lenders  (including  without  limitation,
         reasonable  attorneys'  fees)  ratably  among them in proportion to the
         amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;

              THIRD, to payment of that portion of the Obligations  constituting
         accrued and unpaid interest on the Revolving Loans and LOC Obligations,
         ratably  among the  Lenders in  proportion  to the  respective  amounts
         described in this clause Third payable to them;

              FOURTH, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
         unpaid  principal of the Revolving  Loans,  LOC Obligations and to Cash
         Collateralize  the undrawn amounts of Letters of Credit,  ratably among
         the Lenders in proportion to the respective  amounts  described in this
         clause Fourth held by them;

              LAST, the balance,  if any, after all of the Obligations have been
         indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise  required by
         Law.

         Subject to  Section  2.2(c),  amounts  used to Cash  Collateralize  the
aggregate  undrawn  amount of Letters of Credit  pursuant to clause Fourth above
shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur.
If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral  after all Letters of Credit
have either been fully drawn or expired,  such remaining amount shall be applied
to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

Section 3.18 Evidence of Indebtedness.

         (a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts  evidencing  each
Loan  made by such  Lender to the  Borrower  from  time to time,  including  the
amounts of principal  and interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Credit  Agreement.  Each Lender will make reasonable  efforts to
maintain  the  accuracy of its account or  accounts  and to promptly  update its
account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.

         (b) The  Administrative  Agent shall maintain the Register  pursuant to
Section  11.7(c),  and a  subaccount  for each  Lender,  in which  Register  and
subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest
Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender  hereunder and (iii)
the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for
the  account  of  any  Credit  Party  and  each  Lender's  share  thereof.   The
Administrative  Agent will make  reasonable  efforts to maintain the accuracy of
the  subaccounts  referred to in the preceding  sentence and to promptly  update
such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.

         (c)  The  entries  made  in  the  accounts,  Register  and  subaccounts
maintained  pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 3.18 (and, if consistent with
the  entries of the  Administrative  Agent,  clause  (a))  shall be prima  facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the  obligations  of the Credit Parties
therein  recorded;  provided,  however,  that the  failure  of any Lender or the
Administrative  Agent  to  maintain  any such  account,  such  Register  or such
subaccount,  as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect
the  obligation  of the Credit  Parties to repay the  Obligations  owing to such
Lender.

Section 3.19. Usury.

         In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or
other Obligations  exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by applicable Law
and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or received by any Lender, then
such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower
shall notify the respective  Lender in writing that the Borrower  elects to have
such  excess sum  returned  to it  forthwith.  It is the  express  intent of the
parties  hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive,  directly
or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be
lawfully paid by the Borrower under applicable Law.

Section 3.20. Agreement Regarding Interest and Charges.

         The parties  hereto  hereby  agree and  stipulate  that the only charge
imposed upon the Borrower  for the use of money in  connection  with this Credit
Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in Section 2.1(d).
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the parties hereto further agree and stipulate
that all agency fees,  syndication  fees,  facility fees, letter of credit fees,
underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or "breakage" charges,
increased cost charges, attorneys' fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses
paid by the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages
incurred  by the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender,  are  charges  made  to
compensate  the  Administrative  Agent or any such  Lender for  underwriting  or
administrative  services and costs or losses  performed  or incurred,  and to be
performed or incurred, by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection
with this  Credit  Agreement  and shall under no  circumstances  be deemed to be
charges for the use of money.  Except as expressly  agreed otherwise in writing,
all charges  other than  charges for the use of money shall be fully  earned and
nonrefundable when due.

Section 3.21. Statements of Account.

         The  Administrative  Agent will account to the Borrower  monthly with a
statement of Loans,  Letters of Credit,  accrued interest and Fees,  charges and
payments made pursuant to this Credit Agreement and the other Credit  Documents,
and such  account  rendered  by the  Administrative  Agent  shall be prima facie
evidence of the amounts and other matters set forth therein.  The failure of the
Administrative  Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts  shall not relieve
or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 3.22. Defaulting Lenders.

         (a)  Generally.  If for any reason any Lender (a  "Defaulting  Lender")
shall  fail or  refuse to  perform  any of its  obligations  under  this  Credit
Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document to which it is a party within the time
period  specified for  performance  of such  obligation or, if no time period is
specified, if such failure or refusal continues for a period of two (2) Business
Days after notice from the Administrative Agent, then, in addition to the rights
and remedies that may be available to the  Administrative  Agent or the Borrower
under this Credit Agreement or applicable Law, such Defaulting Lender's right to
participate in the  administration  of the Loans,  this Credit Agreement and the
other  Credit  Documents,  including  without  limitation,  any right to vote in
respect  of,  to  consent  to or  to  direct  any  action  or  inaction  of  the
Administrative  Agent or to be taken  into  account  in the  calculation  of the
Required  Lenders,  shall be  suspended  during the  pendency of such failure or
refusal.  Upon a Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender,  the Administrative  Agent
shall  give  prompt  notice  to each  other  Lender  thereof.  If a Lender  is a
Defaulting  Lender  because  it  has  failed  to  make  timely  payment  to  the
Administrative  Agent of any amount  required  to be paid to the  Administrative
Agent  hereunder  (without  giving  effect to any  notice or cure  periods),  in
addition to other  rights and  remedies  which the  Administrative  Agent or the
Borrower may have under the immediately  preceding provisions or otherwise,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall be  entitled  (i) to  collect  interest  from  such
Defaulting  Lender on such  delinquent  payment  for the period from the date on
which the  payment  was due until the date on which the  payment  is made at the
Federal Funds Rate,  (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in  satisfaction of
the defaulted payment and any related interest, any amounts otherwise payable to
such Defaulting  Lender under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
and (iii) to bring an action or suit against such  Defaulting  Lender in a court
of  competent  jurisdiction  to recover  the  defaulted  amount and any  related
interest.  Any  amounts  received  by the  Administrative  Agent in respect of a
Defaulting  Lender's Loans shall not be paid to such Defaulting Lender and shall
be held  uninvested by the  Administrative  Agent and either applied against the
purchase price of such Loans under the following  subsection (b) or paid to such
Defaulting Lender upon the Defaulting Lender's curing of its default.

         (b) Purchase of Defaulting Lender's Commitment. Any Lender who is not a
Defaulting  Lender  shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,  in its sole
discretion,  to acquire all of a Defaulting Lender's Revolving  Commitment.  Any
Lender  desiring to exercise such right shall give written notice thereof to the
Administrative Agent no sooner than two (2) Business Days and not later than ten
(10) Business Days after such Defaulting  Lender became a Defaulting  Lender. If
more than one Lender exercises such right, each such Lender shall have the right
to  acquire  an amount  of such  Defaulting  Lender's  Revolving  Commitment  in
proportion to the Revolving  Commitments  of the other Lenders  exercising  such
right. If after such 10th Business Day, the Lenders have not elected to purchase
all of the Revolving  Commitment of such  Defaulting  Lender,  then any Eligible
Assignee may purchase  such  Revolving  Commitment.  None of the  Administrative
Agent or any of the Lenders shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any
such  replacement  or to assist in finding an Eligible  Assignee.  Upon any such
purchase, the Defaulting Lender's interest in the Loans and its rights hereunder
(but not its liability in respect thereof or under the Credit  Documents or this
Credit  Agreement  to the  extent  the same  relate to the  period  prior to the
effective date of the purchase) shall terminate on the date of purchase, and the
Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents  reasonably  requested to
surrender  and transfer such  interest to the  purchaser  thereof,  including an
appropriate   Assignment  and   Assumption   Agreement  and  shall  pay  to  the
Administrative  Agent an  assignment  fee in the amount of $3,500.  The purchase
price for the Revolving  Commitment of a Defaulting Lender shall be equal to the
amount  of the  principal  balance  of the  Loans  outstanding  and  owed by the
Borrower to the Defaulting Lender.  Prior to payment of such purchase price to a
Defaulting Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent shall apply against such purchase
price any amounts  retained  by the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant to the last
sentence of the  immediately  preceding  subsection  (a). The Defaulting  Lender
shall be entitled to receive amounts owed to it by the Borrower under the Credit
Documents  which  accrued  prior to the date of the  default  by the  Defaulting
Lender, to the extent the same are received by the Administrative  Agent from or
on behalf of the Borrower.  There shall be no recourse against any Lender or the
Administrative  Agent for the  payment of such sums  except to the extent of the
receipt of payments  from any other party or in respect of the Loans.  If, prior
to a Lender's acquisition of a Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment pursuant
to this  subsection,  such  Defaulting  Lender shall cure the event or condition
which  caused it to become a  Defaulting  Lender and shall have paid all amounts
owing by it hereunder as a result thereof, then such Lender shall no longer have
the right to acquire such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment.

Section 3.23 Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Loans.

         Calculation  of all amounts  payable to a Lender under this Article III
shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded Eurodollar Loans through
the purchase of deposits in the  relevant  market  bearing  interest at the rate
applicable  to such  Eurodollar  Loans in an amount  equal to the  amount of the
Eurodollar  Loans and  having a maturity  comparable  to the  relevant  Interest
Period;  provided,  however,  that each  Lender may fund each of its  Eurodollar
Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing  assumption shall be used only
for calculation of amounts payable under this Article III.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    GUARANTY

Section 4.1 The Guaranty.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally  guarantees to each
Lender,  each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedge Agreement,  and the
Administrative  Agent  as  hereinafter  provided,  the  prompt  payment  of  the
Obligations  in full  when due  (whether  at  stated  maturity,  as a  mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise)
strictly in accordance  with the terms thereof.  The  Guarantors  hereby further
agree that if any of the  Obligations  are not paid in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization  or otherwise),  the Guarantors  will,  jointly and severally,
promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever,  and that in the
case of any  extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the  Obligations,
the same will be promptly  paid in full when due (whether at extended  maturity,
as   a   mandatory   prepayment,   by   acceleration,   as  a   mandatory   cash
collateralization  or otherwise) in accordance  with the terms of such extension
or renewal.

         Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary  contained  herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Hedge  Agreements,  the obligations of each
Guarantor  under this Credit  Agreement and the other Credit  Documents shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render
such  obligations  subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.

Section 4.2 Obligations Unconditional.

         The  obligations  of the  Guarantors  under  Section  4.1 are joint and
several,  absolute and  unconditional,  irrespective of the value,  genuineness,
validity,  regularity or  enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Hedge
Agreements,  or any other  agreement or instrument  referred to therein,  or any
substitution,  release,  impairment  or  exchange of any other  guarantee  of or
security for any of the  Obligations,  and, to the fullest  extent  permitted by
applicable Law,  irrespective of any other  circumstance  whatsoever which might
otherwise  constitute a legal or  equitable  discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor,  it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the  obligations of the
Guarantors  hereunder  shall be  absolute  and  unconditional  under any and all
circumstances.  Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
subrogation,  indemnity,  reimbursement or contribution  against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the
Lenders (and any Affiliates of Lenders entering into Hedge Agreements) have been
paid in  full in  respect  of all  Obligations  and no  Person  or  Governmental
Authority shall have any right to request any return or  reimbursement  of funds
from the Lenders in connection with monies  received under the Credit  Documents
or Hedge Agreements between any Credit Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of
a Lender.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  it is agreed that,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the
following  shall not alter or impair the  liability of any  Guarantor  hereunder
which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:

              (a) at any  time  or from  time to  time,  without  notice  to any
         Guarantor,  the time for any  performance of or compliance  with any of
         the Obligations  shall be extended,  or such  performance or compliance
         shall be waived;

              (b) any of the acts  mentioned in any of the  provisions of any of
         the Credit Documents,  any Hedge Agreement between any Credit Party and
         any Lender,  or any  Affiliate of a Lender,  or any other  agreement or
         instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedge Agreements
         shall be done or omitted;

              (c) the maturity of any of the  Obligations  shall be accelerated,
         or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in
         any respect, or any right under any of the Credit Documents,  any Hedge
         Agreement  between any Credit Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of
         a Lender,  or any other  agreement  or  instrument  referred  to in the
         Credit  Documents or such Hedge Agreements shall be waived or any other
         guarantee of any of the  Obligations or any security  therefor shall be
         released,  impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt
         with;

              (d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative  Agent
         or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the  Obligations  shall
         fail to attach or be perfected; or

              (e)  any of the  Obligations  shall  be  determined  to be void or
         voidable  (including,  without  limitation,  for  the  benefit  of  any
         creditor of any  Guarantor) or shall be  subordinated  to the claims of
         any  Person  (including,   without  limitation,  any  creditor  of  any
         Guarantor).

With respect to its  obligations  hereunder,  each  Guarantor  hereby  expressly
waives  diligence,  presentment,  demand of  payment,  protest  and all  notices
whatsoever,  and any  requirement  that the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender
exhaust any right,  power or remedy or proceed  against any Person  under any of
the Credit  Documents,  any Hedge  Agreement  between  any Credit  Party and any
Lender,  or any  Affiliate of a Lender,  or any other  agreement  or  instrument
referred to in the Credit  Documents  or such Hedge  Agreements,  or against any
other  Person  under  any  other  guarantee  of,  or  security  for,  any of the
Obligations.

Section 4.3 Reinstatement.

         The  obligations  of the  Guarantors  under  this  Section  4 shall  be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations,  whether as a result
of any  proceedings  in bankruptcy  or  reorganization  or  otherwise,  and each
Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender
on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including,  without limitation,
fees and  expenses of  counsel)  incurred  by the  Administrative  Agent or such
Lender in connection  with such  rescission or  restoration,  including any such
costs and expenses  incurred in defending  against any claim  alleging that such
payment  constituted a preference,  fraudulent transfer or similar payment under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

Section 4.4       Certain Additional Waivers.

         Without  limiting the  generality of the  provisions of this Section 4,
each Guarantor hereby specifically waives the benefits of N.C. Gen. Stat. ss.ss.
26-7 through 26-9, inclusive,  to the extent applicable.  Each Guarantor further
agrees that such  Guarantor  shall have no right of recourse to security for the
Obligations,  except through the exercise of rights of  subrogation  pursuant to
Section  4.2 and  through the  exercise  of rights of  contribution  pursuant to
Section 4.6.

Section 4.5 Remedies.

         The Guarantors  agree that, to the fullest extent  permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors,  on the one hand, and the  Administrative  Agent and the
Lenders,  on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due
and  payable  as  provided  in Section  9.2 (and shall be deemed to have  become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2)
for  purposes  of Section  4.1  notwithstanding  any stay,  injunction  or other
prohibition  preventing such  declaration  (or preventing the  Obligations  from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in
the event of such  declaration (or the  Obligations  being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable),  the Obligations (whether or not due and payable
by any other Person) shall  forthwith  become due and payable by the  Guarantors
for  purposes of Section 4.1. The  Guarantors  acknowledge  and agree that their
obligations hereunder are secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Documents  and that the  Lenders  may  exercise  their  remedies  thereunder  in
accordance with the terms thereof.

Section 4.6 Rights of Contribution.

         The Guarantors  hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined  below),  such  Guarantor  shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's  Contribution  Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment.  The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the prior  payment in full of the  Guaranteed
Obligations, and none of the Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under
this Section 4.6 against any other Guarantor  until payment and  satisfaction in
full of all of such  Guaranteed  Obligations.  For purposes of this Section 4.6,
(a) "Guaranteed  Obligations" shall mean any obligations arising under the other
provisions of this Section 4; (b) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount paid by
any Guarantor in excess of its Ratable Share of any Guaranteed Obligations;  (c)
"Ratable  Share"  shall  mean,  for any  Guarantor  in respect of any payment of
Guaranteed Obligations,  the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of
such payment of Guaranteed  Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate
present  fair  salable  value of all of its assets and  properties  exceeds  the
amount of all debts and  liabilities  of such Guarantor  (including  contingent,
subordinated,   unmatured,  and  unliquidated  liabilities,  but  excluding  the
obligations  of such  Guarantor  hereunder)  to (ii) the  amount  by  which  the
aggregate  present fair salable value of all assets and other  properties of all
of the Credit  Parties  exceeds  the amount of all of the debts and  liabilities
(including contingent,  subordinated,  unmatured, and unliquidated  liabilities,
but excluding the  obligations  of the Credit  Parties  hereunder) of the Credit
Parties; provided,  however, that, for purposes of calculating the Ratable Share
of the  Guarantors  in respect of any  payment of  Guaranteed  Obligations,  any
Guarantor  that became a Guarantor  subsequent  to the date of any such  payment
shall be deemed to have been a  Guarantor  on the date of such  payment  and the
financial  information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a
Guarantor  shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such payment;
and (d)  "Contribution  Share" shall mean,  for any  Guarantor in respect of any
Excess  Payment  made  by  any  other  Guarantor,  the  ratio  (expressed  as  a
percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds
the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent,
subordinated,   unmatured,  and  unliquidated  liabilities,  but  excluding  the
obligations  of such  Guarantor  hereunder)  to (ii) the  amount  by  which  the
aggregate  present fair salable value of all assets and other  properties of the
Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of
all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and  unliquidated  liabilities,  but  excluding  the  obligations  of the Credit
Parties)  of the Credit  Parties  other than the maker of such  Excess  Payment;
provided,  however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of
the  Guarantors in respect of any Excess  Payment,  any Guarantor  that became a
Guarantor  subsequent to the date of any such Excess  Payment shall be deemed to
have been a  Guarantor  on the date of such  Excess  Payment  and the  financial
information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor  became a Guarantor
shall be utilized for such  Guarantor in  connection  with such Excess  Payment.
This  Section  4.6  shall not be  deemed  to  affect  any right of  subrogation,
indemnity,  reimbursement  or  contribution  that any  Guarantor  may have under
applicable  Law  against the  Borrower  in respect of any payment of  Guaranteed
Obligations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  all rights of contribution against
any  Guarantor  shall  terminate  from and after such time,  if ever,  that such
Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to Section 8.4.

Section 4.7 Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee.

         The  guarantee  in this  Section 4 is a guaranty  of payment and not of
collection,  is a  continuing  guarantee,  and  shall  apply to all  Obligations
whenever arising.

         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

         (i)  Judgments.  One or more  judgments  or  decrees  shall be  entered
against one or more of the Credit Parties involving a liability of $1,000,000 or

Section 9.2 Remedies Upon Event of Default.

         Upon the occurrence and during the  continuance of an Event of Default,
the Administrative  Agent may or, upon the request and direction of the Required
Lenders,  shall,  by  written  notice  to the  Credit  Parties  take  any of the
following actions:

         (a)  Termination  of  Commitments.  Declare the  Revolving  Commitments
terminated whereupon the Revolving Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

         (b)  Acceleration.  Declare  the unpaid  principal  of and any  accrued
interest in respect of all Loans,  any  reimbursement  obligations  arising from
drawings  under  Letters  of  Credit  and  any  and all  other  indebtedness  or
obligations  of  any  and  every  kind  owing  by  the  Credit  Parties  to  the
Administrative Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder to be due whereupon the
same shall be immediately due and payable without presentment,  demand,  protest
or other  notice  of any  kind,  all of which are  hereby  waived by the  Credit
Parties.

         (c) Cash  Collateral.  Direct  the  Borrower  to pay (and the  Borrower
hereby promises to pay, upon receipt of such notice) to the Administrative Agent
additional cash, to be held by the Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders,  in a cash  collateral  account  as  additional  security  for  the LOC
Obligations in respect of subsequent drawings under all then outstanding Letters
of Credit in an amount equal to the maximum  aggregate amount which may be drawn
under all Letters of Credits then outstanding.

         (d)  Enforcement  of Rights.  Enforce any and all rights and  interests
created and existing under this Credit Agreement and the Credit  Documents,  all
rights and remedies  existing  under the  Collateral  Documents,  all rights and
remedies against any Pledgor or Guarantor and all rights of set-off.

         (e) Appointment of Receiver. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to the appointment of
a receiver for the assets and  properties of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries,
without notice of any kind  whatsoever and without regard to the adequacy of any
security for the Obligations or the solvency of any party bound for its payment,
to take  possession  of all or any  portion of the  business  operations  of the
Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  and to  exercise  such power as the court shall
confer upon such receiver.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if an Event of Default  specified  in
Section 9.1(f) shall occur with respect to the Credit Parties, then, without the
giving of any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders,
(A) the Revolving  Commitments  shall  automatically  terminate,  (B) all of the
outstanding  Credit Obligations  automatically  shall immediately become due and
payable  and (C) the  Borrower  automatically  shall be  obligated  (and  hereby
promises) to pay to the Administrative  Agent additional cash, to be held by the
Administrative  Agent,  for the  benefit of the  Lenders,  in a cash  collateral
account as additional  security for the LOC Obligations in respect of subsequent
drawings under all then outstanding  Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the
maximum  aggregate  amount  which may be drawn under all Letters of Credits then
outstanding.

Section 9.3 Allocation of Proceeds.

         If an Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be  continuing  and
maturity of any of the Obligations has been  accelerated,  all payments received
by the Administrative Agent under any of the Credit Documents, in respect of any
principal of or interest on the  Obligations or any other amounts payable by the
Borrower  hereunder or thereunder,  shall be applied in accordance  with Section
3.17(b).

Section 9.4 Performance by Administrative Agent.

         If any  Credit  Party  shall  fail to  perform  any  covenant,  duty or
agreement  contained in any of the Credit Documents,  the  Administrative  Agent
may, upon notice to such Credit Party, as the case may be, perform or attempt to
perform such covenant,  duty or agreement on behalf of such Credit Party, as the
case may be, after the expiration of any cure or grace periods set forth herein;
provided,  however,  the Administrative  Agent's failure to give any such notice
shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the  Administrative  Agent.
In such event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the  Administrative  Agent,
promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the Administrative  Agent in such
performance or attempted  performance to the Administrative Agent, together with
interest  thereon at the Default  Rate from the date of such  expenditure  until
paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  neither the Administrative  Agent nor any
Lender shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the performance
of any  obligation of any Credit Party under this Credit  Agreement or any other
Credit Document.

Section 9.5 Rights Cumulative.

         The rights and  remedies  of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders
under this Credit  Agreement  and each of the other  Credit  Documents  shall be
cumulative  and not  exclusive  of any rights or remedies  which any of them may
otherwise have under applicable Law. In exercising  their respective  fights and
remedies  the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  may be  selective  and no
failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders in exercising
any right  shall  operate  as a waiver of it,  nor shall any  single or  partial
exercise  of any power or right  preclude  its other or further  exercise or the
exercise of any other power or fight.


                                    ARTICLE X

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

Section 10.1 Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent.

         (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints,  designates and authorizes
the Administrative  Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Credit  Agreement  and each other Credit  Document and to exercise  such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly  delegated to it by the terms of
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, together with such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained  elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document,  the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,  except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the  Administrative  Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions,  responsibilities,  duties,  obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Credit  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document or  otherwise  exist
against  the  Administrative  Agent.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of the
foregoing  sentence,  the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Credit
Documents with reference to the Administrative  Agent is not intended to connote
any  fiduciary or other  implied (or express)  obligations  arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of
market  custom,  and is  intended  to create or reflect  only an  administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.

         (b) The Issuing  Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit  issued by it and the documents  associated  therewith,
and the  Issuing  Lender  shall  have all of the  benefits  and  immunities  (i)
provided to the Administrative  Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts
taken or omissions  suffered by the Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of
Credit  issued by it or  proposed  to be issued by it and the  applications  and
agreements  for letters of credit  pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully
as if the  term  "Administrative  Agent"  as used in this  Article  X and in the
definition of "Agent-Related Person" included the Issuing Lender with respect to
such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to
the Issuing Lender.

Section 10.2 Delegation of Duties.

         The  Administrative  Agent may  execute  any of its  duties  under this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact  and  shall  be  entitled  to  advice  of  counsel  and  other
consultants  or experts  concerning all matters  pertaining to such duties.  The
Administrative  Agent shall not be responsible  for the negligence or misconduct
of any  agent  or  attorney-in-fact  that it  selects  in the  absence  of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 10.3 Liability of Administrative Agent.

         No  Agent-Related  Person  shall (a) be liable for any action  taken or
omitted  to be taken by any of them  under or in  connection  with  this  Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document or the transactions  contemplated  hereby
(except for its own gross  negligence or willful  misconduct in connection  with
its duties  expressly set forth herein),  or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Credit  Party or any  officer  thereof,  contained  herein or in any
other  Credit  Document,  or in any  certificate,  report,  statement  or  other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document,
or the validity,  effectiveness,  genuineness,  enforceability or sufficiency of
this Credit  Agreement or any other Credit  Document,  or for any failure of any
Credit  Party  or any  other  party  to  any  Credit  Document  to  perform  its
obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation  to any Lender or  participant  to  ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance  of any of the agreements  contained in, or conditions
of,  this  Credit  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document,  or to inspect the
properties, books or records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

Section 10.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent.

         (a) The  Administrative  Agent shall be entitled to rely,  and shall be
fully  protected  in  relying,  upon  any  writing,  communication,   signature,
resolution,  representation,  notice, consent,  certificate,  affidavit, letter,
telegram,  facsimile,  telex or  telephone  message,  electronic  mail  message,
statement  or other  document or  conversation  believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed,  sent or made by the proper  Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Credit
Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative  Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Credit  Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so requests,  it shall first be indemnified to its  satisfaction  by the Lenders
against any and all  liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative  Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting,  or in refraining from acting,  under
this Credit  Agreement or any other Credit Document in accordance with a request
or consent of the Required  Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be
expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

         (b)  For  purposes  of  determining   compliance  with  the  conditions
specified  in Section  5.1,  each Lender  that has signed this Credit  Agreement
shall be deemed to have  consented  to,  approved or accepted or to be satisfied
with,  each document or other matter  required  thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the  Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed  Closing
Date specifying its objection thereto.

Section 10.5 Notice of Default.

         The  Administrative  Agent  shall not be deemed  to have  knowledge  or
notice of the occurrence of any Default,  except with respect to defaults in the
payment  of   principal,   interest  and  fees   required  to  be  paid  to  the
Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders,  unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Credit  Agreement,  describing such Default and stating that such notice
is a "notice of default."  The  Administrative  Agent will notify the Lenders of
its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative  Agent shall take such action
with  respect to such  Default as may be  directed  by the  Required  Lenders in
accordance  with  Article  IX;  provided,  however,  that  unless  and until the
Administrative  Agent has received any such direction,  the Administrative Agent
may (but shall not be  obligated  to) take such  action,  or refrain from taking
such action,  with respect to such Default as it shall deem  advisable or in the
best interest of the Lenders.

Section 10.6 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative Agent.

         Each  Lender  acknowledges  that no  Agent-Related  Person has made any
representation  or warranty to it, and that no act by the  Administrative  Agent
hereafter  taken,  including any consent to and  acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Credit  Party or any  Affiliate  thereof,  shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related  Person
to any Lender as to any matter,  including  whether  Agent-Related  Persons have
disclosed  material  information in their possession.  Each Lender represents to
the  Administrative  Agent that it has,  independently and without reliance upon
any  Agent-Related  Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed  appropriate,  made  its own  appraisal  of and  investigation  into  the
business,  prospects,  operations,  property,  financial and other condition and
creditworthiness  of the Credit Parties and their respective  Subsidiaries,  and
all  applicable  bank or other  regulatory  Laws  relating  to the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  and  made its own  decision  to enter  into  this  Credit
Agreement  and to extend  credit to the  Borrower  hereunder.  Each  Lender also
represents  that  it  will,   independently   and  without   reliance  upon  any
Agent-Related  Person and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall
deem  appropriate  at the  time,  continue  to  make  its own  credit  analysis,
appraisals  and  decisions  in taking or not taking  action  under  this  Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents,  and to make such investigations as it
deems  necessary to inform  itself as to the  business,  prospects,  operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and
the other  Credit  Parties.  Except for  notices,  reports  and other  documents
expressly  required to be furnished to the Lenders by the  Administrative  Agent
herein,  the  Administrative  Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
prospects,    operations,   property,   financial   and   other   condition   or
creditworthiness  of any of  the  Credit  Parties  or  any of  their  respective
Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

Section 10.7 Indemnification of Administrative Agent.

         Whether or not the  transactions  contemplated  hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not  reimbursed  by or on behalf of any Credit  Party and without  limiting  the
obligation  of any Credit  Party to do so),  pro rata,  and hold  harmless  each
Agent-Related  Person  from  and  against  any and all  Indemnified  Liabilities
incurred  by it;  provided,  however,  that no Lender  shall be  liable  for the
payment  to  any  Agent-Related  Person  of  any  portion  of  such  Indemnified
Liabilities  to the extent  determined in a final,  nonappealable  judgment by a
court  of  competent  jurisdiction  to have  resulted  from  such  Agent-Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;  provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance  with the directions of the Required  Lenders (or all
Lenders if unanimous  approval is required  for such action)  shall be deemed to
constitute gross negligence or willful  misconduct for purposes of this Section.
Without   limitation  of  the  foregoing,   each  Lender  shall   reimburse  the
Administrative  Agent  upon  demand  for  its  ratable  share  of any  costs  or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution, delivery,  administration,
modification,  amendment or enforcement  (whether  through  negotiations,  legal
proceedings  or  otherwise)  of,  or  legal  advice  in  respect  of  rights  or
responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any
document  contemplated  by or  referred  to  herein,  to  the  extent  that  the
Administrative  Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower.  The  undertaking  in this Section  shall survive  termination  of the
Revolving  Commitment,  the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation
of the Administrative Agent.

Section 10.8 Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity.

         Bank of America and its  Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or  other  business  with  each  of the  Credit  Parties  and  their  respective
Affiliates  as though Bank of America were not the  Administrative  Agent or the
Issuing Lender  hereunder and without  notice to or consent of the Lenders.  The
Lenders  acknowledge that,  pursuant to such activities,  Bank of America or its
Affiliates may receive information  regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates
(including  information  that may be subject to  confidentiality  obligations in
favor  of such  Credit  Party  or  such  Affiliate)  and  acknowledge  that  the
Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to
them. With respect to its Loans,  Bank of America shall have the same rights and
powers under this Credit  Agreement  as any other  Lender and may exercise  such
rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative  Agent or the Issuing
Lender,  and the terms  "Lender"  and  "Lenders"  include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

Section 10.9 Successor Administrative Agent.

         The  Administrative  Agent may resign as  Administrative  Agent upon 30
days'  notice to the  Lenders;  provided  that any such  resignation  by Bank of
America  shall  also  constitute  its  resignation  as  Issuing  Lender.  If the
Administrative  Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement,  the Required Lenders
shall  appoint from among the Lenders a successor  administrative  agent for the
Lenders,  which  successor  administrative  agent shall be  consented  to by the
Borrower at all times other than during the  existence  of a Default or an Event
of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably  withheld or
delayed).  If no  successor  administrative  agent  is  appointed  prior  to the
effective  date  of  the   resignation   of  the   Administrative   Agent,   the
Administrative  Agent may  appoint,  after  consulting  with the Lenders and the
Borrower,  a successor  administrative  agent from among the  Lenders.  Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor  administrative agent hereunder,  the
Person acting as such  successor  administrative  agent shall succeed to all the
rights,  powers and duties of the retiring  Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Lender and the  respective  terms  "Administrative  Agent" and "Issuing  Lender"
shall mean such successor  administrative agent and Letter of Credit issuer, and
the  retiring   Administrative   Agent's  appointment,   powers  and  duties  as
Administrative  Agent shall be  terminated  and the  retiring  Issuing  Lender's
rights,  powers  and duties as such shall be  terminated,  without  any other or
further  act or deed on the part of such  retiring  Issuing  Lender or any other
Lender,  other than the  obligation  of the  successor  Issuing  Lender to issue
letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding
at the time of such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the
retiring  Issuing Lender to effectively  assume the  obligations of the retiring
Issuing  Lender  with  respect to such  Letters of  Credit.  After any  retiring
Administrative  Agent's  resignation  hereunder  as  Administrative  Agent,  the
provisions  of this  Article X and  Sections  11.2 and 11.8  shall  inure to its
benefit  as to any  actions  taken  or  omitted  to be  taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no successor administrative
agent has accepted  appointment as Administrative  Agent by the date which is 30
days  following a retiring  Administrative  Agent's notice of  resignation,  the
retiring  Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the  Administrative
Agent  hereunder  until such time,  if any, as the  Required  Lenders  appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

Section 10.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership,  insolvency,  liquidation,
bankruptcy,  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,  composition  or  other
judicial  proceeding  relative to any Credit  Party,  the  Administrative  Agent
(irrespective  of whether the principal of any Loan or LOC Obligation shall then
be due and  payable as herein  expressed  or by  declaration  or  otherwise  and
irrespective of whether the  Administrative  Agent shall have made any demand on
the  Borrower)  shall  be  entitled  and  empowered,  by  intervention  in  such
proceeding or otherwise

         (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and
         interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans,  LOC Obligations and
         all other  Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
         documents  as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims
         of the Lenders and the  Administrative  Agent  (including any claim for
         the reasonable  compensation,  expenses,  disbursements and advances of
         the Lenders and the  Administrative  Agent and their respective  agents
         and   counsel   and  all  other   amounts   due  the  Lenders  and  the
         Administrative  Agent  under  Sections  2.2(i)  and (j),  3.7 and 11.2)
         allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

         (b) to collect  and  receive  any monies or other  property  payable or
         deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian,  receiver,  assignee,  trustee,  liquidator,  sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial  proceeding is hereby  authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative  Agent and, in the event
that the  Administrative  Agent  shall  consent to the  making of such  payments
directly to the Lenders,  to pay to the Administrative  Agent any amount due for
the  reasonable  compensation,  expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  of  the
Administrative  Agent and its agents and counsel,  and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 3.7 and 11.2.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the  Administrative  Agent
to  authorize  or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan
of  reorganization,   arrangement,   adjustment  or  composition  affecting  the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Section 10.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters.

         The Lenders  irrevocably  authorize the  Administrative  Agent,  at its
         option and in its discretion,

         (a) to  release  any  Lien on any  property  granted  to or held by the
         Administrative  Agent under any Credit Document (i) upon termination of
         the Revolving Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other
         than  contingent  indemnification  obligations)  and the  expiration or
         termination  of all Letters of Credit,  (ii) that is sold or to be sold
         as part of or in connection with any sale permitted  hereunder or under
         any other  Credit  Document,  or (iii)  subject  to  Section  11.1,  if
         approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders;

         (b) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty if
         such  Person  ceases to be a  Subsidiary  as a result of a  transaction
         permitted hereunder.

Upon request by the Administrative  Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will
confirm  in  writing  the   Administrative   Agent's  authority  to  release  or
subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release
any Guarantor from its obligations  under the Guaranty  pursuant to this Section
10.11.


                                   ARTICLE XI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1      Amendments, Etc.

         No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement or any
other Credit Document,  and no consent to any departure by the Credit Parties or
any other Lender  therefrom,  shall be effective unless in writing signed by the
Required  Lenders and the Credit Parties or the applicable  Lender,  as the case
may be, and  acknowledged by the  Administrative  Agent, and each such waiver or
consent  shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the specific
purpose for which given;  provided,  however, that no such amendment,  waiver or
consent shall:

              (a) extend (other than as provided by Section 3.5) or increase the
         Revolving   Commitment  of  any  Lender  (or  reinstate  any  Revolving
         Commitment  terminated  pursuant  to Section  9.2)  without the written
         consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of
         any condition  precedent set forth in Section  5.2(b) or of any Default
         or Event of Default  shall not  constitute a change in the terms of any
         Revolving Commitment of any Lender);

              (b) postpone any date fixed by this Credit  Agreement or any other
         Credit Document for any payment  (excluding  mandatory  prepayments) of
         principal,  interest,  fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any
         of them)  hereunder  or under any other  Credit  Document  without  the
         written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

              (c) reduce the  principal  of, or the rate of  interest  specified
         herein  on,  any Loan or LOC  Borrowing,  or any fees or other  amounts
         payable  hereunder  or under  any other  Credit  Document  without  the
         written consent of each Lender  directly  affected  thereby;  provided,
         however,  that  only  the  consent  of the  Required  Lenders  shall be
         necessary  to waive any  obligation  of the Borrower to pay interest at
         the Default Rate;

              (d) change any  provision of this Credit  Agreement  regarding pro
         rata  sharing  or pro rata  funding  with  respect to (i) the making of
         advances (including participations),  (ii) the manner of application of
         payments or prepayments of principal, interest, fees, or other payments
         received  pursuant to Section 3.16,  (iii) the manner of application of
         reimbursement  obligations  from drawings  under Letters of Credit,  or
         (iv) the manner of  reduction of  commitments  and  committed  amounts,
         without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

              (e) change any  provision  of this  Section or the  definition  of
         "Required  Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number
         or percentage of Lenders  required to amend,  waive or otherwise modify
         any rights  hereunder  or make any  determination  or grant any consent
         hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender;

              (f) release all or substantially all of the Collateral without the
         written consent of each Lender; or

              (g) except as the result of or in connection  with a  dissolution,
         merger or  disposition  of a Credit Party not prohibited by Section 8.3
         or Section 8.4, release the Borrower or substantially  all of the other
         Credit Parties from its or their obligations under the Credit Documents
         without the written consent of each Lender;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing  and signed by the Issuing  Lender in  addition to the Lenders  required
above,  affect  the rights or duties of the  Issuing  Lender  under this  Credit
Agreement or any Letter of Credit  Application  relating to any Letter of Credit
issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless
in writing  and signed by the  Administrative  Agent in  addition to the Lenders
required above,  affect the rights or duties of the  Administrative  Agent under
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document; and (iii) the Fee Letter may
be amended,  or rights or privileges  thereunder  waived,  in a writing executed
only by the parties thereto.

         Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein,  no Defaulting Lender
shall have any right to approve or disapprove any  amendment,  waiver or consent
hereunder,  except that the  Commitment  of such Lender may not be  increased or
extended without the consent of such Lender.

         Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  consent  of all the  Lenders  is
required  in  certain  circumstances  as set  forth  above,  (x) each  Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy  reorganization  plan
that affects the Loans,  and each Lender  acknowledges  that the  provisions  of
Section  1126(c)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  supersedes  the  unanimous  consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders shall determine whether
or not to  allow a  Credit  Party to use cash  collateral  in the  context  of a
bankruptcy or insolvency  proceeding and such determination  shall be binding on
all of the Lenders.

mail address or telephone number specified in its  Administrative  Questionnaire
or to such other address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone
number as shall be  designated  by such party in a notice to the  Borrower,  the

         All such notices and other  communications  shall be deemed to be given
or made upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual  receipt by the  relevant  party
hereto and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on

Days after deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile,
when sent and receipt has been  confirmed by telephone;  and (D) if delivered by

communications  to the  Administrative  Agent and the Issuing Lender pursuant to
Article II shall not be effective until actually  received by such Person. In no
event shall a  voicemail  message be  effective  as a notice,  communication  or
confirmation hereunder.

         (b)  Effectiveness  of  Facsimile  Documents  and  Signatures.   Credit
Documents may be transmitted  and/or signed by facsimile.  The  effectiveness of
any such documents and  signatures  shall,  subject to applicable  Law, have the
same force and effect as  manually-signed  originals and shall be binding on all
Credit Parties,  the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders.  The Administrative
Agent may also require that any such  documents and signatures be confirmed by a

         (d) Reliance by Administrative  Agent and Lenders.  The  Administrative
Agent  and the  Lenders  shall be  entitled  to rely  and act  upon any  notices
(including a telephonic  Loan Notice)  purportedly  given by or on behalf of the

were  incomplete  or were not  preceded  or followed by any other form of notice
specified  herein,  or (ii) the terms  thereof,  as understood by the recipient,
varied from any  confirmation  thereof.  The Credit Parties shall indemnify each
Agent-Related  Person and each  Lender  from all  losses,  costs,  expenses  and
liabilities   resulting  from  the  reliance  by  such  Person  on  each  notice
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and
other  communications  with the  Administrative  Agent  may be  recorded  by the
Administrative  Agent,  and each of the parties  hereto hereby  consents to such
recording.

Section 11.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

         No failure by any Lender or the Administrative  Agent to exercise,  and
no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right,  remedy,  power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.  The rights,  remedies,  powers and  privileges  herein  provided are
cumulative  and not  exclusive of any rights,  remedies,  powers and  privileges
provided by law.

Section 11.4 Attorney Costs, Expenses and Taxes.

         The Credit Parties  jointly and severally agree (a) to pay or reimburse
the Administrative  Agent for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this Credit Agreement
and the other  Credit  Documents  and any  amendment,  waiver,  consent or other
modification  of  the  provisions   hereof  and  thereof  (whether  or  not  the
transactions   contemplated   hereby  or  thereby  are  consummated),   and  the
consummation  and  administration  of the transactions  contemplated  hereby and
thereby,  including all reasonable  Attorney Costs,  and (b) to pay or reimburse
the Administrative  Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the enforcement,  attempted enforcement,  or preservation of any
rights or remedies  under this Credit  Agreement or the other  Credit  Documents
(including  all such  costs  and  expenses  incurred  during  any  "workout"  or
restructuring  in respect of the  Obligations  and during any legal  proceeding,
including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law),  including all reasonable
Attorney  Costs.  The  foregoing  costs and expenses  shall  include all search,
filing,  recording,  title  insurance and  appraisal  charges and fees and taxes
related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent and the cost of independent  public  accountants and other outside experts
retained by the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this
Section 11.4 shall be payable  within ten Business  Days after demand  therefor.
The  agreements in this Section shall survive the  termination  of the Revolving
Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

Section 11.5 Indemnification by the Credit Parties.

         Whether or not the  transactions  contemplated  hereby are consummated,
the Credit Parties  jointly and severally shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Agent-Related  Person, each Lender and their respective  Affiliates,  directors,
officers,  employees,  counsel,  agents and attorneys-in-fact  (collectively the
"Indemnitees")  from and against any and all liabilities,  obligations,  losses,
damages, penalties,  claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
and  disbursements  (including  Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever
which may at any time be imposed on,  incurred  by or asserted  against any such
Indemnitee  in any way relating to or arising out of or in  connection  with (a)
the  execution,  delivery,  enforcement,  performance or  administration  of any
Credit  Document  or any other  agreement,  letter or  instrument  delivered  in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Revolving Commitment,  Loan or Letter
of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds  therefrom  (including  any
refusal by the Issuing  Lender to honor a demand for  payment  under a Letter of
Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly
comply  with the terms of such  Letter of  Credit),  (c) any  actual or  alleged
presence or release of Hazardous  Materials on or from any property currently or
formerly owned or operated by any of the Credit  Parties,  or any  Environmental
Liability  related  in any  way to the  Credit  Parties,  or (d) any  actual  or
prospective claim,  litigation,  investigation or proceeding  relating to any of
the foregoing,  whether based on contract,  tort or any other theory  (including
any investigation  of,  preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim,  investigation,  litigation or proceeding)  and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"), in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in
part,  out of the  negligence of the  Indemnitee;  provided that such  indemnity
shall  not,  as to  any  Indemnitee,  be  available  to  the  extent  that  such
liabilities,  obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of such  Indemnitee.  No Indemnitee
shall  be  liable  for  any  damages  arising  from  the  use by  others  of any
information  or other  materials  obtained  through  IntraLinks or other similar
information  transmission systems in connection with this Credit Agreement,  nor
shall any  Indemnitee  have any  liability  for any  indirect  or  consequential
damages  relating  to this  Credit  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document or
arising out of its  activities  in  connection  herewith or  therewith  (whether
before or after the Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section 11.5 shall
be payable  within ten Business Days after demand  therefor.  The  agreements in
this Section shall survive the  resignation  of the  Administrative  Agent,  the
replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Revolving  Commitments and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

Section 11.6 Payments Set Aside.

         To the extent that any  payment by or on behalf of any Credit  Party is
made to the Administrative  Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender  exercises its right of set-off,  and such payment or the proceeds of
such set-off or any part  thereof is  subsequently  invalidated,  declared to be
fraudulent or  preferential,  set aside or required  (including  pursuant to any
settlement  entered  into by the  Administrative  Agent  or such  Lender  in its
discretion)  to be  repaid  to a  trustee,  receiver  or  any  other  party,  in
connection  with any proceeding  under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise,  then
(a) to the extent of such recovery,  the  obligation or part thereof  originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not  occurred,  and (b)
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent upon demand its
applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent,  plus  interest  thereon  from the date of such  demand  to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
time in effect.

Section 11.7 Successors and Assigns.

         (a) The provisions of this Credit  Agreement  shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their  respective  successors and
assigns permitted  hereby,  except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or  obligations  hereunder  without the prior written
consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations  hereunder except (i) to an Eligible  Assignee (as defined
in Section 11.7(g) below) in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of
this Section,  (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of
subsection  (d) of this  Section,  or (iii) by way of pledge or  assignment of a
security  interest  subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) or (h) of this
Section  (and any other  attempted  assignment  or transfer by any party  hereto
shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be  construed  to confer upon any Person  (other than the parties  hereto,
their respective  successors and assigns permitted  hereby,  Participants to the
extent  provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent  expressly
contemplated  hereby,  the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right,  remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement.

         (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees
all or a portion of its  rights and  obligations  under  this  Credit  Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans (including
for purposes of this subsection (b),  participations  in LOC Obligations) at the
time owing to it);  provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's  Revolving  Commitment and the
Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an  assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection  (g) of this
Section)  with  respect  to a Lender,  the  aggregate  amount  of the  Revolving
Commitment  (which  for this  purpose  includes  Loans  outstanding  thereunder)
subject to each such  assignment,  determined as of the date the  Assignment and
Assumption  with respect to such  assignment is delivered to the  Administrative
Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and  Assumption,  as of
the  Trade  Date,  shall  not  be  less  than  $5,000,000  unless  each  of  the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing,  the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate  part of all the assigning  Lender's rights and
obligations  under  this  Credit  Agreement  with  respect  to the  Loans or the
Revolving  Commitment  assigned;  (iii) any assignment of a Revolving Commitment
must be approved by the  Administrative  Agent and the Issuing Lender unless the
Person  that is the  proposed  assignee  is itself a Lender  (whether or not the
proposed  assignee  would  otherwise  qualify as an  Eligible  Assignee),  which
approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed; and (iv) the parties to
each  assignment  shall  execute  and  deliver  to the  Administrative  Agent an
Assignment and  Assumption,  together with a processing and  recordation  fee of
$3,500.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to subsection  (c) of this Section,  from and after the effective  date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption,  the Eligible  Assignee  thereunder
shall be a party to this Credit  Agreement  and,  to the extent of the  interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Credit  Agreement,  and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
to the extent of the interest  assigned by such  Assignment and  Assumption,  be
released from its obligations  under this Credit  Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Assumption  covering all of the assigning  Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit  Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto but shall  continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.8, 3.11,
3.13, 11.4 and 11.5 with respect to facts and  circumstances  occurring prior to
the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower shall execute
and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender;  provided,  that any Note, if any, of
the assigning lender is  correspondingly  modified,  replaced or returned to the
Borrower.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under
this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for  purposes  of  this  Credit  Agreement  as  a  sale  by  such  Lender  of  a
participation  in such rights and  obligations in accordance with subsection (d)
of this Section.

         (c) The  Administrative  Agent,  acting  solely for this  purpose as an
agent of the Borrower,  shall  maintain at the  Administrative  Agent's Office a
copy of each  Assignment and  Assumption  delivered to it and a register for the
recordation  of the  names  and  addresses  of the  Lenders,  and the  Revolving
Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and LOC Obligations owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries  in  the  Register   shall  be   conclusive,   and  the  Borrower,   the
Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders  may treat  each  Person  whose  name is
recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Credit Agreement,  notwithstanding  notice to the contrary.
The Register  shall be available for  inspection by the Borrower and any Lender,
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (d) Any Lender may at any time,  without  the consent of, or notice to,
the Borrower or the  Administrative  Agent,  sell  participations  to any Person
(other  than a natural  person or a Credit  Party or any of the Credit  Parties'
Affiliates or Subsidiaries)  (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or
a portion of its Revolving  Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
participations in LOC Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender
shall remain solely  responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such  obligations and (iii) the Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent and the
other  Lenders  shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with such Lender in
connection  with  such  Lender's  rights  and  obligations   under  this  Credit
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument  pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation  shall  provide  that such Lender  shall  retain the sole right to
enforce this Credit  Agreement  and to approve any  amendment,  modification  or
waiver of any provision of this Credit  Agreement;  provided that such agreement
or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,  without the consent of the
Participant,  agree to any amendment,  waiver or other modification described in
the first  proviso to  Section  11.1 that  directly  affects  such  Participant.
Subject  to  subsection  (e) of this  Section,  the  Borrower  agrees  that each
Participant  shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.8, 3.11 and 3.13 to
the  same  extent  as if it were a  Lender  and had  acquired  its  interest  by
assignment  pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted
by law, each  Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9
as though it were a Lender,  provided such  Participant  agrees to be subject to
Section 3.15 as though it were a Lender.

         (e) A Participant  shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 3.8 or 3.11 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation  sold to such Participant,  unless the
sale of the  participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
written  consent.  A  Participant  that  would be a Foreign  Lender if it were a
Lender  shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.8 unless the Borrower
is notified of the  participation  sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees,  for the benefit of the Borrower,  to comply with Section 3.13 as though
it were a Lender.

         (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Credit  Agreement  (including  under
its Revolving Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,  including any
pledge or assignment to secure  obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;  provided
that no such  pledge or  assignment  shall  release  such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

              "Eligible  Assignee"  means (a) a Lender;  (b) an  Affiliate  of a
         Lender;  (c) an Approved  Fund;  and (d) any other Person (other than a
         natural  person)  approved  by (i)  the  Administrative  Agent  and the
         Issuing  Lender,  and (ii)  unless a Default or an Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing,  the Borrower (each such approval not to be
         unreasonably  withheld or delayed);  provided that  notwithstanding the
         foregoing,  "Eligible  Assignee"  shall not include any Credit Party or
         any Affiliates or Subsidiary of any Credit Party.

              "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
         (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business.

              "Approved  Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by
         (a) a  Lender,  (b) an  Affiliate  of a Lender  or (c) an  entity or an
         Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

         (h)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained  herein,  any
Lender  that is a Fund may create a security  interest  in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Revolving  Note, if any, held by it to the trustee
for holders of obligations owed, or securities  issued, by such Fund as security
for such obligations or securities,  provided that unless and until such trustee
actually  becomes  a Lender in  compliance  with the  other  provisions  of this
Section 11.7,  (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging  Lender from any of
its  obligations  under the Credit  Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise  any of the rights of a Lender  under the Credit  Documents
even though such trustee may have acquired  ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

         (i)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein, if at
any time Bank of  America  assigns  all of its  Revolving  Commitment  and Loans
pursuant to subsection  (b) above,  Bank of America may, upon 30 days' notice to
the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Lender. In the event of any such
resignation  as Issuing  Lender,  the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from
among  the  Lenders  a  successor  Issuing  Lender  hereunder,  subject  to  the
acceptance of such  appointment  by such  successor  Issuing  Lender;  provided,
however,  that no failure by the  Borrower to appoint any such  successor  shall
affect the resignation of Bank of America as Issuing Lender.  If Bank of America
resigns as Issuing Lender, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of
the effective date of its  resignation as Issuing Lender and all LOC Obligations
with respect  thereto  (including  the right to require the Lenders to make Base
Rate Loans or fund risk  participations  in  Unreimbursed  Amounts  pursuant  to
Section 2.2(c)). Unless and until a successor Issuing Lender is so appointed and
accepts such appointment, no new Letters of Credit shall be issued.

Section 11.8 Confidentiality.

         Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality  of the Information (as defined below),  except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors,  officers,  employees
and agents,  including  accountants,  legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood  that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the  confidential  nature  of such  Information  and  instructed  to  keep  such
Information  confidential);  (b)  to the  extent  requested  by  any  regulatory
authority;  (c) to the extent  required by applicable  Laws or regulations or by
any  subpoena or similar  legal  process;  (d) to any other party to this Credit
Agreement;  (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any
suit, action or proceeding  relating to this Credit Agreement or the enforcement
of  rights  hereunder;   (f)  subject  to  an  agreement  containing  provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of
or Participant  in, or any prospective  Eligible  Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations  under this Credit Agreement or (ii) any direct
or  indirect  contractual  counterparty  or  prospective  counterparty  (or such
contractual counterparty's or prospective  counterparty's  professional advisor)
to any credit  derivative  transaction  relating  to  obligations  of the Credit
Parties;  (g)  with  the  consent  of  the  Borrower;  (h) to  the  extent  such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
on a nonconfidential  basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i) to the
National   Association   of  Insurance   Commissioners   or  any  other  similar
organization. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose
the  existence  of this  Credit  Agreement  and  information  about this  Credit
Agreement to market data  collectors,  similar service  providers to the lending
industry,  and service providers to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders in
connection with the administration and management of this Credit Agreement,  the
other Credit Documents, the Revolving Commitments,  the Loans and the Letters of
Credit.  For the purposes of this Section,  "Information"  means all information
received  from any Credit Party  relating to any Credit  Party or its  business,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender on a  nonconfidential  basis prior to disclosure by any Credit Party;
provided that, in the case of information received from a Credit Party after the
date hereof,  such  information is clearly  identified in writing at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information  as provided in this Section  shall be  considered  to have complied
with its  obligation  to do so if such Person has  exercised  the same degree of
care to maintain the  confidentiality  of such  Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

Section 11.9 Set-off.

         In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders  provided by law,
upon the  occurrence and during the  continuance  of any Event of Default,  each
Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,  without prior notice to
the  Borrower or any other  Credit  Party,  any such notice  being waived by the
Borrower  (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Credit  Party) to the fullest
extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits  (general or
special,  time or demand,  provisional  or final) at any time held by, and other
indebtedness  at any time  owing by,  such  Lender  to or for the  credit or the
account of the respective  Credit Parties against any and all Obligations  owing
to such Lender  hereunder or under any other Credit  Document,  now or hereafter
existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender
shall have made demand under this Credit  Agreement or any other Credit Document
and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a
currency  different from that of the applicable  deposit or  indebtedness.  Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender;  provided,  however,  that
the failure to give such notice  shall not affect the  validity of such  set-off
and application.

Section 11.10 Interest Rate Limitation.

         Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  contained  in  any  Credit
Document,  the  interest  paid or agreed to be paid under the  Credit  Documents
shall  not  exceed  the  maximum  rate of  non-usurious  interest  permitted  by
applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender
shall receive  interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum  Rate,  the excess
interest  shall be applied to the  principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such
unpaid principal,  refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for,  charged,  or received by the  Administrative  Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, (a) characterize  any payment that is not principal as an expense,  fee, or
premium rather than interest,  (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof,  and (c) amortize,  prorate,  allocate,  and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total  amount of  interest  throughout  the  contemplated  term of the
Obligations hereunder.

Section 11.11 Counterparts.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

Section 11.12 Integration.

         This  Credit  Agreement,  together  with the  other  Credit  Documents,
comprises  the complete and  integrated  agreement of the parties on the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements,  written or oral,
on such subject matter.  In the event of any conflict  between the provisions of
this Credit Agreement and those of any other Credit Document,  the provisions of
this Credit Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental
rights or  remedies in favor of the  Administrative  Agent or the Lenders in any
other Credit Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Credit Agreement.
Each Credit Document was drafted with the joint  participation of the respective
parties  thereto  and shall be  construed  neither  against  nor in favor of any
party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

Section 11.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

         All  representations  and  warranties  made  hereunder and in any other
Credit  Document or other document  delivered  pursuant  hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof
and thereof.  Such  representations  and warranties  have been or will be relied
upon  by  the   Administrative   Agent  and  each  Lender,   regardless  of  any
investigation made by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender or on their behalf
and  notwithstanding  that the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have had
notice or  knowledge  of any  Default at the time of any Credit  Extension,  and
shall  continue  in full  force  and  effect  as long as any  Loan or any  other
Obligation  hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit
shall remain outstanding.

Section 11.14 Severability.

         If any provision of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,  (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability  of the  remaining  provisions  of this Credit  Agreement and the
other  Credit  Documents  shall not be affected or impaired  thereby and (b) the
parties  shall  endeavor  in good faith  negotiations  to replace  the  illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which  comes  as  close  as  possible  to  that  of  the  illegal,   invalid  or
unenforceable  provisions.  The  invalidity  of  a  provision  in  a  particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render  unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

Section 11.15 Governing Law.

         (a) THIS  CREDIT  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE  GOVERNED  BY, AND  CONSTRUED  IN
ACCORDANCE  WITH, the LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely within such State; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE
Agent AND EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

         (b) ANY  LEGAL  ACTION  OR  PROCEEDING  WITH  RESPECT  TO  THIS  CREDIT
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK  SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY OR OF THE UNITED  STATES FOR THE  SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS CREDIT  AGREEMENT,
THE CREDIT  PARTIES,  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  Agent AND EACH LENDER  CONSENTS,  FOR
ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS  PROPERTY,  TO THE  NON-EXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION  OF
THOSE  COURTS.  THE CREDIT  PARTIES,  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  Agent AND EACH LENDER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON  CONVENIENS,  WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT
OF ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT  RELATED  THERETO.  THE CREDIT PARTIES,
THE ADMINISTRATIVE Agent AND EACH LENDER WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS,
COMPLAINT OR OTHER  PROCESS,  WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS  PERMITTED BY
THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.

Section 11.16 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury.

         EACH PARTY TO THIS CREDIT  AGREEMENT  HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,  DEMAND,  ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER
ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS  OF THE  PARTIES  HERETO  OR ANY OF THEM  WITH  RESPECT  TO ANY  CREDIT
DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE;  AND
EACH PARTY HEREBY  AGREES AND CONSENTS  THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,  DEMAND,  ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION  SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT  TRIAL  WITHOUT A JURY,  AND THAT ANY
PARTY TO THIS CREDIT  AGREEMENT  MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL  COUNTERPART  OR A COPY OF
THIS  SECTION  WITH  ANY  COURT  AS  WRITTEN  EVIDENCE  OF  THE  CONSENT  OF THE
SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
