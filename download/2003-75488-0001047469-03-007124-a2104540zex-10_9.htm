shall not constitute a claim (as defined in Section&nbsp;101(5) of the Bankruptcy Law) against such CP Conduit until such time, if any, as such CP Conduit has Excess Funds in an amount equal to such
excess, and (ii)&nbsp;the applicable Related Bank shall make up any such excess not otherwise paid by such CP Conduit. </FONT></P>
