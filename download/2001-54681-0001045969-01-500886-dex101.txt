the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan
Document, and Company, Agent or Requisite Lenders shall so request, Agent,
Lenders and Company shall

                                       44

negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the
original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval
of Requisite Lenders), provided that, until so amended, such ratio or
                       --------

            -------------------------------------------------

               A.  Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Company
herein set forth, each Lender hereby severally agrees to make the Loans
described in subsections 2.1A(i) and 2.1A(ii).

                      (i)  Term Loans. Each Lender that has a Term Loan
                           ----------
               Commitment severally agrees to lend to Company on the Closing
               Date an amount not exceeding its Pro Rata Share of the aggregate
               amount of the Term Loan Commitments to be used for the purposes
               identified in subsection 2.5A. The amount of each Lender's Term
               Loan Commitment is set forth opposite its name on Schedule 2.1
                                                                 ------------
               annexed hereto and the aggregate amount of the Term Loan
               Commitments is $30,000,000; provided that the Term Loan
                                           --------
               Commitments of Lenders shall be adjusted to give effect to any
               assignments of the Term Loan Commitments pursuant to subsection
               10.1B. Each Lender's Term Loan Commitment shall expire
               immediately and without further action on June 30, 2001 if the
               Term Loans are not made on or before that date. Company may make
               only one borrowing under the Term Loan Commitments. Amounts
               borrowed under this subsection 2.1A(i) and subsequently repaid or
               prepaid may not be reborrowed. Anything contained in this
               Agreement to the contrary

                                       45
<PAGE>

               notwithstanding, in no event shall the aggregate amount of Term
               Loans made on the Closing Date exceed the Term Borrowing Base in
               effect on the Closing Date.

                         (ii) Revolving Loans. Each Revolving Lender severally
                              ---------------
               agrees, subject to the limitations set forth below with respect
               to the maximum amount of Revolving Loans permitted to be
               outstanding from time to time, to lend to Company from time to
               time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the
               Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date an aggregate amount
               not exceeding its Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount of the
               Revolving Loan Commitments to be used for the purposes identified
               in subsection 2.5B. The original amount of each Revolving
               Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment is set forth opposite its name
               on Schedule 2.1 annexed hereto and the aggregate original amount
                  ------------
               of the Revolving Loan Commitments is $110,000,000; provided that
                                                                  --------
               the Revolving Loan Commitments of Revolving Lenders shall be
               adjusted to give effect to any assignments of the Revolving Loan
               Commitments pursuant to subsection 10.1B; and provided, further
                                                             --------  -------
               that the amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
               reduced from time to time by the amount of any reductions thereto
               made pursuant to subsection 2.4. Each Revolving Lender's
               Revolving Loan Commitment shall expire on the Revolving Loan
               Commitment Termination Date and all Revolving Loans and all other
               amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans and
               the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be paid in full no later
               than that date; provided that each Revolving Lender's Revolving
                               --------
               Loan Commitment shall expire immediately and without further
               action on June 30, 2001 if the Term Loans and the initial
               Revolving Loans are not made on or before that date. Amounts
               borrowed under this subsection 2.1A(ii) may be repaid and
               reborrowed to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
               Termination Date.

               Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Revolving Loans and the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
subject to the following limitations in the amounts indicated:

                         (a)  in no event shall the Total Utilization of
               Revolving Loan Commitments at any time exceed the Revolving Loan
               Commitments then in effect; and

                         (b)  in no event shall the Total Utilization of
               Revolving Loan Commitments at any time exceed the Revolving
               Borrowing Base then in effect.

               B.  Borrowing Mechanics. Term Loans or Revolving Loans made on
any Funding Date (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to subsection 3.3B)
shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and multiples of $250,000 in
excess of that amount; provided that Term Loans or Revolving Loans made on any
                       --------
Funding Date as Eurodollar Rate Loans with a particular Interest Period shall be
in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and multiples of $500,000 in excess
of that amount. Whenever Company desires that Lenders make Term Loans or
Revolving Loans it shall deliver to Agent a Notice of Borrowing no later than
1:00 P.M. (New York City time) at least three Business Days in advance of the
proposed

                                       46
<PAGE>

Funding Date (in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan) or on the proposed Funding
Date (in the case of a Base Rate Loan). Term Loans and Revolving Loans may be
continued as or converted into Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans in the
manner provided in subsection 2.2D. In lieu of delivering a Notice of Borrowing,
Company may give Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed
borrowing under this subsection 2.1B; provided that such notice shall be
                                      --------
promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a Notice of Borrowing to Agent on
or before the applicable Funding Date.

          Neither Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to Company in
acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that Agent believes in good
faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized
to borrow on behalf of Company or for otherwise acting in good faith under this
subsection 2.1B or under subsection 2.2D, and upon funding of Loans by Daily
Funding Lender and/or Lenders, and upon conversion or continuation of the
applicable basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any Loans
pursuant to subsection 2.2D, in each case in accordance with this Agreement,
pursuant to any such telephonic notice Company shall have effected Loans or a
conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder.

          Company shall notify Agent prior to the funding of any Loans in the
event that any of the matters to which Company is required to certify in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing is no longer true and correct as of the
applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by Company of the proceeds of any
Loans shall constitute a re-certification by Company, as of the applicable
Funding Date, as to the matters to which Company is required to certify in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing.

          Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6G, a
Notice of Borrowing for, or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation for conversion
to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu
thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the date given, and Company shall be
bound to make a borrowing or to effect a conversion or continuation in
accordance therewith.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.1B, no
Eurodollar Rate Loans may be made and no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a
Eurodollar Rate Loan until the earlier of the ninetieth day after the Closing
Date and the date specified by Agent to Company on which the primary syndication
of the Commitments and the Loans has been completed.

          C.  Disbursement of Funds.

                 (i)  Subject to this subsection 2.1C and subsection 2.1D, all
          Loans under this Agreement shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and
          proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being
          understood that neither Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for
          any default by any other Lender in that other Lender's obligation to
          make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment of any Lender
          to make the particular type of Loan requested be increased or
          decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that other
          Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder.

                                       47
<PAGE>

               (ii)  Upon receipt by Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to
          subsection 2.1B (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) for Revolving
          Loans that consist of Base Rate Loans and upon satisfaction or waiver
          of the conditions precedent specified in subsection 4.1 (in the case
          of Loans made on the Closing Date) and, subject to the provisions set
          forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph, subsection 4.2 (in the
          case of all Loans), Daily Funding Lender shall, without prior notice
          to the other Lenders, make such Revolving Loans for its own account on
          the applicable Funding Date (subject to settlement with the other
          Lenders in accordance with subsection 2.1D) by making the proceeds of
          such Revolving Loans available to Company on such Funding Date by
          causing an amount of same day funds equal to the proceeds of such
          Revolving Loans to be credited to the account of Company at the
          Funding and Payment Office. Such Revolving Loans shall constitute
          Revolving Loans by Daily Funding Lender for all purposes under the
          Loan Documents, subject to settlement with the other Lenders pursuant
          to subsection 2.1D. All interest accrued on any such Revolving Loans
          from the date made by Daily Funding Lender to the Settlement Date with
          respect thereto shall be for Daily Funding Lender's own account. Daily
          Funding Lender shall make Revolving Loans for its own account pursuant
          to this subsection 2.1C(ii) notwithstanding the fact that the
          principal amount of such Revolving Loans, when added to the aggregate
          principal amount of Daily Funding Lender's Revolving Loans then
          outstanding, may exceed Daily Funding Lender's Revolving Loan
          Commitment then in effect; provided that such Revolving Loans shall at
                                     --------
          all times be Obligations owed to Daily Funding Lender under this
          Agreement; and provided further that in no event shall the aggregate
                         -------- -------
          principal amount of all Revolving Loans, including such Revolving
          Loans, outstanding at any time exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan
          Commitments then in effect minus the Letter of Credit Usage as of such
                                     -----
          time.


               Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
          the conditions precedent specified in subsection 4.2 cannot be
          fulfilled with respect to any proposed Revolving Loans that consist of
          Base Rate Loans, Company shall, in its Notice of Borrowing or
          otherwise, give immediate written notice thereof (specifying the
          circumstances which prevent the conditions precedent from being
          fulfilled) to Agent, with a copy to each Lender, and Daily Funding
          Lender may (and each Lender hereby authorizes Daily Funding Lender
          to), but is not obligated to, continue to make Revolving Loans that
          are Base Rate Loans for 20 Business Days from the date Agent first
          receives such notice, or until sooner instructed by Requisite Lenders
          to cease making such Revolving Loans (the "Daily Funding Lender
          Discretionary Period").  Once notice is given by Company that
          circumstances exist which prevent the conditions precedent to
          borrowing from being fulfilled, no additional notice with respect to
          the same circumstances will be effective to commence a new Daily
          Funding Lender Discretionary Period.

               (iii) Promptly after receipt by Agent of a Notice of Borrowing
          pursuant to subsection 2.1B (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) for
          any Loans (other than for Revolving Loans that consist of Base Rate
          Loans), Agent shall notify each Lender of the proposed borrowing. Each
          Lender shall make the amount of its

                                       48
<PAGE>

          Loan available to Agent, in same day funds in Dollars, at the Funding
          and Payment Office, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on
          the applicable Funding Date, in each case in same day funds in
          Dollars, at the Funding and Payment Office. Except as provided in
          subsection 3.3B with respect to Revolving Loans used to reimburse any
          Issuing Lender for the amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit
          issued by it, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
          specified in subsections 4.1 (in the case of Loans made on the Closing
          Date) and, subject to the provisions set forth in the immediately
          preceding paragraph, 4.2 (in the case of all Loans), Agent shall make
          the proceeds of such Loans available to Company on the applicable
          Funding Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars equal
          to the proceeds of all such Loans received by Agent from Lenders to be
          credited to the account of Company at the Funding and Payment Office.

               Unless Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the
          Funding Date for any Loans pursuant to this subsection 2.1C that such
          Lender does not intend to make available to Agent the amount of such
          Lender's Loan requested on such Funding Date, Agent may assume that
          such Lender has made such amount available to Agent on such Funding
          Date and Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated
          to, make available to Company a corresponding amount on such Funding
          Date.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to
          Agent by such Lender, Agent shall be entitled to recover such
          corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest
          thereon, for each day from such Funding Date until the date such
          amount is paid to Agent, at the customary rate set by Agent for the
          correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and
          thereafter at the Base Rate.  If such Lender does not pay such
          corresponding amount forthwith upon Agent's demand therefor, Agent
          shall promptly notify Company and Company shall immediately pay such
          corresponding amount to Agent together with interest thereon, for each
          day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to
          Agent, at the rate payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans.
          Nothing in this subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
          from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to
          prejudice any rights that Company may have against any Lender as a
          result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

          D.  Settlement Procedures.

               (i)  Daily Funding Lender will from time to time notify the other
          Lenders, not later than 4:00 P.M. (New York time) (a) on at least one
          Business Day during each seven calendar-day period, (b) on each date
          on which payment of interest on any Revolving Loans is required to be
          made pursuant to subsection 2.2C, (c) on the Revolving Loan Commitment
          Termination Date, and (d) at such other times as Daily Funding Lender
          in its discretion may determine (each such notice by Daily Funding
          Lender being a "Settlement Notice" and the date which is one Business
          Day after any Settlement Notice being a "Settlement Date") of the
          aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans made

                                       49
<PAGE>

          by Daily Funding Lender and each other Lender as of the close of
          business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable
          Settlement Date.

               (ii)  If a Settlement Notice indicates that the aggregate
          principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans made by Daily Funding
          Lender (including Revolving Loans made for its own account pursuant to
          subsection 2.1C(ii)) is in excess of Daily Funding Lender's Pro Rata
          Share of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans
          made by all Lenders (the amount of such excess being the "Excess
          Funded Amount"), each other Lender will, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New
          York time) on the applicable Settlement Date, pay to Daily Funding
          Lender, by depositing same day funds in the account specified by Daily
          Funding Lender at the Funding and Payment Office, an amount equal to
          such Lender's Adjusted Pro Rata Share of the Excess Funded Amount,
          upon which payment Daily Funding Lender shall be deemed to have sold,
          and such Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, as of the
          applicable Settlement Date, a portion of the outstanding Revolving
          Loans made by Daily Funding Lender for its own account pursuant to
          subsection 2.1C(ii) on or after the immediately preceding Settlement
          Date equal to such Lender's Adjusted Pro Rata Share of the Excess
          Funded Amount. The obligation of each Lender to purchase a portion of
          any Revolving Loan made by Daily Funding Lender as provided in this
          subsection 2.1D(ii) is subject to the condition that at the time such
          Revolving Loan was made by Daily Funding Lender (a) the duly
          authorized officer of Daily Funding Lender responsible for the
          administration of Daily Funding Lender's credit relationship with
          Company believed in good faith that either (X) no Event of Default had
          occurred and was continuing or (Y) any Event of Default that had
          occurred and was continuing had been waived by Requisite Lenders at
          the time such Revolving Loan was made or (b) a Daily Funding Lender
          Discretionary Period was in effect.

               (iii) If a Settlement Notice indicates that the aggregate
          principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans made by Daily Funding
          Lender is less than Daily Funding Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
          aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans made by all
          Lenders (the amount of such difference being the "Excess Paydown
          Amount"), Daily Funding Lender will, no later than 4:00 P.M. (New York
          time) on the applicable Settlement Date, unconditionally pay to each
          other Lender, by depositing same day funds in the account specified by
          such Lender to Daily Funding Lender, an amount equal to such Lender's
          Adjusted Pro Rata Share of the Excess Paydown Amount, upon which
          payment such Lender shall be deemed to have sold, and Daily Funding
          Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, as of the applicable
          Settlement Date, a portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of such
          Lender equal to such Lender's Adjusted Pro Rata Share of the Excess
          Paydown Amount.

               (iv)  Except as provided in subsection 2.1D(ii), the obligations
          of Daily Funding Lender and each other Lender pursuant to subsections
          2.1D(ii) and 2.1D(iii) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
          not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation,
          (a) any set-off, counterclaim,

                                       50

          recoupment, defense or other right which Agent or any Lender may have
          against Agent, any other Lender, any Loan Party or any other Person
          for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuance of an
          Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default; (c) any adverse
          change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of Holdings, Company
          or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) any breach of this Agreement by
          Company, Agent or any Lender; or (e) any other circumstance,
          happening, or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
          foregoing. In the event that any Person (the "Payor") obligated to
          make a payment to any other Person (the "Payee") pursuant to this
          subsection 2.1D fails to make available to the Payee the amount of
          such payment required to be made by the Payor, the Payee shall be
          entitled to recover such amount on demand from the Payor together with
          interest at the customary rate set by BTCo for the correction of
          errors among Lenders for three Business Days and thereafter at the sum
          of the Base Rate plus 1.50% per annum.

               (v)  In the event that all or any portion of any repayment of
          principal of the Revolving Loans is thereafter recovered by or on
          behalf of Company from Daily Funding Lender (including any such
          recovery in a proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
          or other similar law now or hereafter in effect) in an amount that is
          proportionately greater (based on the respective Pro Rata Shares of
          Lenders) than any such recovery from the other Lenders, the loss of
          the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders in
          the manner contemplated by subsection 10.5.

          E.  The Register.

          Agent, acting for these purposes solely as an agent of Company (it
being acknowledged that Agent, in such capacity, and its officers, directors,
employees, agent and affiliates shall constitute Indemnitees under subsection
10.3), shall maintain (and make available for inspection by Company and Lenders
upon reasonable prior notice at reasonable times) at its address referred to in
subsection 10.8 a register for the recordation of, and shall record, the names
and addresses of Lenders and the Term Loan Commitment, Revolving Loan
Commitment, Term Loan and Revolving Loans of each Lender from time to time (the
"Register"). Company, Agent and Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed
as Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of the corresponding
Commitments and Loans listed therein for all purposes hereof; all amounts owed
with respect to any Commitment or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed in the
Register as the owner thereof; and any request, authority or consent of any
Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding
Commitments or Loans. Each Lender shall record on its internal records the
amount of its Loans and Commitments and each payment in respect hereof, and any
such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Company, absent manifest
error, subject to the entries in the Register, which shall, absent manifest
error, govern in the event of any inconsistency with any Lender's records.
Failure to make any recordation in the Register or in any Lender's records, or
any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Loans or Commitments or any
Obligations in respect of any Loans.

          F.   Notes. Company shall execute and deliver on the Closing Date (i)
to Lenders (or to Agent for Lenders) (a) a Term Note substantially in the form
of Exhibit V annexed hereto to evidence each Lender's Term Loan, in the
   ---------
principal amount of that Lender's Term Loan and with other appropriate
insertions, and (b) a Revolving Note substantially in the form of Exhibit IV
                                                                  ----------

     2.2  Interest on the Loans.
          ---------------------

               A. Rate of Interest. Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.6
and 2.7, each Term Loan and each Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by reference to, in the case of
Loans, the Base Rate or the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate. The applicable basis for
determining the rate of interest with respect to any Term Loan or any Revolving
Loan shall be selected by Company initially at the time a Notice of Borrowing is
given with respect to such Loan pursuant to subsection 2.1B (subject to the last
sentence of subsection 2.1B), and the basis for determining the interest rate
with respect to any Term Loan or Revolving Loan may be changed from time to time
pursuant to subsection 2.2D (subject to the last sentence of subsection 2.1B).
If on any day a Term Loan or Revolving Loan is outstanding with respect to which
notice has not been delivered to Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest,
then for that day that Loan shall bear interest determined by reference to the
Base Rate.

               (i)  Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E, 2.2G and
          2.7, the Loans shall bear interest through maturity as follows:

                    (a)  if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base Rate
               plus the Base Rate Margin set forth in the table below opposite
               the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the four Fiscal Quarter
               period for which the applicable Pricing Certificate has been
               delivered pursuant to subsection 6.1(iv); or

                    (b)  if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at the sum of the
               Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Eurodollar Rate Margin set
               forth in the table below opposite the Consolidated Leverage Ratio
               for the four Fiscal Quarter period for which the applicable
               Pricing Certificate has been delivered pursuant to subsection
               6.1(iv):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Consolidated Leverage Ratio            Eurodollar Rate         Base Rate

     Greater than or equal to 2.50:1.0 but        2.75%                1.75%
     less than 3.00:1.0

     Greater than or equal to 2.25:1.0 but        2.50%                1.50%
     less than 2.50:1.0

     Less than 2.25:1.0                           2.25%                1.25%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

provided that, until the delivery of the Pricing Certificate for the first
--------
Fiscal Quarter ending one year after the Closing Date, the applicable margin for
Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be 2.75% per annum and Loans that are
Base Rate Loans shall be 1.75% per annum.

               (ii) Upon delivery of the Pricing Certificate by Company to Agent
          pursuant to subsection 6.1(iv), the Base Rate Margin and the
          Eurodollar Rate Margin shall automatically be adjusted in accordance
          with such Pricing Certificate, such adjustment to become effective on
          the next succeeding Business Day following the receipt by Agent of
          such Pricing Certificate (subject to the provisions of the foregoing
          clause (i)); provided that, if at any time (a) a Pricing Certificate
                       --------
          is not delivered at the time required pursuant to subsection 6.1(iv),
          from the time such Pricing Certificate was required to be delivered
          until delivery of such Pricing Certificate, or (b) an Event of Default
          or a Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing,
          such applicable margins shall be the maximum percentage amount for the
          relevant Loan set forth above.

          B.   Interest Periods. In connection with each Eurodollar Rate
Loan, Company may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an interest period (each an
"Interest Period") to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period shall
be, at Company's option, either a one, two, three, or, subject to all Lenders'
approval, six or twelve month period; provided that:
                                      --------

               (i)    the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan
          shall commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Loan, in the
          case of a Loan initially made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on the
          date specified in the applicable Notice of Conversion/Continuation, in
          the case of a Loan converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan;

               (ii)   in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods
          applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan continued as such pursuant to a
          Notice of Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest Period
          shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period
          expires;

               (iii)  if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that
          is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
          succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest Period would
                                   --------
          otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of
          the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,
          such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

               (iv)   any Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day
          of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically
          corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest
          Period) shall, subject to clause (v) of this subsection 2.2B, end on
          the last Business Day of a calendar month;

                                       53
<PAGE>

               (v)    no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Term
          Loans shall extend beyond June 30, 2006, and no Interest Period with
          respect to any portion of the Revolving Loans shall extend beyond the
          Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date;

               (vi)   no Interest Period with respect to any type of Term Loans
          shall extend beyond a date on which Company is required to make a
          scheduled payment of principal of such type of Term Loans, unless the
          sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of such type of Term Loans
          that are Base Rate Loans plus (b) the aggregate principal amount of
          such type of Term Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans with Interest
          Periods expiring on or before such date equals or exceeds the
          principal amount required to be paid on such type of Term Loans on
          such date;

               (vii)  no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
          Revolving Loans shall extend beyond the date on which a permanent
          reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments is scheduled to occur
          unless the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving
          Loans that are Base Rate Loans plus (b) the aggregate principal amount
                                         ----
          of Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans with Interest
          Periods expiring on or before such date plus (c) the excess of the
                                                  ----
          Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect over the aggregate principal
          amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding equals or exceeds the
          permanent reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments that is
          scheduled to occur on such date;

               (viii) there shall be no more than ten (10) Interest Periods
          outstanding at any time; and

               (ix)   in the event Company fails to specify an Interest Period
          for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Notice of Borrowing or
          Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company shall be deemed to have
          selected an Interest Period of one month.

          C. Interest Payments. Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.2E,
interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to each Interest
Payment Date applicable to that Loan, upon any prepayment of that Loan (to the
extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity (including final
maturity); provided that in the event any Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
           --------
Loans are prepaid pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i), interest accrued on such
Revolving Loans through the date of such prepayment shall be payable on the next
succeeding Interest Payment Date applicable to Base Rate Loans (or, if earlier,
at final maturity).

          D.  Conversion or Continuation. Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.6, Company shall have the option (i) from and after the earlier to
occur of (a) the date which is 90 days after the Closing Date and (b) the date
on which Agent notifies Company that the primary syndication of the Commitments
and the Loans has been completed, to convert at any time all or any part of its
outstanding Term Loans or Revolving Loans equal to $500,000 and multiples of
$250,000 in excess of that amount from Loans bearing interest at a rate
determined by reference

                                       54
<PAGE>

to one basis to Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to an
alternative basis, or (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable
to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Loan equal to
$1,000,000 and multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount as a Eurodollar
Rate Loan; provided, however, that a Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be converted
           --------  -------
into a Base Rate Loan on the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable
thereto unless Company pays on such conversion date all amounts owing to Lenders
under subsection 2.6D.

          Company shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Agent no
later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance
of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate
Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed
conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation
of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). In lieu of delivering a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, Company may give Agent telephonic notice by the
required time of any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection
2.2D; provided that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by
      --------
delivery of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Agent on or before the
proposed conversion/continuation date. Upon receipt of written or telephonic
notice of any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2D, Agent
shall promptly transmit such notice by telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender
of the Loan subject to the Notice of Conversion/Continuation.

          E.  Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of
any Event of Default, upon notice to Company by Agent, the outstanding principal
amount of all Loans and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest
payments thereon not paid when due and any fees and other amounts then due and
payable hereunder, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition
interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable
Insolvency Laws) payable upon demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of
the interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement with respect to the
applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate
which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under
this Agreement for Base Rate Loans); provided that, in the case of Eurodollar
                                     --------
Rate Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time any
such increase in interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
thereupon become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon
demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise
payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the
increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a
permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any
Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Agent
or any Lender.

          F.   Computation of Interest. Interest on the Loans shall be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days
elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any
Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period
applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted
from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan
to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of
payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to
such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar
Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base

                                       55
<PAGE>

Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded;
provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's
--------
interest shall be paid on that Loan.

          G.   Limitation on Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto
to comply with all applicable usury laws, whether now existing or hereafter
enacted. Accordingly, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other document evidencing,
securing, guaranteeing or otherwise pertaining to the Obligations of Company to
Lenders, in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of the
maturity of indebtedness of Company to Lenders or otherwise, shall the interest
contracted for, charged or received by Lenders exceed the maximum amount
permissible under applicable law. If from any circumstances whatsoever
fulfillment of any provisions of this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan
Documents or of any other document evidencing, securing, guaranteeing or
otherwise pertaining to the Obligations of Company to Lenders, at the time
performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit
of validity prescribed by law, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled
shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any such
circumstances Lenders shall ever receive anything of value as interest or deemed
interest by applicable law under this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan
Documents or any other document evidencing, securing, guaranteeing or otherwise
pertaining to the Obligations of Company to Lenders or otherwise an amount that
would exceed the highest lawful amount (the "Maximum Rate"), such amount that
would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal
amount owing in connection with this Agreement or on account of any other
indebtedness of Company to Lenders, and not to the payment of interest, or if
such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal owing in
connection with this Agreement and such other indebtedness, such excess shall be
refunded to Company. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable
with respect to indebtedness of Company to Lenders, under any specific
contingency, exceeds the maximum nonusurious rate permitted under applicable
law, Lenders may, at their option (a) characterize any non-principal payment as
an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread
the total amount of interest throughout the full term of such indebtedness so
that the actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed
the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, and/or (d) allocate interest
between portions of the Obligations, to the end that no such portion shall bear
interest at a rate greater than that permitted by law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any Obligations is calculated
at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this Agreement, and
thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of
interest payable on such Obligations shall remain at the Maximum Rate until each
Lender shall have received the amount of interest which such Lender would have
received during such period on such Obligations had the rate of interest not
been limited to the Maximum Rate during such period.

     2.3  Fees.
          ----


          A.   Commitment Fees. Company agrees to pay to Agent, for distribution
to each Revolving Lender in proportion to that Revolving Lender's Pro Rata
Share, commitment fees for the period from and including the Closing Date to and
excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date equal to the average of
the daily excess of the Revolving Loan Commitments over the Total Utilization of
Revolving Loan Commitments multiplied by 1/2 of
                           -------------

                                       56
<PAGE>

1% per annum, such commitment fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year and the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable monthly in arrears
on the first Business Day of each calendar month, commencing on the first such
date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date.

          B.   Other Fees. Company hereby assumes liability for the payment to
BTCo and Agent of all fees payable by K&C as set forth in the fee letter dated
as of May 29, 2001 between K&C and BTCo, in the amounts and at the times set
forth in such fee letter. In connection with Company's assumption of such
liabilities, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that K&C is hereby released
from all obligations under such fee letter.

          Proceeds, or Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, as the case may be, that
          gave rise to such prepayment and, in the case of any prepayment

          Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, if any, relates to Inventory. In
          the event that Company shall subsequently determine that the actual

          the Loans in an amount equal to the amount of such excess, and Company
          shall concurrently therewith deliver to Agent an Officer's Certificate

                -----------------------------------------------------
     Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (1) any amount required to

     Loans to the full extent thereof, and (3) any amount required to be applied

     substantially all of the assets of a Subsidiary or operating divisions is
     sold) shall be applied first to prepay the Term Loans

<PAGE>

     in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of Term Loans
     then outstanding and (y) the aggregate amount of Term Borrowing Base
     applicable to the assets so sold or the assets of the Subsidiary so sold,
     in each case as of the date of such sale, second, to the extent of any

     remaining portion of such amount, to prepay the Revolving Loans in an
     amount equal to the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans
     then outstanding and (y) the aggregate amount of Revolving Borrowing Base
     applicable to the assets so sold or the assets of the Subsidiary or
     operating divisions so sold, in each case as of the date of such sale,

     extent thereof. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any
     amount required to be applied as a mandatory prepayment shall be applied as

          (c)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments of Term Loans to Scheduled

     ---------------------------------
     Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii), subject to the last sentence of
     subsection 2.4B(iv)(b), shall be applied to reduce the scheduled
     installments of principal of the Term Loans set forth in subsection 2.4A in
     inverse chronological order.

          (d)  Application of Prepayments to Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate
               -----------------------------------------------------------------
     Loans. Considering Term Loans and Revolving Loans being prepaid separately,
     -----
     any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the
     full extent thereof before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each
     case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be
     made by Company pursuant to subsection 2.6D. To the extent that Company is
     required to make a mandatory prepayment of the Loans which is required to
     be applied to Eurodollar Rate Loans (following the operation of the
     immediately preceding sentence) on a date other than the last day of an
     Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, Company shall remit
     to Agent an amount equal to such mandatory prepayment and instruct Agent to
     (i) apply such amount to repay the Revolving Loans or (ii) hold such amount
     in an interest bearing account in Agent's sole dominion and control. On the
     last day of the Interest Period relating to the next-maturing Eurodollar
     Rate Loan, (1) if such mandatory prepayment amount was applied to repay the
     Revolving Loans pursuant to clause (i) above and if such amount would have
     been required to be applied to prepay Term Loans, then Company shall be
     deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan on such last day in an amount
     equal to such mandatory prepayment amount and, so long as the conditions
     set forth in subsection 4.2 have been satisfied, each Lender shall make its
     Pro Rata Share of Revolving Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such
     mandatory prepayment amount (which proceeds shall be made available to
     Agent) and the proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be applied by

                                       62
<PAGE>

          Agent (and Company hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to apply such
          proceeds) to the prepayment of Term Loans in the same manner as the
          mandatory prepayment amount would have been applied had such mandatory
          prepayment amount been made without the operation of the immediately
          preceding sentence, and (2) if such mandatory prepayment amount was
          held in an interest bearing account pursuant to clause (ii) above,
          then Agent shall apply the amounts held by it in such account to the
          prepayment of such maturing Eurodollar Rate Loan and Agent shall
          notify Company of the application of such amounts. Upon the direction
          of Company, Agent may apply any earnings on amounts held in such
          account to the payment of accrued interest on such Eurodollar Rate
          Loan or shall release such earnings to Company.

    C.  General Provisions Regarding Payments.

               --------------------------

     free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to Agent not later than
     1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date due at the Funding and Payment
     Office for the account of Lenders. Funds received by Agent after that time
     on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by Company on the next
     succeeding Business Day. In order to effect timely payment of any interest,
     fees, commissions or other amounts due hereunder, Company hereby authorizes
     Agent to request Daily Funding Lender to make Revolving Loans for its own
     account (subject to settlement pursuant to subsection 2.1D) in a principal
     amount equal to such interest, fees, commissions or other amounts; provided
                                                                        --------
     that Agent shall not have the right to request such Revolving Loans if,
     after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, (a) the aggregate outstanding
     principal amount of Revolving Loans would exceed the Revolving Loan
     Commitments then in effect minus the Letter of Credit Usage, or (b) the
                                -----
     Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments would exceed the Revolving
     Borrowing Base then in effect. Daily Funding Lender shall make the amount
     of such Revolving Loans (which shall be made as Base Rate Loans) available
     to Agent, in same day funds, at the Funding and Payment Office, not later
     than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date requested by Agent, and Company
     and Lenders hereby authorize Agent, whether or not the conditions specified
     in subsection 4.2 have been satisfied or waived, to apply the proceeds of
     such Revolving Loans directly to the payment of such unpaid interest, fees,
     commissions or other amounts. Company hereby agrees that, upon the funding
     of any such Revolving Loans by Daily Funding Lender in accordance with the
     provisions of this subsection 2.4C(i), Company shall have effected
     Revolving Loans hereunder, which Revolving Loans shall for all purposes of
     this Agreement be deemed to have been made by Daily Funding Lender pursuant
     to and in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.1C(ii). Agent
     shall deliver prompt notice to Company of the amount of Revolving Loans
     made pursuant to this subsection 2.4C together with copies of all invoices
     or other statements

                                       63
<PAGE>

     evidencing the fees, commissions or other amounts due hereunder (other than
     interest) paid with the proceeds of such Revolving Loans; provided that
                                                               --------
     Agent shall give notice to Company five days in advance of the making of
     any such Revolving Loans for the payment of any amounts owed under
     subsection 10.2 together with copies of all invoices or other statements
     evidencing such amounts. In addition, Company hereby authorizes Agent to
     charge its accounts with Agent in order to cause timely payment to be made
     to Agent of all principal, interest, fees and expenses due hereunder
     (subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for that
     purpose).

               (ii)   Application of Payments to Principal and Interest. Except
                      -------------------------------------------------
     as provided in subsection 2.2C, all payments in respect of the principal
     amount of any Loan shall include payment of accrued interest on the
     principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in
     any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest is
     due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment
     of interest before application to principal.

               (iii)  Apportionment of Payments. Aggregate principal and
                      -------------------------
     interest payments in respect of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be
     apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such payments relate, in
     each case proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares of such
     Loans; provided that (i) payments of principal in respect of the Revolving
            --------
     Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii)(h) shall be applied to reduce the
     outstanding Revolving Loans of Daily Funding Lender (subject to settlement
     pursuant to subsection 2.1D) prior to application to the outstanding
     Revolving Loans of any other Lender and (ii) payments of interest in
     respect of Revolving Loans which are Base Rate Loans shall be apportioned
     ratably among Lenders in proportion to the average daily amount of such
     Base Rate Loans of each Lender outstanding during the period in which such
     interest shall have accrued. Agent shall promptly distribute to each
     Lender, at its primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate
     signature page hereof or at such other address as such Lender may request,
     its Pro Rata Share of all such payments received by Agent in respect of
     Loans and the commitment fees of such Lender when received by Agent
     pursuant to subsection 2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
     this subsection 2.4C(iii), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection
     2.6C, any Notice of Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected
     Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro
     Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Agent shall give effect thereto in
     apportioning payments received thereafter.

               (iv)   Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment to be made
                      -------------------------
     hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day,
     such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
     extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of
     interest hereunder or of the commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be.

                                       64
<PAGE>

              (v)    Notation of Payment. Each Lender agrees that before
                     -------------------
       disposing of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than by
       granting participations therein), that Lender will make a notation
       thereon of all Loans evidenced by that Note and all principal payments
       previously made thereon and of the date to which interest thereon has
       been paid; provided that the failure to make (or any error in the making
                  --------
       of) a notation of any Loan made under such Note shall not limit or
       otherwise affect the obligations of Company hereunder or under such Note
       with respect to any Loan or any payments of principal or interest on such
       Note.

       D.  Application of Proceeds of Collateral and Payments after Event of
Default.

       Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default,
(a) all payments received on account of the Obligations, whether from Company,
from any Guarantor or otherwise, shall be applied by Agent against the
Obligations and (b) all proceeds received by Agent in respect of any sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral
under any Collateral Document may, in the discretion of Agent, be held by Agent
as Collateral for, and/or (then or at any time thereafter) applied in full or in
part by Agent against, the applicable Secured Obligations (as defined in such
Collateral Document), in each case in the following order of priority:

               (i)   to the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale,
       collection or other realization, all other expenses, liabilities and
       advances made or incurred by Agent in connection therewith, and all
       amounts for which Agent is entitled to compensation (including the fees
       described in subsection 2.3), reimbursement and indemnification under any
       Loan Document and all advances made by Agent thereunder for the account
       of the applicable Loan Party, and to the payment of all costs and
       expenses paid or incurred by Agent in connection with the Loan Documents,
       all in accordance with subsections 9.4, 10.2 and 10.3 and the other terms
       of this Agreement and the Loan Documents;

               (ii)  thereafter, to the extent of any excess such proceeds, to
       the payment of all other Obligations for the ratable benefit of the
       holders thereof (subject to the provisions of subsection 2.4C(ii)
       hereof); and

               (iii) thereafter, to the extent of any excess such proceeds, to
       the payment to or upon the order of such Loan Party or to whosoever may
       be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent
       jurisdiction may direct.

  2.5  Use of Proceeds.
       ---------------

       A.  Initial Loans.  The proceeds of the Term Loans, together with up to
           -------------
$63,500,000 in proceeds of the initial Revolving Loans and the proceeds of the
Equity Financing from the Preferred Stock Purchase, shall be applied by Company
to refinance the Existing Credit Agreement, to repurchase 165 units of the
Contico Preferred Units on the Closing Date pursuant to the Contico Preferred
Unit Repurchase Agreement, and to pay related Transaction Costs.

                                       65
<PAGE>

               B.  Other Revolving Loans. The proceeds of any other Revolving
                   ---------------------
Loans shall be applied by Company for the issuance of Letters of Credit and
working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include the
making of intercompany loans to any of Company's Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries, in
accordance with subsection 7.1(iv) for their own general corporate purposes.

               C.  Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any
                   ------------------
borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the application of
such proceeds to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board
or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates
of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

          2.6  Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans.
               ---------------------------------------------------

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate
Loans as to the matters covered:

               A. Determination of Applicable Interest Rate. As soon as
practicable after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate
Determination Date, Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest
rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is
then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give
notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and
each Lender.

               B. Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In the event
that Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate
Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by reason of
circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market adequate and fair means
do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the
basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, Agent shall on
such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
Company and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be
made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Agent
notifies Company and such Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to the Loans in respect of
which such determination was made shall be deemed to be for a Base Rate Loan.

               C. Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans. In
the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination
shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall be
made only after consultation with Company and Agent) that the making,
maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become unlawful
as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty,
governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any
such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the
force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful)
or (ii) has become impracticable, or would

                                       66
<PAGE>

cause such Lender material hardship, as a result of contingencies occurring
after the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect the
interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in that market, then,
and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "Affected Lender" and it shall on
that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
Company and Agent of such determination (which notice Agent shall promptly
transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected
Lender to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to
the extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar
Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as
(or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan (c) the Affected
Lender's obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the
"Affected Loans"), shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration
of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when
required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into
Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates
to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice
of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company shall have the
option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, to rescind such Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation as to all Lenders by giving
notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Agent of such
rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its
determination as described above (which notice of rescission Agent shall
promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C shall affect the obligation
of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to
convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

          D.  Compensation For Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods.
Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by that Lender
pursuant to subsection 2.8 (which request shall set forth the basis for
requesting such amounts), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities
(including, without limitation, any interest paid by that Lender to lenders of
funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans and, without
duplication, any loss, expense or liability sustained by that Lender in
connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds) which that
Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by that Lender)
a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a
conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a
date specified therefor in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or a telephonic
request for conversion or continuation, (ii) if any prepayment (including any
prepayment or conversion occasioned by the circumstances described in subsection
2.6C) or other principal payment or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate
Loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to
that Loan, (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not
made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by Company, or (iv)
as a consequence of any other default by Company in the repayment of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement.

                                       67
<PAGE>

               E.  Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to subsection 2.8B,
any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the
account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of that
Lender.

               F.  Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection 2.6 and
under subsection 2.7A shall be made as though that Lender had funded each of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing
interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar
Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period,
whether or not its Eurodollar Rate Loans had been funded in such manner.

               G.  Eurodollar Rate Loans After Default. After the occurrence of
and during the continuation of a Potential Event of Default or an Event of
Default, (i) Company may not elect to have a Loan be made or maintained as, or
converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan after the expiration of any Interest Period
then in effect for that Loan and (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection
2.6D, any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by
Company with respect to a requested borrowing or conversion/continuation that
has not yet occurred shall be deemed for a Base Rate Loan or, if the conditions
to making a Loan set forth in subsection 4.2 cannot then be satisfied, to be
rescinded by Company.

        2.7  Increased Costs; Taxes; Capital Adequacy.
             ----------------------------------------

               A.  Compensation for Increased Costs. Subject to the provisions
of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters
covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (including any Issuing Lender)
shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the
introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order),
or any determination of a court or other Government Authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other Government Authority (whether or not having the force of
law):

                         (i)   subjects such Lender to any additional Tax with
               respect to this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder
               (including with respect to issuing or maintaining any Letters of
               Credit or purchasing or maintaining any participations therein or
               maintaining any Commitment hereunder) or any payments to such
               Lender of principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable
               hereunder;

                         (ii)  imposes, modifies or holds applicable any
               reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or
               similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
               liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or
               other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
               any office of such Lender (other than any such reserve or other
               requirements with respect to

                                       68
<PAGE>

          Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted
          Eurodollar Rate); or

               (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to
          Taxes) on or affecting such Lender or its obligations hereunder or the
          interbank Eurodollar market;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Loans or Commitments or agreeing to
issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase,
purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Lender with respect thereto; then, in any such
case, Company shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the statement
referred to in subsection 2.8A, such additional amount or amounts (in the form
of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or
otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as may be
necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in
amounts received or receivable hereunder; provided that Company shall not be
                                          --------
required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this subsection for any increased
cost or reduction in respect of a period occurring more than six months prior to
the date that such Lender notifies Company of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor unless the circumstances giving rise to such increased
cost or reduction became applicable retroactively, in which case no such time
limitation shall apply so long as such Lender requests compensation within six
months from the date such circumstances become applicable.

          B.   Taxes.

                    (i)  Payments to Be Free and Clear. Except as otherwise
                         -----------------------------
          provided in this subsection 2.7B, all sums payable by Company under
          this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be paid free and
          clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of, any
          Tax.

                    (ii) Grossing-up of Payments. If Company or any other Person
                         -----------------------
          is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of
          any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by Company to Agent or any
          Lender under any of the Loan Documents:

                         (a)  Company shall notify Agent of any such requirement
                    or any change in any such requirement as soon as Company
                    becomes aware of it;

                         (b)  Company shall pay any such Tax when such Tax is
                    due, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is
                    imposed on Company) for its own account or (if that
                    liability is imposed on Agent or such Lender, as the case
                    may be) on behalf of and in the name of Agent or such
                    Lender;

                         (c)  the sum payable by Company in respect of which the
                    relevant deduction, withholding or payment on account of
                    such Tax is required shall be increased to the extent
                    necessary to ensure that, after the making of that
                    deduction, withholding or payment, Agent or such Lender, as
                    the case may be, receives on the due date a sum net of such
                    Tax equal to what

                                       69
<PAGE>

                    it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or
                    payment been required or made; and

                          (d)  within 30 days after paying any sum from which it
                    is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and
                    within 30 days after the due date of payment of any Tax
                    which it is required by clause (b) above to pay, Company
                    shall deliver to Agent evidence satisfactory to the other
                    affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment
                    and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or
                    other authority;

          provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid
          --------
to any Lender or to Agent on behalf of Agent or any Lender under clause (c)
above (i) with respect to any Tax required to be deducted or withheld on the
basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption a Non-US
Lender chooses to transmit with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY pursuant
to subsection 2.7B(iii)(b)(2) and (ii) except to the extent that any change
after the date on which such Lender became a Lender (other than a change under
the applicable law enacted or promulgated, but not in effect, as of such date,
as long as such change becomes effective within one year of such date) in any
such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as is mentioned therein
shall result in an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding or
payment from that in effect on the date on which such Lender became a Lender, in
respect of payments to such Lender.

                    (iii) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.
                          -----------------------------------------------

                          (a)  Each Lender that is organized under the laws of
                    any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state
                    or other political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this
                    subsection 2.7B(iii), a "Non-US Lender") shall deliver to
                    Agent and to Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in

                    Code or the regulations issued thereunder to establish that
                    such Non-US Lender is not subject to United States
                    withholding tax with respect to any payments to such Non-US
                    Lender of interest payable under any of the Loan Documents.

                         (b)  Each Non-US Lender, to the extent it does not act
                    or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any
                    portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any
                    of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical
                    participation by such Lender), shall deliver to Agent and to
                    Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of
                    each Non-US Lender listed on the signatures pages hereof),
                    on or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant
                    to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Non-
                    US Lender), or on such later date when such Non-US Lender
                    ceases to act for its own account with respect to any
                    portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other
                    times as may be necessary in the determination of Company or

                    statements required to be provided by such Non-US Lender
                    under subsection 2.7B(iii)(a), properly completed and duly
                    executed by such Non-US Lender, to establish the portion of
                    any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such
                    Non-US Lender acts for its own account that is not subject

                    copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any
                    successor forms) properly completed and duly executed by
                    such Non-US Lender, together with any information, if any,
                    such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any
                    other certificate or statement of exemption required under
                    the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued
                    thereunder, to establish that such Lender is not acting for
                    its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums
                    payable to such Non-US Lender.

                         (c)  Each Non-US Lender hereby agrees, from time to
                    time after the initial delivery by such Lender of any forms,
                    certificates or other evidence under this subsection
                    2.7B(iii), whenever a lapse in time or change in
                    circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
                    evidence so delivered obsolete or inaccurate in any material
                    respect, that such Non-US Lender shall promptly (1) deliver
                    to Agent and to Company two original copies of renewals,
                    amendments or additional or successor forms, properly
                    completed and duly executed by such Non-US Lender, together
                    with any other certificate or statement of exemption
                    required in order to confirm or establish that such Non-US
                    Lender is not subject to United States withholding tax with
                    respect to payments to such Non-US Lender under the Loan
                    Documents and, if applicable, that such Lender does not act
                    for its own account with respect to any portion of such
                    payment, or (2) notify Agent and Company of its inability to
                    deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence.

                         (d)  Company shall not be required to pay any
                    additional amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of
                    subsection 2.7B(ii) if such Non-US Lender shall have failed
                    to satisfy the requirements of clause (a), (b) or (c)(1) of
                    this subsection 2.7B(iii); provided that if such Non-US
                                               --------
                    Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of subsection
                    2.7B(iii)(a) on the date such Non-US Lender became a Lender,
                    nothing in this subsection 2.7B(iii)(d) shall relieve
                    Company of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to
                    subsection 2.7B(ii)(c) in the event that, as a result of any
                    change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
                    regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
                    administration or application thereof, such Non-US Lender is
                    no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates
                    or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact
                    that such Lender is not subject to withholding as described
                    in subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).

                    (iv) Tax Refund. If a Lender or Agent determines in good
                         ----------
               faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting a Tax with
               respect to which Company has paid an additional amount under this
               subsection 2.7B or subsection 2.7A, such Lender or Agent, as
               applicable, shall notify Company in writing of its determination
               and, if requested in writing by Company, cooperate with Company
               (but shall have no obligation to disclose any confidential
               information, unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender or
               Agent, as applicable, have been made to preserve the confidential
               nature of such information) in challenging such Tax at Company's
               expense (it being understood and agreed that no Lender or Agent
               shall have any obligation to contest, or any responsibility for
               contesting, any Tax). If a Lender shall become aware that it is
               entitled to receive a refund (whether by way of a direct payment
               or by offset) in respect of a Tax paid by Company, it shall
               promptly notify Company of the availability of such refund
               (unless it was made aware of such refund by Company) and shall,
               within 45 days after the receipt of a request from Company, apply
               for such refund at Company's sole expense. If any Lender or
               Agent, as applicable, receives a refund (whether by way of a
               direct payment or by offset) of any Tax with respect to which
               Company has paid an additional amount under this subsection 2.7B
               or subsection 2.7A which, in the reasonable good faith judgment
               of such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, is allocable to such
               payment made under this subsection 2.7B or subsection 2.7A, the
               amount of such refund (together with any interest thereon
               received by such Lender or Agent from the Government Authority
               that imposed the Tax being refunded, but net of all reasonable
               out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or Agent) shall be paid to
               Company if (i) payment of the Tax being refunded has been made in
               full as and when required pursuant to this subsection 2.7B or
               subsection 2.7A and (ii) Company agrees in writing to repay the
               amount of such Refund, together with interest thereon, to the
               applicable Lender or Agent in the event such Lender or Agent is
               required to repay such refund to such Government Authority.

               C.   Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the
date hereof of any law, rule or

                                       72
<PAGE>

regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding capital adequacy, or any change
therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Government
Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Lender with any guideline, request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Government
Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a
consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender's Loans or Commitments or
Letters of Credit or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with
respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit to a level below that which such
Lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking
into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation
with regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within five Business
Days after receipt by Company from such Lender of the statement referred to in
subsection 2.8A, Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an
after-tax basis for such reduction; provided that Company shall not be required
                                    --------
to compensate a Lender pursuant to this subsection for any reduction in respect
of a period occurring more than six months prior to the date that such Lender
notifies Company of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor
unless the circumstances giving rise to such reduction become applicable
retroactively, in which case no such time limitation shall apply so long as such
Lender requests compensation within six months from the date such circumstances
become applicable.

     2.8  Statement of Lenders; Obligation of Lenders and Issuing Lenders to
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitigate.
--------

               A.   Statements. Each Lender claiming compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to subsection 2.6D, 2.7 or 2.8B shall deliver to Company
(with a copy to Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis of the calculation of such compensation or reimbursement, which
statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent
manifest error.

               B.   Mitigation. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, as
promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender
responsible for administering the Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or
Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event
or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender to become an
Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive
payments under subsection 2.7, use reasonable effort to make, issue, fund or
maintain the Commitments of such Lender or the Affected Loans or Letters of
Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of
credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender, if (i) as a result thereof the
circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease
to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid
to such Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 would be materially
reduced and (ii) as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in its sole
discretion, such action would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or
Issuing Lender; provided that such Lender or Issuing Lender will not be
                --------
obligated to utilize such other lending or letter of credit office pursuant to
this subsection 2.8B unless Company agrees to pay all incremental expenses
incurred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as a result of utilizing such other
lending or letter of credit office as described above.

     2.9  Replacement of a Lender.
          -----------------------

               If Company receives a statement of amounts due pursuant to
subsection 2.8A from a Lender or a Lender becomes an Affected Lender (any such
Lender, a "Subject Lender"), so long as (i) no Potential Event of Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and Company has obtained
a commitment from another Lender or an Eligible Assignee to purchase at par the
Subject Lender's Loans and assume the Subject Lender's Commitments and all other
obligations of the Subject Lender hereunder, (ii) such Lender is not an Issuing
Lender with respect to any Letters of Credit outstanding (unless all such
Letters of Credit are terminated or arrangements acceptable to such Issuing
Lender (such as a "back-to-back" letter of credit) are made) and (iii), if
applicable, the Subject Lender is unwilling to withdraw the notice delivered to
Company pursuant to subsection 2.8 upon 10 days prior written notice to the
Subject Lender and Agent, Company may require the Subject Lender to assign all
of its Loans and Commitments to such other Lender, Lenders, Eligible Assignee or
Eligible Assignees pursuant to the provisions of subsection 10.1B; provided
                                                                   --------
that, prior to or concurrently with such replacement, (1) the Subject Lender
shall have received payment in full of all principal, interest, fees and other
amounts, including all amounts under subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and/or 2.8B (if
applicable) through such date of replacement and a release from its obligations
under the Loan Documents, (2) the processing fee required to be paid by
subsection 10.1B(i) shall have been paid to Agent, and (3) all of the
requirements for such assignment contained in subsection 10.1B, including,
without limitation, the consent of Agent (if required) and the receipt by Agent
of an executed Assignment Agreement and other supporting documents, have been
fulfilled.

          actions as may reasonably be necessary to cause all payments in
          respect of such Person's Accounts to be made directly to a Lock Box
          or, in the case of account debtors of Contico in the United Kingdom,
          to a Deposit Account of Contico that is subject to a charge pursuant
          to the U.K. Subsidiary Debenture. Company shall cause Woods and Glit
          to establish Lock Boxes and Lock Box Accounts and enter into Lock Box
          Agreements within 90 days of the Closing Date and shall cause all
          payments in respect of Accounts of Woods and Glit on and after 180
          days after the Closing Date to be made directly to a Lock Box.

                    (ii)  Company shall, or shall cause each of its Domestic
          Subsidiaries to, and, as soon as possible and in any event on and
          after 90 days after the Closing Date, shall cause Woods and Glit to,
          direct the Lock Box Bank (or other authorized representatives
          designated by Agent), at least once on each Business Day, to retrieve
          all checks and other instruments delivered to a Lock Box and, as
          promptly as possible on the same Business Day so retrieved, to endorse
          for payment and deposit each such check or other instrument in the
          Lock Box Account related to such Lock Box. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, from and after such time as Agent shall have notified
          Company of its election to exercise its rights under this subsection
          2.10B(ii), Company shall not, and shall not permit its Domestic
          Subsidiaries, Woods or Glit to, retrieve any items from any Lock Box
          unless accompanied by a representative of Agent, and Company hereby
          appoints Agent or any of its designees as Company' attorneys-in-fact
          with powers, upon notification by Agent as aforesaid, to (a) access
          all Lock Boxes and (b) endorse for payment any checks or other
          instruments representing payment in respect of any Accounts of such
          Persons that are delivered to any Lock Box. All acts of said attorneys
          or designees are hereby ratified and approved, and said attorneys or
          designees shall not be liable for any acts of omission or commission
          (other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful
          misconduct as determined in a final order by a court of competent
          jurisdiction), nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or
          law. The power of attorney set forth in this subsection 2.10B(ii) is
          irrevocable until all Obligations shall have been paid in full and the
          Commitments shall have terminated.

                    (iii) In the event that Company or any of its Domestic
          Subsidiaries, Woods or Glit receives any check, cash, note or other
          instrument representing payment of an Account (other than any item
          delivered to a Lock Box), Company shall, or shall cause such
          Subsidiary to, hold such item in trust for Agent and

                                       76
<PAGE>

          shall, as soon as practicable (and in any event within one Business
          Day) after receipt thereof, cause such item to be deposited into a
          Lock Box Account with any necessary endorsements.

               (iv) Company hereby agrees, from and after such time, if any, as
          Agent shall have notified Company in writing that the provisions of
          this subsection 2.10B(iv) are to become effective until such later
          time, if any, as Agent shall have notified Company in writing that
          such provisions are no longer to be effective, not to deposit any
          monies into the Lock Box Accounts or to Concentration Accounts or to
          otherwise permit any monies to be deposited into any of such accounts,
          except payments received in respect of Company's Accounts.

          C.   Transfer of Amounts Deposited in the Lock Box Accounts to the
Concentration Accounts. Company shall cause all amounts deposited in each Lock
Box Account to be automatically transferred on each Business Day to the
applicable Concentration Account in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Lock Box Agreement.

          D.   Transfer of Amounts Deposited in the Concentration Accounts and
Other Deposit Accounts to the BTCo Account. Company shall cause all amounts
deposited in each Deposit Account of Contico in the United Kingdom to be
automatically transferred to a Concentration Account or the BTCo Account upon
the giving of notice by Agent (which notice shall be given only upon the
occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of
Default) or if any such Deposit Account has amounts exceeding the levels set
forth in subsection 2.10A(iii)(c)(2). Company shall cause all amounts deposited
in each Deposit Account of Woods and Glit (other than a Lock Box Account) to be
automatically transferred to a Concentration Account or the BTCo Account upon
the giving of notice by Agent (which notice shall be given only upon the
occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of
Default) or if all Deposit Accounts of Glit have an aggregate amount exceeding
$1,500,000 at any time (but only to the extent of such excess) or if all Deposit
Accounts of Woods have an aggregate amount exceeding $3,000,000 at any time (but
only to the extent of such excess). Company shall cause all amounts deposited in
each Concentration Account to be automatically transferred to the BTCo Account
on each Business Day. Company shall cause all amounts deposited in any other
Deposit Account (including zero balance accounts and other disbursement accounts
which are subject to Blocked Account Agreements which do not require an
automatic daily transfer to the BTCo Account) to be transferred to the BTCo
Account on each Business Day upon giving of notice by Agent (which notice shall
be given only upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default or a
Potential Event of Default). Any amounts so transferred to the BTCo Account
first shall be applied as provided in subsection 2.4B(iii)(h) to the extent
-----
therein provided and thereafter, so long as no Event of Default or Potential
                     ----------
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall be available for
disbursement to the applicable Loan Parties for working capital and other
general corporate purposes.

          E.   Treatment of Accounts. Company shall not, without Agent's prior
written consent, grant any extension of the time of payment of any Account,
compromise or settle any Account for less than the full amount thereof, release,
in whole or in part, any person or property

                                       77
<PAGE>

liable for the payment thereof, or allow any credit or discount whatsoever
thereon, except, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, in accordance
with their usual and customary business practices.

               F.   Company to Provide Information. Company shall, at such
intervals as Agent may reasonably request, furnish such statements, schedules
and/or information as Agent may request relating to Company's and its
Subsidiaries' Accounts and the collection, deposit and transfer of payments in
respect thereof, including, without limitation, all invoices evidencing such
Accounts.

SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT

     3.1 Issuance of Letters of Credit and Lenders' Purchase of Participations
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Therein.
-------

               A.   Letters of Credit. In addition to Company requesting that
Lenders make Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(ii), Company may
request, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1, from time to
time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the 30th day prior
to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, that one or more Revolving
Lenders issue Letters of Credit payable on a sight basis for the account of
Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes specified in the definitions
of Commercial Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations
and warranties of Company herein set forth, any one or more Lenders may, but
(except as provided in subsection 3.1B(ii)) shall not be obligated to, issue
such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1;
provided that Company shall not request that any Revolving Lender issue (and no
--------
Revolving Lender shall issue):

                    (i)   any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
               issuance, the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments
               would exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect;

                    (ii)  any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
               issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $15,000,000;

                    (iii) any Letter of Credit for the account of Company or a
               Subsidiary Guarantor if, after giving effect to such issuance,
               the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments would exceed
               the Revolving Borrowing Base then in effect;

                    (iv)  any Standby Letter of Credit having an expiration date
               later than the earlier of (a) five Business Days prior to the
               Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and (b) the date which
               is one year from the date of issuance of such Standby Letter of
               Credit; provided that the immediately preceding clause (b) shall
                       --------
               not prevent any Issuing Lender from agreeing that a Standby
               Letter of Credit will automatically be extended for one or more
               successive periods not to exceed one year each unless such
               Issuing Lender elects not to extend for any such additional
               period; and provided, further that such Issuing Lender shall
                           --------  -------
               elect not to extend such Standby Letter of Credit if it has
               knowledge that an Event of Default


                                       78
<PAGE>

          has occurred and is continuing (and has not been waived in accordance
          with subsection 10.6) at the time such Issuing Lender must elect
          whether or not to allow such extension; or

               (v)  any Commercial Letter of Credit having an expiration date
          (a) later than the earlier of (1) the date which is 30 days prior to
          the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and (2) the date which
          is 180 days from the date of issuance of such Commercial Letter of
          Credit or (b) that is otherwise unacceptable to the applicable Issuing
          Lender in its reasonable discretion.

          B.   Mechanics of Issuance.

               (i)  Notice of Issuance. Whenever Company desires the issuance of
                    ------------------
          a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to Agent a Request for Issuance
          of Letter of Credit substantially in the form of Exhibit III annexed
                                                           -----------
          hereto no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least three
          Business Days (in the case of Standby Letters of Credit) or five
          Business Days (in the case of Commercial Letters of Credit), or in
          each case, such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing
          Lender in any particular instance, in advance of the proposed date of
          issuance. The Issuing Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may
          require changes in the text of the proposed Letter of Credit or any
          documents described in or attached to the Request for Issuance of
          Letter of Credit. In furtherance of the provisions of subsection 10.8,
          and not in limitation thereof, Company may submit Requests for
          Issuance of Letter of Credit by telefacsimile and Agent and Issuing
          Lenders may rely and act upon any such Request for Issuance of Letter
          of Credit without receiving an original signed copy thereof.

                    Company shall notify the applicable Issuing Lender (and
          Agent, if Agent is not such Issuing Lender) prior to the issuance of
          any Letter of Credit in the event that any of the matters to which
          Company is required to certify in the applicable Request for Issuance
          of Letter of Credit is no longer true and correct as of the proposed
          date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, and upon the issuance of
          any Letter of Credit Company shall be deemed to have re-certified, as
          of the date of such issuance, as to the matters to which Company is
          required to certify in the applicable Request for Issuance of Letter
          of Credit.

               (ii) Determination of Issuing Lender. Upon receipt by Agent of a
                    -------------------------------
          Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit pursuant to subsection
          3.1B(i) requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, in the event
          Agent elects to issue such Letter of Credit, Agent shall promptly so
          notify Company, and Agent shall be the Issuing Lender with respect
          thereto. In the event that Agent, in its sole discretion, elects not
          to issue such Letter of Credit, Agent shall promptly so notify
          Company, whereupon Company may request any other Revolving Lender to
          issue such Letter of Credit by delivering to such Revolving Lender a
          copy of the applicable Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit. Any
          Revolving Lender so requested to issue such Letter of Credit shall
          promptly, and in any event one Business Day prior to the issuance
          thereof, notify Company and Agent whether or not, in its sole

                                       79
<PAGE>

          discretion, it has elected to issue such Letter of Credit, and such
          Revolving Lender shall promptly, and in any event one Business Day
          prior to the effectiveness of any amendment to such Letter of Credit,
          notify Company and Agent of any such amendment, and any such Revolving
          Lender which so elects to issue such Letter of Credit shall be the
          Issuing Lender with respect thereto. In the event that all other
          Revolving Lenders shall have declined to issue such Letter of Credit,
          notwithstanding the prior election of Agent not to issue such Letter
          of Credit, Agent shall be obligated to issue such Letter of Credit and
          shall be the Issuing Lender with respect thereto, notwithstanding the
          fact that the Letter of Credit Usage with respect to such Letter of
          Credit and with respect to all other Letters of Credit issued by
          Agent, when aggregated with Agent's outstanding Revolving Loans, may
          exceed Agent's Revolving Loan Commitment then in effect; provided that
                                                                   --------
          Agent shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit denominated
          in a foreign currency which in the judgment of Agent is not readily
          and freely available.

               (iii)  Issuance of Letter of Credit. Upon satisfaction or waiver
                      ----------------------------
          (in accordance with subsection 10.6) of the conditions set forth in
          subsection 4.3, the Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Letter of
          Credit in accordance with the Issuing Lender's standard operating
          procedures.

               (iv)   Notification to Lenders. Upon the issuance of or amendment
                      -----------------------
          to any Standby Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender shall
          promptly notify Company and Agent, in writing, of such issuance or
          amendment and such notice must be accompanied by a copy of such
          issuance or amendment. Promptly after receipt of such notice, Agent
          shall notify each other Revolving Lender of such issuance or
          amendment, and if requested by any Revolving Lender, Agent shall
          furnish such Revolving Lender with a copy of such issuance or
          amendment. With regard to Commercial Letters of Credit, on the first
          Business Day of each week the applicable Issuing Lender shall provide
          Agent, by facsimile, with a report detailing such Issuing Lender's
          daily aggregate outstandings for the previous week.

          C.   Revolving Lenders' Purchase of Participations in Letters of
Credit. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably purchased from
the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and any drawings
honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share
of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn
thereunder.

    3.2  Letter of Credit Fees.
         ---------------------

          Company agrees to pay the following amounts with respect to
Letters of Credit issued hereunder:

                    (i)  with respect to each Standby Letter of Credit, (a) a
          fronting fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for
          its own account, equal to the

                                       80
<PAGE>

          greater of (X) $500 and (Y) 0.25% per annum of the daily amount
          available to be drawn under such Standby Letter of Credit and (b) a
          letter of credit fee, payable to Agent for the account of Revolving
          Lenders, equal to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin per annum for
          Revolving Loans multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn
                          -------------
          under such Standby Letter of Credit, in each case payable in arrears
          on and to (but excluding) the first Business Day of each March, June,
          September and December of each year and computed on the basis of a
          360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed;

               (ii)   with respect to each Commercial Letter of Credit, (a) a
          fronting fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for
          its own account, equal to the greater of (X) $500 and (Y) 0.25% per
          annum of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Commercial
          Letter of Credit and (b) a letter of credit fee, payable to Agent for
          the account of Revolving Lenders, equal to the applicable Eurodollar
          Rate Margin per annum for Revolving Loans multiplied by the daily
                                                    -------------
          amount available to be drawn under such Commercial Letter of Credit,
          in each case payable in arrears on and to (but excluding) the first
          Business Day of each March, June, September and December of each year
          and computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of
          days elapsed; and

               (iii)  with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of
          each Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder
          (without duplication of the fees payable under clause (i) above),
          documentary and processing charges, payable directly to the applicable
          Issuing Lender for its own account, in accordance with such Issuing
          Lender's standard schedule for such charges in effect at the time of
          such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be.

For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clauses (i) and (ii) of this
subsection 3.2, (1) the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of
determination and (2) any amount described in such clauses which is denominated
in a currency other than Dollars shall be valued based on the applicable
Exchange Rate for such currency as of the applicable date of determination.
Promptly upon receipt by Agent of any amount described in clauses (i)(b) and
(ii)(b) of this subsection 3.2, Agent shall distribute to each Revolving Lender
its Pro Rata Share of such amount.

     3.3  Drawings and Reimbursement of Amounts Drawn Under Letters of Credit.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------

          A.   Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to Drawings. In
determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to examine the
documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as to
ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

          B.   Reimbursement by Company of Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.
In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter
of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately notify Company and
Agent, and Company shall

                                       81
<PAGE>

reimburse such Issuing Lender (whether such Letter of Credit was issued for the
account of Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor) on or before the Business Day
immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the
"Reimbursement Date") in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in the case of a
payment under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a currency other than
Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) and
in same day funds equal to the amount of such payment; provided that, anything
                                                       --------
contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Company
shall have notified Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the date such drawing is honored that Company intends to reimburse
such Issuing Lender for the amount of such payment with funds other than the
proceeds of Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely
Notice of Borrowing to Agent requesting Revolving Lenders to make Revolving
Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars
(which amount, in the case of a payment under a Letter of Credit which is
denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference
to the applicable Exchange Rate) equal to the amount of such payment and (ii)
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection
4.2B, Revolving Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans
that are Base Rate Loans in the amount of such payment, the proceeds of which
shall be applied directly by Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the
amount of such payment; and provided, further that if for any reason proceeds of
                            --------  -------
Revolving Loans are not received by such Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement
Date in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, Company shall reimburse
such Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the
excess of the amount of such payment over the aggregate amount of such Revolving
Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be
deemed to relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to make Revolving
Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Company shall
retain any and all rights it may have against any Revolving Lender resulting
from the failure of such Revolving Lender to make such Revolving Loans under
this subsection 3.3B.

          C.  Payment by Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts Paid Under Letters of
Credit.
               (i)  Payment by Revolving Lenders. In the event that Company
                    ----------------------------
          shall fail for any reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided
          in subsection 3.3B in an amount (calculated, in the case of a payment
          under a Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars,
          by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) equal to the amount of
          any payment by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by
          it, such Issuing Lender shall promptly notify each other Lender of the
          unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such other
          Revolving Lender's respective participation therein based on such
          Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share. Each Revolving Lender shall make
          available to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective
          participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of such
          Issuing Lender specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 Noon
          (New York City time) on the first business day (under the laws of the
          jurisdiction in which such office of such Issuing Lender is located)
          after the date notified by such Issuing Lender. In the event that any
          Revolving Lender fails to make available to such Issuing Lender on
          such business day the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation
          in such Letter of Credit

          as provided in this subsection 3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be
          entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender
          together with interest thereon at the rate customarily used by such
          Issuing Lender for the correction of errors among banks for three
          Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this
          subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender
          to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such
          Revolving Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection
          3.3C in the event that it is determined by the final judgment of a
          court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a
          Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender in respect of which payment
          was made by such Revolving Lender constituted gross negligence or
          willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender.

               (ii) Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received From
                    -------------------------------------------------------
          Company. In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by
          -------
          other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any
          portion of any payment by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit
          issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other
          Revolving Lender that has paid all amounts payable by it under
          subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such payment such other Revolving
          Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by such
          Issuing Lender from Company in reimbursement of such payment under the
          Letter of Credit when such payments are received. Any such
          distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender at its primary
          address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page
          hereof or at such other address as such Revolving Lender may request.

          D.   Interest on Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.

               (i)  Payment of Interest by Company. Company agrees to pay to
                    ------------------------------
          each Issuing Lender, with respect to payments under any Letters of
          Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing
          Lender in respect of each such payment from the date a drawing is
          honored to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by Company
          (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving
          Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3B) at a rate equal to (a) for the
          period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the
          Reimbursement Date, the rate then in effect under this Agreement with
          respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (b)
          thereafter, upon notice to Company by Agent, a rate which is 2% per
          annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this
          Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.
          Interest payable pursuant to this subsection 3.3D(i) shall be computed
          on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed
          in the period during which it accrues and shall be payable on demand
          or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing
          under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full.

               (ii) Distribution of Interest Payments by Issuing Lender.
                    ---------------------------------------------------
          Promptly upon receipt by any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest
          pursuant to

                                       83
<PAGE>

          subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a payment under a Letter of Credit
          issued by it, (a) such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other
          Revolving Lender, out of the interest received by such Issuing Lender
          in respect of the period from the date such drawing is honored to but
          excluding the date on which such Issuing Lender is reimbursed for the
          amount of such payment (including any such reimbursement out of the
          proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3B), the amount
          that such other Revolving Lender would have been entitled to receive
          in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in
          respect of such Letter of Credit for such period pursuant to
          subsection 3.2 if no drawing had been honored under such Letter of
          Credit, and (b) in the event such Issuing Lender shall have been
          reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i)
          for all or any portion of such payment, such Issuing Lender shall
          distribute to each other Revolving Lender that has paid all amounts
          payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such payment
          such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest received
          by such Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such payment so
          reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders for the period from the date on
          which such Issuing Lender was so reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders
          to but excluding the date on which such portion of such payment is
          reimbursed by Company. Any such distribution shall be made to a
          Revolving Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on
          the appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address as such
          Revolving Lender may request.

payments under the Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving
Loans made by Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3B and the obligations
of Revolving Lenders under subsection 3.3C(i) shall be unconditional and
irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under all circumstances including any of the following circumstances:

               (i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
          Credit;

               (ii)   the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
          right which Company or any Lender may have at any time against a
          beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons
          for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Lender or
          other Revolving Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a
          Revolving Lender, against Company, whether in connection with this
          Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
          transaction (including any underlying transaction between Company or
          one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any Letter of
          Credit was procured);

               (iii)  any draft or other document presented under any Letter of
          Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in
          any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
          respect;

                                       84
<PAGE>

               (iv)    payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any Letter
          of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which does
          not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

               (v)     any adverse change in the business, operations,
          properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
          Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

               (vi)    any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
          by any party thereto;

               (vii)   any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
          or not similar to any of the foregoing;

               (viii)  the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential Event of
          Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

               (ix)    the fact that such Letter of Credit is issued for the
          account of a Subsidiary Guarantor;

provided, in each case, that payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under the
--------
applicable Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender under the circumstances in question
(as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

     3.5  Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties.
          --------------------------------------------------

          A.   Indemnification.  In addition to amounts payable as provided in
subsection 2.7, Company hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
harmless each Issuing Lender from and against any and all claims, demands,
liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses other than with
respect to taxes (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of
outside counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which such Issuing
Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i)
the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender, other than as a
result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender
as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b)
subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor by such Issuing
Lender of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit issued by
it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under any such
Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or
wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto Government Authority.

          B.   Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties. As between Company and any
Issuing Lender, Company assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or
misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender by, the respective
beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i) the form,
validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of
any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate,

                                       85
<PAGE>

fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of
Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure
of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any
conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors,
omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages,
by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher;
(v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing
under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender, including any act or
omission by a Government Authority specified in subsection 3.5A, and none of the
above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing
Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

               In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B,
any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with
the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender
under any resulting liability to Company.

               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
subsection 3.5, Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against any
Issuing Lender for any liability to the extent arising out of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

     3.6  Subsidiary Guarantors as Account Parties.
          ----------------------------------------

               A.  As agreed from time to time between Company and the
applicable Issuing Lender, any applications for, or reimbursement agreements or
other documents or certificates executed by Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor
in favor of an Issuing Lender relating to the Letters of Credit (collectively,
the "L/C Related Documents") for any Letter of Credit, and other communications
required of Company with respect thereto under this Section 3 (in each case
other than the Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit), may be executed by a
Subsidiary Guarantor of Company (an "L/C Subsidiary") rather than Company. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that a letter of credit issued pursuant to
such L/C-Related Documents shall be a Letter of Credit for all purposes
hereunder, and Company, the applicable Issuing Lender, and the Lenders shall be
obligated with respect thereto hereunder, and Company shall be obligated under
the related L/C-Related Documents, as though Company were the signatory to such
L/C Related Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, Company hereby guarantees
the payment when due, upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all
indebtedness of any L/C Subsidiary to the applicable Issuing Lender, Agent or
any Lender arising under any L/C-Related Document. If any or all of such
indebtedness becomes due and payable, Company unconditionally promises to pay
such indebtedness to Agent, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United
States. The word "indebtedness" as used in this subsection 3.6 shall mean any
and all advances, debts, obligations and liabilities of an L/C Subsidiary, or
any one or more of them, heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or
created, under any L/C-Related

                                       86
<PAGE>

Document, and any and all renewals, extensions or modifications thereof, whether
or not recovery upon such indebtedness may be or hereafter becomes barred by any
statute of limitations, and whether or not such indebtedness may be or hereafter
becomes otherwise unenforceable.

               B.  Company guarantees the payment of any and all indebtedness of
each L/C Subsidiary whether or not due or payable by such L/C Subsidiary upon
(a) the death, dissolution, insolvency or business failure of, or any assignment
for benefit of creditors by, or commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceedings by or against, such
L/C Subsidiary or Company, or (b) the appointment of a receiver for, or the
attachment, restraint or making or levying of any order of court or legal
process affecting, the property of such L/C Subsidiary or Company, and
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to Agent, on demand, in lawful
money of the United States.

               C.  The liability of Company under this subsection 3.6 is
exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the
indebtedness of any L/C Subsidiary, whether executed by Company or by any other
party, and the liability of Company hereunder is not affected or impaired by (a)
any direction of application of payment by any L/C Subsidiary or by any other
party, or (b) any other guaranty or undertaking of Company or of any other party
as to the indebtedness of any L/C Subsidiary, or (c) any payment on or in
reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution,
termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel of any L/C Subsidiary
or Company. To the extent any L/C Subsidiary or Company make any payment to the
applicable Issuing Lender or Agent in connection with the indebtedness, and all
or any part of such payment is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid or paid over to a
trustee, receiver or any other entity, whether in connection with an insolvency
proceeding or otherwise (any such payment is hereinafter referred to as a
"Preferential Payment"), then this guaranty shall continue to be effective or
shall be reinstated, as the case may be, and, to the extent of such payment or
repayment, the indebtedness or part thereof intended to be satisfied by such
Preferential Payment shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as
if said Preferential Payment had not been made.

               D.  The obligations of Company under this subsection 3.6 are
independent of the obligations of the L/C Subsidiaries, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against Company whether or not action is
brought against any L/C Subsidiary and whether or not any L/C Subsidiary be
joined in any such action or actions.

               E.  Company authorizes the applicable Issuing Lenders, without
notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot
be waived), and without affecting or impairing their liability hereunder, from
time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change
the time for payment of, or otherwise change the terms of the indebtedness or
any part thereof, including increase or decrease of the rate of interest
therein; (b) take and hold security for the payment of the indebtedness and
exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; (c) apply such security
and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the applicable Issuing Lender
in its discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute any one or more
endorsers, guarantors, L/C Subsidiaries or other obligors.

                                       87
<PAGE>

               F.  It is not necessary for the applicable Issuing Lender to
inquire into the capacity or powers of any L/C Subsidiary or the officers,
directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and
any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be guaranteed hereunder, and if any L/C Subsidiary is a
partnership, the word "L/C Subsidiary" and "indebtedness" as used herein include
all successor partnerships and liabilities thereof to the applicable Issuing
Lender, Agent, and the Lenders.

               G.  Absent a waiver of such right, Company may have the right to
assert a defense to an action to enforce this guaranty if (a) the applicable
Issuing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders do not proceed against any L/C Subsidiary,
or any security for the indebtedness of any L/C Subsidiary, or pursue any other
remedy in their power that Company cannot pursue, before enforcing this
guaranty, (b) the applicable Issuing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders take any
action, without Company's consent, of the type specified in subsection 3.6C, or
any other action by which the indebtedness of any L/C Subsidiary is altered in
any respect, or the remedies or rights of Company against any L/C Subsidiary or
any other person or any security are impaired, suspended or extinguished, (c)
any L/C Subsidiary is under a legal disability or any L/C Subsidiary has any
other defense to payment of the indebtedness, (d) there is no liability on the
part of any L/C Subsidiary or such liability is limited or ceases for any reason
other than payment of the indebtedness in full, (e) the applicable Lender,
Agent, or any Lender fails to notify Company of information known to them as to
any L/C Subsidiary's financial condition, assets or other circumstances bearing
on repayment of the indebtedness or the nature, scope and extent of the risks
that Company assumes and incurs hereunder (and Company agree that neither the
applicable Issuing Lender, Agent, nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise
Company of any such information), (f) the statute of limitations applicable to
an action to enforce this guaranty has run (and Company agrees that any payment
by any L/C Subsidiary or other circumstance that operates to toll any statute of
limitations as to any L/C Subsidiary shall operate to toll the statute of
limitations as to Company), (g) the applicable Issuing Lender, Agent, or any
Lender fails to make or provide any presentment, demand for performance, or
notice of nonperformance, dishonor, the acceptance of this guaranty, or other
notice, or (h) any election of remedies by the applicable Issuing Lender, Agent,
or any Lender, including any election to proceed by nonjudicial foreclosure on
any security, or any act or omission of the applicable Issuing Lender, Agent, or
any Lender relating to such foreclosure, operates to impair, suspend or
extinguish any right of contribution, subrogation or reimbursement that Company
would otherwise have against any L/C Subsidiary. Company hereby expressly waives
the right to assert any defense described in this subsection 3.6G.

or liabilities relating to Company's use of or reliance on such report, (ii)

Material Adverse Effect, (iv) Company's discovery of any occurrence or condition
on any real property adjoining or in the vicinity of any Facility that could
cause such Facility or any part thereof to be subject to any material
restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, transferability or use thereof under

to, or result in, Environmental Claims that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect or that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on any Governmental Authorization then held by Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) any proposed action to be taken by Company

                                      144
<PAGE>

Lenders, by written notice to Company, declare all or any portion of the amounts
described in clauses (a) through (c) above to be, and the same shall forthwith
become, immediately due and payable, and the obligation of each Lender to make
any Loan, the obligation of Agent to issue any Letter of Credit and the right of

Company, may at their option rescind and annul such acceleration and its
consequences; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default
or Potential Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.  The
provisions of this paragraph are intended merely to bind Lenders to a decision
which may be made at the election of Requisite Lenders and are not intended,
directly or indirectly, to benefit Company, and such provisions shall not at any
time be construed so as to grant Company the right to require Lenders to rescind
or annul any acceleration hereunder or to preclude Agent or Lenders from
exercising any of the rights or remedies available to them under any of the Loan
Documents, even if the conditions set forth in this paragraph are met.

Section 9.  AGENT

     9.1  Appointment.
          -----------

               A.  Appointment of Agent. BTCo is hereby appointed Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. Each Lender hereby authorizes
Agent to act as its agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Agent agrees to act upon the express conditions contained
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable. The provisions of
this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and none of
Holdings, Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its functions and
duties under this Agreement, Agent (other than as provided in subsection 2.1E)
shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be
deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust
with or for Holdings, Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

               B. Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents. It is the
purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no
violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of
banking corporations or associations to transact

                                      145
<PAGE>

business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case
of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in
particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case
Agent deems that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it
may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any
of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that Agent appoint an
additional individual or institution as a separate trustee, co-trustee,
collateral agent or collateral co-agent (any such additional individual or
institution being referred to herein individually as a "Supplemental Collateral
Agent" and collectively as "Supplemental Collateral Agents").

          In the event that Agent appoints a Supplemental Collateral Agent with
respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty
expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be
exercised by or vested in or conveyed to Agent with respect to such Collateral
shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Collateral Agent to the
extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral
Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such
Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every
covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the
exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run
to and be enforceable by either Agent or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 9 and of subsections 10.2 and 10.3 that
refer to Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Agent
and all references therein to Agent shall be deemed to be references to Agent
and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require.

          Should any instrument in writing from Holdings, Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by
Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such
rights, powers, privileges and duties, Company shall, or shall cause Holdings or
Company's Subsidiaries to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such
instruments promptly upon request by Agent.  In case any Supplemental Collateral
Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or
be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental
Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised
by Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

     9.2  Powers and Duties; General Immunity.
          -----------------------------------

               A.  Powers; Duties Specified. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes
Agent take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers,
rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as are
specifically delegated or granted to Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are
expressly specified in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Agent may
exercise such powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through
its agents or employees. Agent shall not have, by reason of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any
Lender or Company; and nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to
impose

                                      146
<PAGE>

upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

               B.  No Responsibility for Certain Matters. Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or
statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or
in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or
any other documents furnished or made by Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of
Company to Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan Documents and the
transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial condition or business
affairs of Company or any other Person liable for the payment of any
Obligations, nor shall Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants
or agreements contained in any of the Loan Documents or as to the use of the
proceeds of the Loans or the use of the Letters of Credit or as to the existence
or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default.
Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Agent
shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of
outstanding Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts
thereof.

               C.  Exculpatory Provisions. Neither Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for any
action taken or omitted by Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan
Documents except to the extent caused by Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any
action (including the failure to take an action) in connection with this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from the exercise of any power,
discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until
Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite Lenders
(or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under
subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Requisite Lenders
(or such other Lenders, as the case may be), Agent shall be entitled to act or
(where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such power, discretion
or authority, in accordance with such instructions. Without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, (i) Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any communication, instrument or document
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected
in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for
Holdings, Company and its Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other
professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of
action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or (where so
instructed) refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such
other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection
10.6).

               D.  Agent Entitled to Act as Lender. The agency hereby created
shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any
duties or obligations upon, Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender
hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters of
Credit, Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and
functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any
similar term shall, unless

                                      147
<PAGE>

the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual
capacity. Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking,
investment banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with Company or
any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing the duties specified herein,
and may accept fees and other consideration from Company for services in
connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the
same to Lenders.

     9.3  Independent Investigation by Lenders; No Responsibility For Appraisal
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
of Creditworthiness.
-------------------

          Each Lender agrees that it has made its own independent investigation
of the financial condition and affairs of Holdings, Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the making of the Loans and the issuance of Letters of Credit
hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of
the creditworthiness of Holdings, Company and its Subsidiaries. Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to
make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto,
whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time
or times thereafter, and Agent shall not have any responsibility with respect to
the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to Lenders.

     9.4  Right to Indemnity.
          ------------------

          Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to
indemnify Agent and the officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys,
professional advisors and affiliates of Agent to the extent that any such Person
shall not have been reimbursed by Company, for and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses other than with respect to taxes (including counsel fees and
disbursements and fees and disbursements of any financial advisor engaged by
Agent) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against Agent or and other such Persons in
exercising the powers, rights and remedies of Agent or performing duties of
Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity
as Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
                --------
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct.  If any indemnity furnished to Agent or any other such
Person for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Agent, be insufficient or become
impaired, Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to
do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

     9.5  Successor Agent.
          ---------------

          Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice
thereof to Lenders and Company.  Upon any such notice of resignation, Requisite
Lenders shall have the right, upon five Business Days' notice to Company, to
appoint a successor Agent.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, that successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of

                                      148
<PAGE>

the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under
this Agreement.

     9.6  Collateral Documents and Guaranties.
          -----------------------------------

          Each Lender hereby further authorizes Agent, on behalf of and for the
benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Collateral Document as secured party and
to be the agent for and representative of Lenders under each Guaranty, and each
Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each Collateral Document and Guaranty;
provided that Agent shall not (i) enter into or consent to any material
--------
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision contained in any
Collateral Document or the Guaranty or (ii) release any Collateral (except as
otherwise expressly permitted or required pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or the applicable Collateral Document), in each case without the prior
consent of Requisite Lenders (or, if required pursuant to subsection 10.6, all
Lenders); provided further, however, that, without further written consent or
          -------- -------  -------
authorization from Lenders, Agent may execute any documents or instruments
necessary to (a) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the
subject of a sale or other disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement or

notwithstanding, Company, Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (X) no Lender
shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under
any Collateral Document or to enforce any Guaranty, it being understood and
agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents and
the Guaranties may be exercised solely by Agent for the benefit of Lenders in
accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of a foreclosure by
Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, Agent or
any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such
sale and Agent, as agent for and representative of Lenders (but not any Lender
or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless Requisite
Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of
bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any
portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of
the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral
payable by Agent at such sale.

          -------------------------------------------------------------------
Letters of Credit.
-----------------

          A. General. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of Lenders (it being
understood that Lenders' rights of assignment are subject to the further
provisions of this subsection 10.1). Neither Company's rights or obligations
hereunder nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by Company
without the prior written consent of all Lenders (and any attempted assignment
or transfer by Company without such consent shall be null and void). No sale,
assignment or transfer or participation of any Letter of Credit or any
participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment, transfer
or participation of a corresponding interest in the Revolving Loan Commitment
and the Revolving Loans of the Revolving Lender effecting such sale, assignment,
transfer or participation. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, the Affiliates of each of Agent and Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          B. Assignments.

               (i)  Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Any Lender may assign to
                    --------------------------------
     one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its rights and
     obligations

                                      150
<PAGE>

     under this Agreement; provided that (a), except (1) in the case of an
                           --------
     assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's rights
     and obligations under this Agreement or (2) in the case of an assignment to
     a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Affiliated Fund of a Lender, the
     aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Exposure or Term Loan Exposure, as
     the case may be, of the assigning Lender and the assignee subject to each
     such assignment shall not be less than $3,500,000 in the case of any
     assignment of a Revolving Loan and/or a Term Loan, unless Agent otherwise
     consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (b)
     each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate
     part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
     Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, (c) the
     parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment
     Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (unless
     the assignee is an Affiliate or an Affiliated Fund of the assignor, in
     which case no fee shall be required), and the Eligible Assignee, if it
     shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to Agent information reasonably
     requested by Agent, including such forms, certificates or other evidence,
     if any, with respect to United States federal income tax withholding
     matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be required to
     deliver to Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii), and (d) except in the
     case of an assignment to another Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
     Affiliated Fund of a Lender, Agent shall have consented thereto.  Upon such
     execution, delivery and consent, from and after the effective date
     specified in such Assignment Agreement, (y) the assignee thereunder shall
     be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
     have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have
     the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (z) the assigning
     Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
     hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement,
     relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination
     of this Agreement under subsection 10.9B) and be released from its
     obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment
     Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's
     rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be
     a party hereto; provided that, anything contained in any of the Loan
                     --------
     Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing
     Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender shall
     continue to have all rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with
     respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of
     such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
     thereunder). The assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such
     assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its Notes to
     Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall be issued to the
     assignee and/or to the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of
     Exhibit IV or Exhibit V annexed hereto, as the case may be, with
     ----------    ---------
     appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments and/or outstanding
     Revolving Loans and/or outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be, of the
     assignee and/or the assigning Lender. Other than as provided in subsection
     10.5, any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under
     this Agreement that does not

                                      151
<PAGE>

     comply with this subsection 10.1B shall be treated for purposes of this
     Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
     obligations in accordance with subsection 10.1C.

          (ii)     Acceptance by Agent; Recordation in Register. Upon its
                   --------------------------------------------
     receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an
     assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with the
     processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection 10.1B(i) and any
     forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal
     income tax withholding matters that such assignee may be required to
     deliver to Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii), Agent shall, if Agent
     has consented to the assignment evidenced thereby (to the extent such
     consent is required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such
     Assignment Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein
     (which acceptance shall evidence any required consent of Agent to such
     assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in the Register,
     and (c) give prompt notice thereof to Company. Agent shall maintain a copy
     of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as provided in
     this subsection 10.1B(ii).

     C.  Participations.  Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to,
Company or Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this
Agreement; provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
           --------
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) Company,
Agent and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
(iv) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Exposure and Term Loan Exposure
with respect to which such participation relates shall not be less than
$2,500,000, unless Agent otherwise consents. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
                                                                      --------
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
directly affecting (i) the extension of the scheduled final maturity date of any
Loan allocated to such participation or (ii) a reduction of the principal amount
of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan allocated to such participation.
Subject to the further provisions of this subsection 10.1C, Company agrees that
each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.6D and 2.7
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to subsection 10.1B. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 10.4 as though
it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to subsection
                  --------
10.5 as though it were a Lender. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive
any greater payment under subsections 2.6D and 2.7 than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with Company's prior informed written consent. A Participant that would be
a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
subsection 2.7 unless Company is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of Company, to comply
and actually complies with subsections 2.7B(iii), 2.8A and

                                      152
<PAGE>

2.8B as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant shall in no
                                 --------
event be entitled to greater benefits under subsection 2.7 than it would be
entitled to if it were a Lender hereunder.

          D.  Pledges and Assignments.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its Loans, and the other
Obligations owed to such Lender, to secure obligations of such Lender, including
without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any Federal
Reserve Bank; provided that (i) no Lender shall be relieved of any of its
              --------
obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment or pledge and (ii) in
no event shall any assignee or pledgee be considered to be a "Lender" or be
entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action
hereunder.

          E.  Information.  Each Lender may furnish any information concerning
Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender from time to time
to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants), subject to subsection 10.19.

          F.  Agreements of Lenders.  Each Lender listed on the signature pages
hereof hereby agrees (i) that it is an Eligible Assignee described in clause (A)
of the definition thereof; (ii) that it has experience and expertise in the
making of loans such as the Loans; and (iii) that it will make its Loans for its
own account in the ordinary course of its business and without a view to
distribution of such Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject
to the provisions of this subsection 10.1, the disposition of such Loans or any
interests therein shall at all times remain within its exclusive control). Each
Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be
deemed to agree that the agreements of such Lender contained in Section 2(c) of
such Assignment Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference.

     10.2 Expenses.
          --------

          Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

hereinafter defined); provided that Company shall not have any obligation to any
                      --------
Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent
such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence or willful

     10.4 Set-Off; Security Interest in Deposit Accounts.
          ----------------------------------------------

          In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable
law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default and consultation with Agent each Lender is hereby authorized by
Company at any time or from time to time, without notice to Company or to any
other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including
Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by that Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of Company and each other Loan Party against and on account of the
obligations and liabilities of Company or any other Loan Party to that Lender
(or any Affiliate of such Lender) or to any other Lender (or any Affiliate of
any other Lender) under this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations
therein and the other Loan Documents, including all claims of any nature or
description arising out of or connected with this Agreement, the Letters of
Credit and participations therein or any other Loan Document, irrespective of
whether or not (i) that Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (ii) the
principal of or the interest on the Loans or any amounts in respect of the
Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and
payable pursuant to Section 8 and although said obligations and liabilities, or
any of them, may be contingent or unmatured. Company hereby further grants to
Agent and each Lender a security interest in all deposits and accounts
maintained with Agent or such Lender as security for the Obligations.

     10.5 Ratable Sharing.
          ---------------

          Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall,
whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made
and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon
security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan
Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash

                                      155
<PAGE>

collateral under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other Insolvency Laws, receive
payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal,
interest, amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other
amounts then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate Amounts Due" to such Lender) that is
greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the
Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify Agent and each other Lender of
the receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase
assignments (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of an
assignment simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such
payment) of the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such
recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion
to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided that if all or part of such
                                      --------
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or
otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for
such assignments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest.  Company expressly consents to
the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any purchaser of an assignment so
purchased may exercise any and all rights of a Lender as to such assignment as
fully as if that Lender had complied with the provisions of subsection 10.1B
with respect to such assignment.  In order to further evidence such assignment
(and without prejudice to the effectiveness of the assignment provisions set
forth above), each purchasing Lender and each selling Lender agree to enter into
an Assignment Agreement at the request of a selling Lender or a purchasing
Lender, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
each such Lender.

          ----------------------

          No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or of the Notes, and no consent to any departure by Company
therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of
Requisite Lenders; provided that no such amendment, modification, termination,

(iv) no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of
Section 9 or of any other provision of this Agreement which, by its terms,
expressly requires the approval or concurrence of Agent shall be effective
without the written concurrence of Agent. Agent may, but shall have no
obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments,
modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender. Any waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on Company in any case
shall entitle Company to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this subsection 10.6 shall be binding upon each
Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by Company, on
Company.

     10.7 Independence of Covenants.
          -------------------------

          All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a
particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the
fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within
the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event
of Default or Potential Event of Default if such action is taken or condition
exists.

     10.8 Notices; Effectiveness of Signatures.
          ------------------------------------

          Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or other
communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing and
may be personally served, or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or
courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person
or by courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile in complete and legible
form, or three Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail with
postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided that notices to Agent shall not
                                        --------
be effective until received.  For the purposes hereof, the address of each party
hereto shall be as set forth under such party's name on the signature pages
hereof or (i) as to Company and Agent, such other address as shall be designated
by such Person in a written notice delivered to the other parties

                                      157
<PAGE>

hereto and (ii) as to each other party, such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice delivered to Agent. Electronic mail
may be used to distribute routine communications, such as financial statements
and other information; provided, however, that no signature with respect to any
                       --------  -------
notice, request, agreement, waiver, amendment or other document or any notice
that is intended to have binding effect may be sent by electronic mail.

           Loan Documents and notices under the Loan Documents may be
transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of any such documents
and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force and effect
as an original copy with manual signatures and shall be binding on all Loan
Parties, Agent and Lenders.  Agent may also require that any such documents and
signature be confirmed by a manually-signed copy thereof; provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
that the failure to request or deliver any such manually-signed copy shall not
affect the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

     10.9  Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.
           ------------------------------------------------------

           A.  All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans
and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.

           B.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to
the contrary, the agreements of Company set forth in subsections 2.6D, 2.7,
3.5A, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.17 and 10.18 and the agreements of Lenders set forth
in subsections 9.2C, 9.4, 10.5 and 10.18 shall survive the payment of the Loans,
the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of
any amounts drawn thereunder, and the termination of this Agreement.

     10.10 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
           -----------------------------------------------------

           No failure or delay on the part of an Agent or any Lender in the
exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a
waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege.  All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

     10.11 Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.
           -------------------------------

           Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal
any assets in favor of Company or any other party or against or in payment of
any or all of the Obligations.  To the extent that Company makes a payment or
payments to Agent or Lenders (or to Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or Agent
or Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff,
and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or
any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common
law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation
or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights

                                      158
<PAGE>

and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

     10.12 Severability.
           ------------

           In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or the
Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

     10.13 Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders' Rights.
           ----------------------------------------------------------

           The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall
be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders, or
Lenders and Company, as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender
shall be a separate and independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be
necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

     10.14  Headings.
            --------

           Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included herein
for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

     10.15 Applicable Law.
           --------------

           THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION

     PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND
     BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT;

           (V)   AGREES THAT LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
     OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST COMPANY IN

rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each party hereto further
warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel
and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following
consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY
NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN
WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION 10.18 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS

and sound banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Company that in
any event a Lender may make disclosures (a) to its and its Affiliates'

is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and
instructed to keep such information confidential), (b) to the extent requested

           --------
court order, each Lender shall notify Company of any request by any Government
Authority or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection
with any examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such
Government Authority) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to
disclosure of such information; and provided, further that in no event shall any
                                    --------  -------
Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

     10.20  Counterparts; Effectiveness.
            ---------------------------

            This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements
hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts
and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may
be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single
counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same
document.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a
counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto.

     10.21  Judgment.
            --------

            A.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under any Loan Document in any
currency (the "Original Currency") into another currency (the "Other Currency")
the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate or exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal
banking procedures, Agent could purchase the Original Currency with the Other
Currency at London, England or Toronto, Canada, as applicable, on the second
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

            B. The obligation of a Loan Party in respect of any sum due in the
Original Currency from it to any Lender or Agent hereunder shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the
extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or Agent (as
the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency such
Lender or Agent (as the case may be) may, in accordance with normal banking
procedures, purchase Original Currency with such Other Currency; if the amount
of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to
such Lender or Agent (as the case may be) in the Original Currency, such Loan
Party agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to
indemnify such Lender or Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if
the amount of the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due
to any Lender or Agent (as the case may be) in the Original Currency, such
Lender or Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to such Loan Party such
excess.
