         2.2.3 Eurodollar Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs.
               ------------------------------------------------------------
(a) (i)  In the event that Lender shall have determined (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon Maker absent manifest error) that by reason
of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then Lender shall
forthwith give notice by telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing,
to Maker at least one (1) Business Day prior to the last day of the related
Interest Period. If such notice is given, the Loan shall bear interest at the
Adjusted Prime Rate beginning on the first day of the next succeeding Interest
Period.

         (ii) If, pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.2.3(a), the Loan is
bearing interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate and Lender shall determine (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Maker absent manifest error)
that the event(s) or circumstance(s) which resulted in such conversion shall no
longer be applicable, Lender shall give notice thereof to Maker by telephone of
such determination, confirmed in writing, to Maker as soon as reasonably
practical, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the last day
of the then current Interest Period. If such notice is given, the Loan shall
bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate beginning on the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall Maker have the right to elect to have the Loan
bear interest at either the Eurodollar Rate or the Adjusted Prime Rate.

         (b)  If any requirement of law or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall hereafter make it unlawful for
Lender in good faith to make or maintain the Loan bearing interest at the
Eurodollar Rate, (I) the obligation of Lender hereunder to make the Loan bearing
interest at the Eurodollar Rate shall be canceled forthwith and (II) the Loan
shall automatically bear interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate on the next
succeeding Payment Date or within such earlier period as required by law. Maker
hereby agrees promptly to pay Lender (within fifteen (15) days of Lender's
written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to compensate Lender
for any reasonable costs incurred by Lender in making any conversion in
accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, any interest or
fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or
maintain the Loan hereunder. Upon written demand from Maker, Lender shall
demonstrate in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to Lender's
determination and the calculation substantiating the Adjusted Prime Rate and any
additional costs incurred by Lender in making the conversion. Lender's written
notice of such costs, as certified to Maker, shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

         (c)  In the event that any change in any requirement of law or in the
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance in good faith by Lender
with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) hereafter
issued from any central bank or other Governmental Authority:

              (I)   shall hereafter impose, modify or hold applicable any
                    reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
                    requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
                    liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by,
                    or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
                    funds by, any office of Lender which is not otherwise
                    included in the determination of LIBOR hereunder;

              (II)  shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the
                    Eurodollar Rate, hereafter have the effect of reducing the
                    rate of return on Lender's capital as a consequence of its
                    obligations hereunder to a level below that which Lender
                    could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
                    compliance (taking into consideration Lender's policies with
                    respect to capital adequacy) by any amount deemed by Lender
                    to be material; or

              (III) shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the
                    Eurodollar Rate, hereafter impose on Lender any other
                    condition, the result of which is to increase the cost to
                    Lender of making, renewing or maintaining loans or
                    extensions of credit or to reduce any amount receivable
                    hereunder;

then, in any such case, Maker shall promptly pay Lender (within fifteen (15)
days of Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which
Lender deems to be material as reasonably determined by Lender. If Lender
becomes entitled to claim



                                      -20-
<PAGE>

any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.2.3(c), Lender shall provide
Maker with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice specifying in
reasonable detail the event or circumstance by reason of which it has become so
entitled and the additional amount required to fully compensate Lender for such
additional cost or reduced amount. A certificate as to any additional costs or
amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lender to Maker
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This provision shall
survive payment of the Note and the satisfaction of all other obligations of
Maker under the Note, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     (d)  Maker agrees to indemnify Lender and to hold Lender harmless from any
loss or expense which Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of (I) any
default after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods by Maker
in payment of the principal of or interest on the Loan while bearing interest at
the Eurodollar Rate, including, without limitation, any such loss or expense
arising from interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by
it in order to maintain the Eurodollar Rate, (II) any prepayment (whether
voluntary or mandatory) of the Loan on a day that (A) is not the Payment Date
immediately following the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or
(B) is the Payment Date immediately following the last day of an Interest Period
with respect thereto if Maker did not give the prior written notice of such
prepayment required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by Lender
to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the Eurodollar Rate
hereunder and (III) the conversion (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary
or involuntary) of the Applicable Interest Rate from the Eurodollar Rate to the
Adjusted Prime Rate with respect to any portion of the outstanding principal
amount of the Loan then bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate on a date other
than the Payment Date immediately following the last day of an Interest Period,
including, without limitation, such loss or expenses arising from interest or
fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain
the Eurodollar Rate hereunder (the amounts referred to in clauses (I), (II) and
(III) are herein referred to collectively as the "Breakage Costs"). This
provision shall survive payment of the Loan in full and the satisfaction of all
other obligations of Maker under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     2.2.4     Payment on Maturity Date. Maker shall pay to Lender on the
               ------------------------
Maturity Date the outstanding principal balance, all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Note, the Security
Instruments and the other Loan Documents.

     2.2.5     Payments after Default. Except as provided in Section 3.18
               ----------------------
hereof, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
shall accrue at the Default Rate, calculated from the date such payment was due
without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein, such amount to be
applied by Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall
determine in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating
applications thereof between interest and principal. Interest at the Default
Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the
actual receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then
due). To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at the Default Rate
shall be added to the Debt, shall itself accrue interest at the same rate as the
Loan and shall be secured by the Security Instruments. This paragraph shall not
be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date of the payment of
the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy accruing to Lender by
reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights
under the Note to accelerate and continue to demand payment of the Debt upon the
happening of any Event of Default.

     2.2.6     Late Payment Charge. Except as provided in Section 3.18 hereof,
               -------------------
if any Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount is not paid by Maker on the date on
which it is due, Maker shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the
lesser of five percent (5%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted
by applicable law in order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling
and processing such delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of
the use of such delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the
Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

     2.2.7     Usury Savings. This Agreement and the Note are subject to the
               -------------
express condition that at no time shall Maker be obligated or required to pay
interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject
Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of
the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the terms of this

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Maker is at any time required or
obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at a rate in
excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Applicable Interest Rate or the Default
Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to the
Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate
shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on
account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to
Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

     2.2.8     Taxes. If the Loan is bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate,
               -----
all payments made by Maker hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and
without reduction for or on account of, Foreign Taxes, excluding, in the case of
Lender, taxes measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by
the jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of Lender, taxes measured by its overall
net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of Lender's
applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof. If any non-
excluded Foreign Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to
Lender hereunder (and such Foreign Taxes are not a result of activities of
Lender unrelated to the Loan or Maker), the amounts so payable to Lender shall
be increased to the extent necessary to yield to Lender (after payment of all
non-excluded Foreign Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder
at the rate or in the amounts specified hereunder. Whenever any non-excluded
Foreign Tax is payable pursuant to applicable law by Maker, Maker shall send to
Lender an original official receipt, if available, or certified copy thereof
showing payment of such non-excluded Foreign Tax. Maker hereby indemnifies
Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable
by Lender which may result from any failure by Maker to pay any such non-
excluded Foreign Tax when due to the appropriate taxing authority of which
Lender has used its commercially reasonable efforts to provide Maker with prior
written notice of or any failure by Maker to remit to Lender the required
receipts or other required documentary evidence, provided, however, in the event
that Lender or any successor and/or assign of Lender is not incorporated under
the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof Lender agrees that,
prior to the first date on which any payment is due such entity hereunder, it
will deliver to Maker (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case
may be, certifying in each case that such entity is entitled to receive payments
under the Note, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or successor
applicable form, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United
States backup withholding tax. Each entity required to deliver to Maker a Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI or Form W-9 pursuant to the preceding sentence further
undertakes to deliver to Maker two further copies of the said letter and W-8BEN
or W-8ECI or Form W-9, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such letter or
form expires (which, in the case of the Form W-8ECI, is the last day of each
U.S. taxable year of the non-U.S. entity) or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent letter and form
previously delivered by it to Maker, and such other extensions or renewals
thereof as may reasonably be requested by Maker, certifying in the case of a
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI that such entity is entitled to receive payments under the
Note without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes,
unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable
or which would prevent such entity from duly completing and delivering any such
letter or form with respect to it and such entity advises Maker that it is not
capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax, and in the case of a Form W-9, establishing an
exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such entity fails to provide a duly completed Form W-8BEN or W-
8ECI or other applicable form and, under applicable law, in order to avoid
liability for Foreign Taxes, Maker is required to withhold on payments made to
such entity that has failed to provide the applicable form, Maker shall be
entitled to withhold the appropriate amount of Foreign Taxes. In such event,
Maker shall promptly provide to such entity evidence of payment of such Foreign
Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and shall promptly forward to such
entity any official tax receipts or other documentation with respect to the
payment of the Foreign Taxes as may be issued by the taxing authority.

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

     2.2.9     Extension. Maker shall have the right to extend the Maturity Date
               ---------
for three (3) additional periods of twelve (12) months each (each, an "Extension
Term") by giving not less than thirty (30) days and not more than ninety (90)
days written notice (the "Extension Notice") prior to the Maturity Date (as such
Maturity Date may be extended by the first or second Extension Term, as
applicable) to Lender, provided that, with respect to each Extension Term, (i)
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) prior to the
commencement of each Extension Term, Maker shall pay to Lender the applicable
Extension Fee.

     Section 2.3         Prepayments.
                         -----------

     2.3.1     Voluntary Prepayments. On any Payment Date, Maker may, at its
               ---------------------
option, prepay the Loan in whole or in part, upon satisfaction of the following
conditions:

                  (a) Maker shall provide prior written notice to Lender
specifying the date (the "Prepayment Date") upon which the prepayment is to be
made, which notice shall be delivered to Lender not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to such payment.

                  (b) Maker shall pay to Lender, simultaneously with such
prepayment, (i) if the Prepayment Date is not a Payment Date, (A) all interest
on the principal balance of the Note then being prepaid which would have accrued
through the end of the Interest Period then in effect (the "Interest Shortfall")
and (B) all Breakage Costs, if any, and without duplication of sums paid
pursuant to clause (i) with respect to such prepayment, and (ii) the applicable
Prepayment Fee.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Prepayment Fee shall
be due in connection with a prepayment in connection with the release of the
Peachtree Property provided (1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (2) such prepayment is in connection with a Peachtree Sale, (3)
Maker pays to Lender, simultaneously with such prepayment, the Interest
Shortfall, if any, and any other sums then due under the Note, this Agreement,

Individual Property release, including, without limitation, the terms and
conditions of Section 2.5 herein and (ii) no Prepayment Fee shall be due in
connection with a prepayment by Maker after the occurrence of a Casualty or
Condemnation to any Individual Property provided (1) no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, (2) the Net Proceeds in connection with such
Casualty or Condemnation have been applied by Lender to pay down the outstanding
principal balance of the Note and (3) Maker pays to Lender simultaneously with
such prepayment, the Interest Shortfall, if any, and any other sums then due

Documents.

                  (d) In addition to the foregoing provisions, Maker shall have
the right to obtain a release of the applicable Individual Property in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.5 hereof, but Maker shall not be
obligated to pay a Prepayment Fee in connection therewith in the event that (i)
Lender has elected to apply the Net Proceeds of a Casualty or Condemnation of
the applicable Individual Property towards the reduction of the then outstanding
principal balance of the Note and (ii) no Event of Default has occurred and
shall be continuing under this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instruments or
any of the other Loan Documents.

     2.3.2     Mandatory Prepayments. On the next occurring Payment Date
               ---------------------
following the date on which Maker actually receives any Net Proceeds, if and to
the extent Lender is not obligated to make such Net Proceeds available to Maker
for the restoration of the Property, Maker shall prepay the outstanding
principal balance of the Note in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%)
of such Net Proceeds. Any partial prepayment under this Section shall be applied
to the last payments of principal due under the Loan but, no Prepayment Fee
shall be due in connection therewith.

     2.3.3     Prepayments After Default. If, following an Event of Default,
               -------------------------
Lender shall accelerate the Debt and Maker thereafter tenders payment of all or
any part of the Debt, or if all or any portion of the Debt is recovered by
Lender after such Event of Default, such payment may be made only on the next
occurring Payment Date together with

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

the payment of interest due and payable on such date together with the
Prepayment Fee and all other sums due and payable under the Note, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

     2.3.4     Making of Payments. Each payment by Maker hereunder or under the
               ------------------
Note shall be made in funds settled through the New York Clearing House
Interbank Payments System or other funds immediately available to Lender by 2:00
p.m., New York City time, on or prior to the date such payment is due, to Lender
by deposit to such account as Lender may designate by written notice to Maker.
Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Note shall be stated to be due on a
day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the first
Business Day succeeding such scheduled due date. All payments made by Maker
hereunder or under the Note or the other Loan Documents shall be made
irrespective of, and without any deduction for, any setoff, defense or
counterclaims.

     Section 2.4         Interest Rate Cap Agreement. (a) Within five (5)
                         ---------------------------
Business Days after notice from Lender that an Interest Rate Cap Event has
occurred, Maker shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, and shall thereafter
maintain in effect, an Interest Rate Cap Agreement, which shall be coterminous
with the Loan (as the same may be extended) and have a notional amount which
shall not at any time be less than the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
and which shall at all times have a strike rate equal to the Strike Rate. The
Counterparty shall be obligated under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement to make
monthly payments equal to the excess of 1 month LIBOR over the Strike Rate,
calculated on the notional amount. The notional amount of the Interest Rate Cap
Agreement may be reduced from time to time in amounts equal to any prepayment of
the principal of the Loan in accordance with Sections 2.3 and 2.5 hereof.

                  (b) Maker shall collaterally assign to Lender pursuant to an
Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement substantially in the form annexed
hereto as Exhibit E, all of its right, title and interest to receive any and all
payments under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (and any related guarantee, if
any) and shall deliver to Lender an executed counterpart of such Interest Rate
Cap Agreement and notify the Counterparty of such collateral assignment (either
in such Interest Rate Cap Agreement or by separate instrument). The Counterparty
shall agree in writing to make all payments it is required to make under the
Interest Rate Cap Agreement directly to Lender or such other entity or account
as directed by Lender. At such time as the Loan is repaid in full, all of
Lender's right, title and interest in the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall
terminate and Lender shall promptly execute and deliver at Maker's sole cost and
expense, such documents as may be required to evidence Lender's release of the
Interest Rate Cap Agreement and to notify the Counterparty of such release.

                  (c) Maker shall comply with all of its obligations under the
terms and provisions of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement. All amounts paid by the
Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be deposited
immediately into the Lockbox Account or if the Lockbox Account is not then
required to be in effect, into such account as specified by Lender in writing.
Maker shall take all actions reasonably requested by Lender to enforce Lender's
rights under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement in the event of a default by the
Counterparty and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify any of its rights
thereunder.

                  (d) In the event of any downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of the long-term unsecured debt credit rating of the Counterparty below "AA" (or
its equivalent) by the Rating Agencies, Maker shall replace the Interest Rate
Cap Agreement with a Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement not later than ten
(10) Business Days following receipt of notice from Lender or Servicer of such
downgrade, withdrawal or qualification.

                  (e) In the event that Maker fails to purchase and deliver to
Lender the Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any replacement Interest Cap Agreement
as and when required hereunder, Lender may purchase such Interest Rate Cap
Agreement and the cost incurred by Lender in purchasing such Interest Rate Cap
Agreement shall be paid by Maker to Lender with interest thereon at the Default
Rate from the date such cost was incurred by Lender until such cost is paid by
Maker to Lender.

     2.5.1     Release of Individual Property. Subject to the provisions of
               ------------------------------
Section 2.3.1(c) hereof relating to the release of the Peachtree Property,
provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower may
obtain the release of an Individual Property from the Lien of the Security
Instrument thereon (and related Loan Documents) and the release of Borrower's
obligations under the Loan Documents with respect to such Individual Property
(other than those expressly stated to survive), provided that such Borrower does
not own any of the other Properties then encumbered by the Lien of the Security
Instruments, but only upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

     (a)        Borrower shall provide Lender with at least fifteen (15) days
but no more than ninety (90) days prior written notice of its request to obtain
a release of the Individual Property;

     (b)        Borrower shall make a payment to Lender by a wire transfer of
immediately available federal funds in an amount equal to the Release Price for
the applicable Individual Property, together with (i) all accrued and unpaid
interest on the amount of principal being prepaid, (ii) the Prepayment Fee, if
required pursuant to the terms hereof (provided, however, (y) in connection with
a release only, the Prepayment Fee shall only be calculated on the Allocated
Loan Amount of the Individual Property being released (and not on the Release
Price) and (z) the Net Proceeds of a Casualty or Condemnation applied to the
reduction of the principal balance of the Debt shall be credited against and
reduce the Release Price of the Individual Property that was the subject of said
Casualty or Condemnation), (iii) if such payment is not made on a Payment Date,
the Interest Shortfall with respect to the amount prepaid, (iv) Breakage Costs,
if any, but without duplication of any payment made pursuant to Subsection (iii)
hereof; and (v) all other sums due under this Agreement, the Note or the other
Loan Documents in connection with a partial prepayment;

     (c)        Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the date of such release, a release of Lien (and related Loan
Documents) for such Individual Property for execution by Lender. Such release
shall be in a form appropriate in each State in which the Individual Property is
located and that contains standard provisions, if any, protecting the rights of
the releasing lender. In addition, Borrower shall provide all other
documentation Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in
connection with such release, together with an Officer's Certificate certifying
that such documentation (i) is in compliance with all Legal Requirements, (ii)
will effect such release in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
(iii) will not impair or otherwise adversely affect the Liens, security
interests and other rights of Lender under the Loan Documents not being released
(or as to the parties to the Loan Documents and Properties subject to the Loan
Documents not being released);

     (d)        After giving effect to such release, the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio for the Properties then remaining subject to the Liens of the Security
Instruments shall be equal to the greater of (i) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the Closing Date,
and (ii) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all of the then remaining
Properties (including the Individual Property to be released) for the twelve
(12) full calendar months immediately preceding the release of the Individual
Property;

     (e)        If the applicable Borrower continues to own an Individual
Property subject to the Lien of a Security Instrument, the Individual Property
to be released shall be conveyed to a Person other than a Borrower or Principal;
and

     (f)        Payment of all Lender's reasonable costs and expenses, including
due diligence review costs and reasonable counsel fees and disbursements
incurred in connection with the release of the Individual Property from the Lien
of the related Security Instrument and the review and approval of the documents
and information required to be delivered in connection therewith.

     2.5.2     Release on Payment in Full. Lender shall, at the expense of
               --------------------------
Borrower, upon payment in full of all principal and interest due on the Loan and
all other amounts due and payable under the Loan Documents in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Note and this Agreement, release the Lien of the
Security Instrument on each Individual Property not theretofore released.

     Section 2.6    Substitution of Properties. Subject to the terms and
                    --------------------------
conditions set forth in this Section 2.6, after the expiration of the Lockout
Period, Borrower may obtain a release of the Lien of a Security Instrument (and
the related Loan Documents) encumbering an Individual Property (a "Release
Property") by substituting therefor another hotel property of like kind and
quality acquired by Borrower or an Affiliate of Borrower (provided, however, if
the Substitute Property shall be owned by an Affiliate of Borrower said
Affiliate (i) shall assume all the obligation of Borrower under this Agreement,
the Note and the other Loan Documents and (ii) shall become a party to the Note
and the other Loan Documents and shall be bound by the terms and provisions
thereof as if it had executed the Note and the other Loan Documents and shall
have the rights and obligations of Borrower thereunder) (individually, a
"Substitute Property" and collectively, the "Substitute Properties"), provided
that the following conditions precedent are satisfied:

     (a)  Lender shall have received at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice requesting the substitution and identifying the Substitute Property and
Release Property.

     (b)  If the applicable Borrower continues to own an Individual Property
subject to the Lien of a Security Instrument, Lender shall have received a copy
of a deed conveying all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the
Release Property to a Person other than Borrower or Principal pursuant to an
arms length transaction and a letter from Borrower countersigned by a title
insurance company acknowledging receipt of such deed and agreeing to record such
deed in the real estate records for the county in which the Release Property is
located or in the case of the San Juan Property, to submit such deed for
recording in the Registry of Property for Carolina, Puerto Rico.

     (c)  Lender shall have received a current Appraisal, of the Substitute
Property prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the release and
substitution (i) showing an appraised value equal to or greater than the
appraised value of the Release Property as of the date hereof; and (ii) which
supports an aggregate loan-to-value ratio with respect to the Properties
remaining subject to the lien of the Security Instruments after the substitution
not greater than the ratio equal to the lesser of (A) the aggregate loan-to-
value ratio as of the Closing Date with respect to all of the Properties and (B)
the aggregate loan-to-value ratio with respect to the Properties remaining
subject to the lien of the Security Instruments immediately prior to the date of
the proposed substitution.

     (d)  Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower certifying,
together with other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage lender that, after the substitution of a Substitute
Property and the release of the Release Property, (i) the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the date of
the substitution with respect to all Properties remaining subject to the lien of
the Security Instruments after the substitution shall be equal to or greater
than (A) Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (B) Debt Service Coverage Ratio for
the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the substitution
(including the Release Property and excluding the Substitute Property) and (ii)
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) months immediately preceding
the substitution with respect to the Substitute Property is equal or greater
than the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months
immediately preceding the Closing Date with respect to the Release Property.

     (e)  If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have received
confirmation in writing from the Rating Agencies to the effect that such
substitution will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of the
respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such substitution for the
Securities issued in connection with the Securitization that are then
outstanding. If the Loan is not part of a Securitization, Lender shall have
consented in writing to such substitution, which consent shall be given in
Lender's reasonable discretion applying the requirements of a prudent mortgage
loan lender with respect to real estate collateral of similar size, scope and
value of the Substitute Property.

     (f)  No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and Borrower
shall be in compliance in all material respects with all terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in each other Loan Document on Borrower's part
to be observed or performed. Lender shall have received a certificate from
Borrower confirming the foregoing, stating that the representations and
warranties of Borrower contained in this Agreement and the other Loan

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of
the substitution with respect to Borrower, the Properties and the Substitute
Property and containing any other representations and warranties with respect to
Borrower, the Properties, the Substitute Property or the Loan as (i) Lender, if
a Securitization has not occurred, or (ii) the Rating Agencies, if a
Securitization has occurred, may require, unless such certificate would be
inaccurate, such certificate to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Lender or the Rating Agencies, as applicable.

     (g)  Borrower shall (A) have executed, acknowledged and delivered to Lender
(I) a Security Instrument, an Assignment of Leases and Rents and two UCC-1
Financing Statements with respect to the Substitute Property, together with a
letter from Borrower countersigned by a title insurance company acknowledging
receipt of such Security Instrument, Assignment of Leases and Rents and UCC-1
Financing Statements and agreeing to record or file, as applicable, such
Security Instrument, Assignment of Leases and Rents and one of the UCC-1
Financing Statements in the real estate records for the county in which the
Substitute Property is located and to file one of the UCC-1 Financing Statements
in the office of the Secretary of State (or other central filing office) of the
State in which the Substitute Property is located, so as to effectively create
upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable first priority Liens upon
the Substitute Property, in favor of Lender (or such other trustee as may be
desired under local law), subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances and such
other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents and (II) an
Environmental Indemnity with respect to the Substitute Property and (B) have
caused the Guarantor to acknowledge and confirm its obligations under the Loan
Documents. The Security Instrument, Assignment of Leases and Rents, UCC-1
Financing Statements and Environmental Indemnity shall be the same in form and
substance as the counterparts of such documents executed and delivered with
respect to the related Release Property subject to modifications reflecting only
the Substitute Property as the Individual Property and such modifications
reflecting the laws of the State in which the Substitute Property is located.
The Security Instrument encumbering the Substitute Property shall secure all
amounts then outstanding under the Note, provided that in the event that the
jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located imposes a mortgage
recording, intangibles or similar tax and does not permit the allocation of
indebtedness for the purpose of determining the amount of such tax payable, the
principal amount secured by such Security Instrument shall be equal to one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Allocated Loan Amount for the
Substitute Property. The amount of the Loan allocated to the Substitute Property
(such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Substitute Allocated Loan
Amount") shall equal the Allocated Loan Amount of the related Release Property.

     (h)  Lender shall have received (A) to the extent available, any "tie-in"
or similar endorsement to each title insurance policy insuring the Lien of the
existing Security Instruments as of the date of the substitution with respect to
the title insurance policy insuring the Lien of the Security Instrument with
respect to the Substitute Property and (B) a title insurance policy (or a
marked, signed and redated commitment to issue such title insurance policy)
insuring the Lien of the Security Instrument encumbering the Substitute
Property, issued by the title company that issued the title insurance policies
insuring the Lien of the existing Security Instruments and dated as of the date
of the substitution, with reinsurance and direct access agreements that replace
such agreements issued in connection with the title insurance policy insuring
the Lien of the Security Instrument encumbering the Release Property. The title
insurance policy issued with respect to the Substitute Property shall (1)
provide coverage in the amount of the Substitute Allocated Loan Amount if the
"tie-in" or similar endorsement described above is available or, if such
endorsement is not available, in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the Substitute Allocated Loan Amount, (2) insure Lender that
the relevant Security Instrument creates a valid first lien on the Substitute
Property encumbered thereby, free and clear of all exceptions from coverage
other than Permitted Encumbrances and standard exceptions and exclusions from
coverage (as modified by the terms of any endorsements), (3) contain such
endorsements and affirmative coverages as are then available and are contained
in the title insurance policies insuring the Liens of the existing Security
Instruments, and (4) name Lender as the insured. Lender also shall have received
copies of paid receipts or other evidence showing that all premiums in respect
of such endorsements and title insurance policies have been paid.

     (i)  Lender shall have received a current Survey for each Substitute
Property, certified to the title company and Lender and their successors and
assigns, in the same form and having the same content as the certification of
the Survey of the Release Property prepared by a professional land surveyor
licensed in the State in

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

which the Substitute Property is located and acceptable to the Rating Agencies
in accordance with the 1999 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM
Land Title Surveys. Such Survey shall reflect the same legal description
contained in the title insurance policy relating to such Substitute Property and
shall include, among other things, a metes and bounds description of the real
property comprising part of such Substitute Property (unless such real property
has been satisfactorily designated by lot number on a recorded plat). The
surveyor's seal shall be affixed to each Survey and each Survey shall certify
whether or not the surveyed property is located in a "one-hundred-year flood
hazard area."

     (j)  Lender shall have received valid certificates of insurance indicating
that the requirements for the policies of insurance required for an Individual
Property hereunder have been satisfied with respect to the Substitute Property
and evidence of the payment of all premiums payable for the existing policy
period.

     (k)  Lender shall have received a Phase I environmental report dated not
more than 180 days prior to the proposed date of substitution and otherwise
acceptable to a prudent institutional mortgage lender and, if recommended under
the Phase I environmental report, a Phase II environmental report that would be
acceptable to a prudent institutional mortgage lender, which conclude that the
Substitute Property does not contain any unacceptable levels of Hazardous
Materials and is not subject to any significant risk of contamination from any
off-site Hazardous Materials.

     (l)  Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender (A) updates
certified by Borrower of all organizational documentation related to Borrower
and/or the formation, structure, existence, good standing and/or qualification
to do business delivered to Lender on the Closing Date; (B) good standing
certificates, certificates of qualification to do business in the jurisdiction
in which the Substitute Property is located (if required in such jurisdiction);
and (C) resolutions of Borrower authorizing the substitution and any actions
taken in connection with such substitution.

     (m)  Lender shall have received the following opinions of Borrower's
counsel: (A) an opinion or opinions of counsel admitted to practice under the
laws of the State in which the Substitute Property is located stating that the
Loan Documents delivered with respect to the Substitute Property pursuant to
clause (i) above are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject to the laws applicable to creditors' rights and equitable principles,
and that Borrower is qualified to do business and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction where the Substitute Property is located or that
Borrower is not required by applicable law to qualify to do business in such
jurisdiction; (B) an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Rating
Agencies if the Loan is part of a Securitization, or the Lender if the Loan is
not part of a Securitization, stating that the Loan Documents delivered with
respect to the Substitute Property pursuant to clause (i) above were, among
other things, duly authorized, executed and delivered by Borrower and that the
execution and delivery of such Loan Documents and the performance by Borrower of
its obligations thereunder will not cause a breach of, or a default under, any
agreement, document or instrument to which Borrower is a party or to which it or
its properties are bound; (C) an update of the Insolvency Opinion indicating
that the substitution does not affect the opinions set forth therein; (D) if the
Loan is part of a Securitization, an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Rating Agencies that the substitution does not constitute a "significant
modification" of the Loan under Section 1001 of the Code or otherwise cause a
tax to be imposed on a "prohibited transaction" by any REMIC Trust.

     (n)  Borrower shall (i) have paid, (ii) have escrowed with Lender or (iii)
be contesting in accordance with the terms hereof, all Basic Carrying Costs
relating to each of the Properties and the Substitute Property, including
without limitation, (i) accrued but unpaid insurance premiums relating to each
of the Properties and the Substitute Property, and (ii) currently due and
payable Taxes (including any in arrears) relating to each of the Properties and
the Substitute Property and (iii) currently due and payable maintenance charges
and other impositions relating to each of the Properties and Substitute
Property.

and expenses incurred by Lender (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements) in connection with the substitution and
Borrower shall have paid all recording charges, filing fees, taxes or other
expenses (including, without limitation,

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

mortgage and intangibles taxes and documentary stamp taxes) payable in
connection with the substitution. Borrower shall have paid all costs and
expenses of the Rating Agencies incurred in connection with the substitution.

     (p)  Lender shall have received annual operating statements and occupancy
statements for the Substitute Property for the most current completed fiscal
year and a current operating statement for the Release Property, each certified
by Borrower to Lender as being true and correct in all material respects and a
certificate from Borrower certifying that there has been no material adverse
change in the financial condition of the Substitute Property since the date of
such operating statements.

     (q)  Borrower shall have delivered to Lender estoppel certificates from all
tenants under Material Leases at the Substitute Property. All such estoppel
certificates shall be substantially in the form approved by Lender in connection
with the origination of the Loan and shall indicate that (1) the subject lease
is a valid and binding obligation of the tenant thereunder, (2) to the best of
the tenant's knowledge, there are no defaults under such lease on the part of
the landlord or tenant thereunder, (3) the tenant thereunder has no knowledge of
any defense or offset to the payment of rent under such leases, (4) no rent
under such lease has been paid more than one (1) month in advance, (5) the
tenant thereunder has no option under such lease to purchase all or any portion
of the Substitute Property, and (6) all tenant improvement work required under
such lease has been substantially completed and the tenant under such lease is
in actual occupancy of its leased premises. If an estoppel certificate indicates
that all tenant improvement work required under the subject lease has not yet
been completed, Borrower shall, if required by the Rating Agencies, deliver to
Lender financial statements indicating that Borrower has adequate funds to pay
all costs related to such tenant improvement work as required under such lease.

     (r)  Lender shall have received copies of all tenant leases affecting the
Substitute Property certified by Borrower as being true and correct.

     (s)  Lender shall have received subordination agreements in the form
approved by Lender in connection with the origination of the Loan (or such other
form approved by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) with respect to tenants under Material Leases at the
Substitute Property to the extent such Leases for such tenants are not
automatically subordinate (in lien and in terms) pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Leases.

     (t)  Lender shall have received (A) an endorsement to the title insurance
policy insuring the Lien of the Security Instrument encumbering the Substitute
Property insuring that the Substitute Property constitutes a separate tax lot
or, if such an endorsement is not available in the State in which the Substitute
Property is located, a letter from the title insurance company issuing such
Title Insurance Policy stating that the Substitute Policy constitutes a separate
tax lot or (B) a letter from the appropriate taxing authority stating that the
Substitute Property constitutes a separate tax lot.

     (u)  Lender shall have received a Physical Conditions Report with respect
to the Substitute Property stating that the Substitute Property and its use
comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements
(including, without limitation, zoning, subdivision and building laws) and that
the Substitute Property is in good condition and repair and free of damage or
waste.

     (v)  Lender shall have received evidence which would be satisfactory to a
prudent institutional mortgage lender to the effect that the Substitute Property
and the use thereof are in substantial compliance with all Legal Requirements
and that all material building and operating licenses and permits necessary for
the use and occupancy of the Substitute Property as a hotel including, but not
limited to, current certificates of occupancy, have been obtained and are in
full force and effect.

     (w)  In the event the Release Property is subject to a Management Agreement
along with one or more additional Properties, Lender shall have received a
certified copy of an amendment to the Management Agreement reflecting the
deletion of the Release Property and the addition of the Substitute Property as
a property managed pursuant thereto and Manager shall have executed and
delivered to Lender an amendment to the Assignment of

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

Management Agreement reflecting such amendment to the Management Agreement. In
the event that the Release Property is subject to a Management Agreement
relating only to such Release Property, Lender shall have received a certified
copy of a new Management Agreement for the Substitute Property on substantially
the same terms as the Management Agreement for the Release Property and the
Manager thereunder shall have executed and delivered to Lender an Assignment of
Management Agreement with respect to such new Management Agreement on
substantially the same terms as used in connection with the Release Property or
such other terms as would be reasonably acceptable to a prudent institutional
mortgage loan lender.

     (x)  Lender shall have received such other approvals, opinions, documents
and information in connection with the substitution as reasonably requested by

          Remaining Property, and the number of parking spaces required by the
          then applicable zoning requirements for the Remaining Property;

                                      -31-

          agreements, such legal opinions from attorneys reasonably acceptable
          to Lender and such other evidence as Lender may reasonably request or
          require to determine that the foregoing conditions have been
          satisfied;

     g.   all Leases demising any part of the Remaining Property shall remain in
          full force and effect and unaffected in any manner which would

          subordinated to any easements or access or use agreements created for
          the benefit of the Out-Parcel which was the subject of the Out-Parcel
          Release, provided said easements and/or agreements (i) are reasonably
          necessary for the operation of the Out-Parcel and (ii) do not, in the
          aggregate, materially adversely effect (A) the value or operation of

          the determination of the satisfaction of such conditions and otherwise
          incurred in connection with the Out-Parcel Release, but Borrower shall
          not be obligated to pay any release fee in connection therewith;

     l.   Borrower shall pay to Lender the Out-Parcel Release Premium;

     m.   Borrower delivers to Lender a legal opinion reasonably satisfactory to
          Lender from a law firm reasonably acceptable to Lender, stating among
          other things, that the tax qualification and status of the REMIC Trust
          will not be adversely affected or impaired as a result of the Out-
          Parcel Release; and

     n.   Borrower delivers to Lender any other documents, instruments,

calendar months immediately preceding the date of calculation is equal to or
greater than the Required Ratio and in connection with such cure Lender shall
send a notice to the Property Account Bank indicating that all of Borrower's
rights in the Property Account have been reinstated. The Required Ratio may be

posting cash collateral or a Letter of Credit in the Paydown Amount and the
performance of the Properties improve so that the Required Ratio is maintained
without the cash collateral or Letter of Credit, as applicable, Lender shall
promptly return the applicable cash collateral or Letter of Credit to Borrower
upon Borrower's written request therefor. Borrower's right to cure the
Triggering Event shall be limited to two (2) times in each calendar year. In the

good standing in each jurisdiction where it is required to be so qualified in
connection with its properties, businesses and operations. Borrower possesses
all rights, licenses, permits and authorizations, governmental or otherwise,

            -----------
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which it is a party. This Agreement and such other Loan Documents

legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower enforceable against Borrower in
accordance with their respective terms, subject only to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally, and
subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     4.1.3  No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this
            ------------
Agreement and the other Loan Documents by Borrower will not conflict with or
result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default

encumbrance (other than pursuant to the Loan Documents) upon any of the property
or assets of Borrower pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan agreement, partnership agreement, management agreement or other
material agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by which any of
Borrower's property or assets is subject, nor will such action result in any
violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of
any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over Borrower or
any of Borrower's properties or assets, and any consent, approval,
authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any

execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of this Agreement or any other

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

     4.1.4  Litigation. Except as disclosed on Schedule VIII attached hereto,
            ----------
there are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before any
Governmental Authority or other agency now pending or, to the best of Borrower's
knowledge, threatened against or affecting Borrower or any Individual Property,
which actions, suits or proceedings, if determined against Borrower or any
Individual Property, could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the condition (financial or otherwise) or business of Borrower or the condition
or ownership of any Individual Property.

     4.1.5  Agreements. Borrower is not a party to any agreement or instrument
            ----------
or subject to any restriction which could reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect Borrower or any Individual Property, or Borrower's
business, properties or assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise.
Except as disclosed on Schedule IX attached hereto, Borrower is not in default
in any material respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of
the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which Borrower or any of the Properties
are bound which could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
Borrower or any Individual Property.

     4.1.6  Solvency. Borrower (a) has not entered into the transaction or
            --------
executed the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and (b) received reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under such Loan Documents.
Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower's assets exceeds
and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower's total
liabilities, including, without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed
and contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of Borrower's assets is and
will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's
probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities
on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not
and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed
to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to incur debt and liabilities
(including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to
pay such debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing and
amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or
in respect of obligations of Borrower). Except as expressly disclosed by
Borrower to Lender in writing, no petition in bankruptcy has been filed against
Borrower or any constituent Person in the last seven (7) years, and neither
Borrower nor any constituent Person in the last seven (7) years has ever made an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any insolvency act
for the benefit of debtors. Neither Borrower nor any of its constituent Persons
are contemplating either the filing of a petition by it under any State or
federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major
portion of Borrower's assets or property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any
Person contemplating the filing of any such petition against it or such
constituent Persons.

     4.1.7  Full and Accurate Disclosure. No statement of fact made by Borrower
            ----------------------------
in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make statements contained herein or therein not misleading. There is no material
fact presently known to Borrower which has not been disclosed to Lender which
materially adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect, any Individual Property or the business, operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower, or Guarantor or Indemnitor.

     4.1.8  No Plan Assets. Borrower is not an "employee benefit plan," as
            --------------
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA, and none of the
assets of Borrower constitutes or will constitute "plan assets" of one or more
such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101. In addition, (a)
Borrower is not a "governmental plan" within the meaning of Section 3(32) of
ERISA and (b) transactions by or with Borrower are not subject to State statutes
regulating investment of, and fiduciary obligations with respect to,
governmental plans similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code currently in effect, which prohibit or otherwise restrict the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     4.1.9  Compliance. Except as expressly disclosed in the Physical Condition

any act or omission affording the federal government or any other Governmental
Authority the right of forfeiture as against any Individual Property or any part
thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's obligations under any of
the Loan Documents.

purposes prohibited by Legal Requirements or by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

encumbering the Properties (and all related obligations) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby covenants
and agrees with Lender that:

         5.1.1 Existence; Compliance with Legal Requirements. Borrower shall do
               ---------------------------------------------
or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full
force and effect its existence, rights, licenses, permits and franchises and
comply in all material respects with all Legal Requirements applicable to it and
the Properties. There shall never be committed by Borrower or any other Person

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

any Individual Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of
Borrower's obligations under any of the Loan Documents. Borrower hereby
covenants and agrees not to commit, permit or suffer to exist any act or
omission affording such right of forfeiture. Borrower shall at all times
maintain, preserve and protect all material franchises and trade names and
preserve all the remainder of its property used or useful in the conduct of its
business and shall keep the Properties in good working order and repair, and
from time to time make, or cause to be made, all reasonably necessary repairs,
renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereto, all as more fully
provided in the Security Instruments. Borrower shall keep the Properties insured
at all times by financially sound and reputable insurers, to such extent and
against such risks, and maintain liability and such other insurance, as is more
fully provided in this Agreement. After prior written notice to Lender,
Borrower, at its own expense, may contest by appropriate legal proceeding
promptly initiated and conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the
validity of any Legal Requirement, the applicability of any Legal Requirement to
Borrower or any Individual Property or any alleged violation of any Legal
Requirement, provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and remains
uncured; (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of any material instrument to which Borrower is
subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding shall
be conducted in accordance with all applicable statutes, laws and ordinances;

danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost; (iv) Borrower
shall promptly upon final determination thereof comply with any such Legal
Requirement determined to be valid or applicable or cure any violation of any
Legal Requirement; (v) such proceeding shall suspend the enforcement of the
contested Legal Requirement against Borrower or any Individual Property; and
(vi) Borrower shall furnish such security as may be required in the proceeding,
or as may be reasonably requested by Lender, to insure compliance with such
Legal Requirement, together with all interest and penalties payable in
connection therewith. Lender may apply any such security, as necessary to cause
compliance with such Legal Requirement at any time when, in the reasonable
judgment of Lender, the validity, applicability or violation of such Legal
Requirement is finally established or any Individual Property (or any part
thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, cancelled or lost.

         5.1.2 Taxes and Other Charges. Subject to Borrower's right to contest
               -----------------------

assessed or imposed against the Properties or any part thereof as the same
become due and payable; provided, however, Borrower's obligation to directly pay
Taxes shall be suspended for so long as Borrower complies with the terms and
provisions of Section 7.2 hereof. Borrower will deliver to Lender receipts for
payment or other evidence satisfactory to Lender that the Taxes and Other
Charges have been so paid or are not then delinquent no later than ten (10) days
prior to the date on which the Taxes and/or Other Charges would otherwise be
delinquent if not paid. Borrower shall furnish to Lender receipts for the
payment of the Taxes and the Other Charges prior to the date the same shall
become delinquent (provided, however, that Borrower is not required to furnish
such receipts for payment of Taxes in the event that such Taxes have been paid
by Lender pursuant to Section 7.2 hereof). Except for Permitted Encumbrances,
Borrower shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and discharged any
Lien or charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge against the
Properties, and shall promptly pay for all utility services provided to the
Properties. After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own expense,
may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and conducted in
good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity or application in
whole or in part of any Taxes or Other Charges (other than the casino franchise
fee imposed by Act No. 221 of May 15, 1948 as amended, of the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico) or any other Lien or charge that may become a Lien or charge
against an Individual Property, provided that (i) no Event of Default has
occurred and remains uncured; (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and
be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any other instrument to which
Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder and such
proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable statutes, laws
and ordinances; (iii) no Individual Property nor any part thereof or interest
therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or
lost; (iv) Borrower shall promptly upon final determination thereof pay the
amount of any such Taxes or Other Charges or the amount necessary to discharge
any Lien or satisfy any charge that may become a Lien or charge against an
Individual Property, together with all costs, interest and penalties which may
be payable in connection therewith; (v) such proceeding shall suspend the
collection of such contested Taxes or Other Charges from the applicable
Individual Property; and (vi) Borrower shall furnish such security as may be
required in the proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by Lender, to
insure the payment of any such Taxes or Other Charges or the amount necessary to
discharge any Lien or satisfy any charge that may become a Lien or charge
against an Individual Property, together with all interest and penalties

                                      -47-

thereon. Lender may pay over any such cash deposit or part thereof held by
Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the reasonable
judgment of Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is finally established or
any Individual Property (or part thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger
of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost or there shall be any
danger of the Lien of any Security Instrument being primed by any related Lien
that is not a Permitted Encumbrance.

         5.1.3 Litigation. Borrower shall give prompt written notice to Lender

and, in connection therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in
any such proceedings.

         5.1.7 Award and Insurance Benefits. Subject to the terms hereof,
               ----------------------------
Borrower shall cooperate with Lender in obtaining for Lender the benefits of any
Awards or Insurance Proceeds lawfully or equitably payable in connection with
any Individual Property, and Lender shall be reimbursed for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith (including reasonable

any Individual Property or any part thereof) out of such Award or Insurance
Proceeds.

individual basis of the Properties. Lender shall have the right from time to
time at all times during normal business hours upon reasonable advance written
notice to examine such books, records and accounts at the office of Borrower or
any other Person maintaining such books, records and accounts and to make such
copies or extracts thereof as Lender shall desire. After the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall pay any costs and

respect to the Properties, as Lender shall determine to be necessary or
appropriate in the protection of Lender's interest.

         (b) Borrower will furnish to Lender annually, within one hundred and

required information and documentation relating thereto in which to approve or
disapprove such request, provided, such request to Lender is marked in bold

          5.1.18 Management Agreement. (a) The Improvements on the Properties
                 --------------------

Replacement Management Agreement as applicable. Borrower shall (i) diligently
perform and observe in all material respects all of the terms, covenants and
conditions of the Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if
applicable, on the part of Borrower to be performed and observed to the end that
all things shall be done which are necessary to keep unimpaired the material
rights of Borrower under the Management Agreement or Replacement Management
Agreement, if applicable and (ii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of any
notice to Borrower of any material default by Borrower in the performance or

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Management
Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable on the part of
Borrower to be performed and observed and deliver to Lender a true copy of each
such notice. Borrower shall not surrender the Management Agreement or
Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable, consent to the assignment by
the Manager of its interest under the Management Agreement (except as provided
herein) or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable, or terminate or
cancel the Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if
applicable, or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the Management
Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable, in any material
respect, either orally or in writing, without the prior written consent of
Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Borrower hereby assigns to Lender as further security for the payment
of the Debt and for the performance and observance of the terms, covenants and
conditions of this Agreement, all the rights, privileges and prerogatives of
Borrower to surrender the Management Agreement or Replacement Management
Agreement, if applicable, or to terminate, cancel, modify, change, supplement,
alter or amend the Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if
applicable, in any respect, and any such surrender of the Management Agreement
or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable, or termination,
cancellation, modification, change, supplement, alteration or amendment of the
Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable, without
the prior consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, shall be void and of no force and effect. If Borrower
shall default in the performance or observance of any material term, covenant or
condition of the Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if
applicable, on the part of Borrower to be performed or observed, then, without
limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Agreement, and without
waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder, Lender
shall have the right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to
perform any act or take any action as may be appropriate to cause all the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement or Replacement Management
Agreement, if applicable, on the part of Borrower to be performed or observed to
be promptly performed or observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the
rights of Borrower in, to and under the Management Agreement or Replacement
Management Agreement, if applicable, shall be kept unimpaired and free from
default. Lender and any person designated by Lender shall have, and are hereby
granted, the right upon reasonable advance written notice to Borrower to enter
upon the applicable Individual Property at any time and from time to time for
the purpose of taking any such action. If the Manager shall deliver to Lender a
copy of any notice sent to Borrower of material default under the Management
Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable, such notice shall
constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by Lender in good faith, in reliance thereon unless such action constitutes the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of Lender or Lender's agent. Borrower
shall notify Lender if the Manager sub-contracts to a third party any or all of
its management responsibilities under the Management Agreement or Replacement
Management Agreement, if applicable. Borrower shall, from time to time, obtain
from the Manager such certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance by
Borrower with the terms of the Management Agreement or Replacement Management
Agreement, if applicable, as may be reasonably requested by Lender. Borrower
shall exercise each individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of
the Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if applicable upon
demand by Lender made at any time within one (1) year of the last day upon which
any such option may be exercised, and Borrower hereby expressly authorizes and
appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact to exercise any such option in the name of
and upon behalf of Borrower, which power of attorney shall be irrevocable and
shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest. Any sums expended by Lender
pursuant to this paragraph shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date
such cost is incurred to the date of payment to Lender, shall be deemed to
constitute a portion of the Debt, shall be secured by the lien of the Security
Instruments and the other Loan Documents and shall be immediately due and
payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

          (b)    Without limitation of the foregoing, Borrower, upon the request
of Lender, shall terminate the Management Agreement or Replacement Management
Agreement, if applicable and replace the Manager, without penalty or fee, if at
any time during the Loan: (a) the Manager shall become insolvent or a debtor in
any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, (b) provided, the Manager is an
Affiliated Manager, there exists an Event of Default which remains uncured, or
(c) there exists a default beyond all applicable notice and grace periods by
Manager under the Management Agreement or Replacement Management Agreement, if
applicable. At such time as the Manager may be removed, a Qualified Manager
shall assume management of the applicable Individual Property pursuant to a
Replacement Management Agreement.

Property is not in material compliance with all Environmental Laws, Lender and
any other person or entity designated by Lender, including but not limited to
any representative of a governmental entity, and any environmental consultant,
and any receiver appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall have

not limited to, conducting any reasonably necessary environmental assessment or
audit (the scope of which shall be determined in Lender's sole and absolute
discretion) and taking samples of soil, groundwater or other water, air, or
building materials, and conducting other invasive testing. Borrower shall
cooperate with and provide reasonable access to Lender and any such person or
entity designated by Lender.

        5.1.20  Alterations
                  -----------

        Borrower shall obtain Lender's prior written consent to any material
alterations to any Improvements, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed except with respect to alterations that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial
condition, the value of the applicable Individual Property or the annual Net
Operating Income. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender's consent shall not be required in
connection with any alterations that will not have a material adverse effect on
Borrower's financial condition, the value of the applicable Individual Property
or the Net Operating Income of such Individual Property, provided that such
alterations (a) are made in connection with tenant improvement work performed
pursuant to the terms of any Lease executed on or before the date hereof or any
Lease executed after the date hereof which is in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement, (b) are made in connection with tenant improvement work
performed pursuant to the terms and provisions of a Lease and not adversely

                                      -55-

affecting any structural component of any Improvements, any utility or HVAC
system contained in any Improvements or the exterior of any building
constituting a part of any Improvements, (c) relate solely to Equipment, (d)
relate to the conversion of any restaurant at an Individual Property to a
steakhouse operated under the Shula name (a "Shula Conversion") provided the
total cost of the Shula Conversion does not exceed $1,500,000.00 or (e) together
with the related costs thereof have been provided for in the Annual Budget which
has been approved by Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and (i) are non-
structural in nature and (ii) are budgeted to cost (including all labor and
materials) less than $500,000.00. To the extent Lender's prior written approval
is required pursuant to this Section 5.1.20, Lender shall have forty-five (45)
calendar days from receipt of written request and any and all reasonably
required information and documentation relating thereto in which to approve or
disapprove such request, provided, such request to Lender is marked in bold
lettering with the following language: "LENDER'S RESPONSE IS REQUIRED WITHIN
FORTY-FIVE (45) CALENDAR DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF
A LOAN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNDERSIGNED AND LENDER" and the envelope containing
the request must be marked "PRIORITY". In the event Lender fails to respond to
the information and proposed documentation within such time, Lender's approval
shall be deemed given. Borrower shall be required to provide Lender with such
information and documentation as may be reasonably required by Lender. Should
Lender fail to approve any such request, Lender shall give Borrower written
notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disapproval.

          5.1.21  Intentionally Omitted.
                  ---------------------

          5.1.22  The Ground Lease. (a) Borrower shall (i) pay all rents,
                  ----------------
additional rents and other sums required to be paid by Borrower, as tenant under
and pursuant to the provisions of the Ground Lease, (ii) diligently perform and
observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Ground Lease on the
part of Borrower, as tenant thereunder, (iii) promptly notify Lender of the
giving of any notice by the landlord under the Ground Lease to Borrower of any
default by Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and deliver to Lender a true copy of
each such notice within five (5) Business Days of receipt and (iv) promptly
notify Lender upon learning of any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of
the landlord under the Ground Lease or of any notice thereof, and deliver to
Lender a true copy of such notice within five (5) Business Days of Borrower's
receipt. Borrower shall not, without the prior consent of Lender, surrender the
leasehold estate created by the Ground Lease or terminate or cancel the Ground
Lease or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the Ground Lease, in any
material respect, either orally or in writing, and if Borrower shall default in
the performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
Ground Lease on the part of Borrower, as tenant thereunder, Lender shall have
the right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any
act or take any action as may be appropriate to cause all of the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Ground Lease on the part of Borrower to be
performed or observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the rights of
Borrower in, to and under the Ground Lease shall be kept unimpaired and free
from default. If the landlord under the Ground Lease shall deliver to Lender a
copy of any notice of default under the Ground Lease, such notice shall
constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by Lender, in good faith, in reliance thereon, unless Lender's action
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. Borrower shall exercise each
individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of the Ground Lease upon
demand by Lender made at any time within six (6) months prior to the last day
upon which any such option may be exercised, and Borrower hereby expressly
authorizes and appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact to exercise any such option
in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower, which power of attorney shall be
irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest.

          (b)  Subleases. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Ground Lease
               ---------
to the contrary, Borrower shall not further sublet any portion of the related
Individual Property (other than as permitted pursuant to Section 5.1.17 hereof)
without prior written consent of Lender. Each sublease hereafter made shall
provide that, (a) in the event of the termination of the Ground Lease, the lease
shall not terminate or be terminable by the lessee; (b) in the event of any
action for the foreclosure of the Security Instrument with respect to the
related Individual Property, the lease shall not terminate or be terminable by
the subtenant by reason of the termination of the Ground Lease unless the lessee
is specifically named and joined in any such action and unless a judgment is
obtained therein against the lessee; and (c) in the event that the Ground Lease
is terminated as aforesaid, the lessee shall attorn to the lessor under the
Ground Lease or to the purchaser at the sale of the related Individual Property
on such foreclosure, as the case may be. In the event that any portion of such
Individual Property shall be sublet pursuant to the terms of this subsection,
such sublease shall be deemed to be included in the Individual Property.

or terminate any material provision of its organizational documents or its
qualification and good standing in any jurisdiction or (e) cause the Principal

liquidated in whole or in part, or (ii) amend, modify, waive or terminate the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Principal, in each case, without

law, rule or regulation, without the prior consent of Lender, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

     5.2.6  No Joint Assessment. Borrower shall not suffer, permit or

charged to such Individual Property.

            ---------------------------
principal place of business set forth in Schedule XVIII without first giving
Lender thirty (30) days prior written notice. Borrower shall not change the
place of its organization as set forth in Section 4.1.34 without the consent of
Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall execute and deliver additional

<PAGE>

evidence or perfect Lender's security interest in the Property as a result of
such change of place of business or place of organization.

     5.2.8  ERISA. (a) Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which
            -----
would cause any obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the

class exemption) prohibited transaction under ERISA.

     (b)  Borrower further covenants and agrees to deliver to Lender such
certifications or other evidence from time to time throughout the term of the
Loan, as requested by Lender in its sole discretion, that (A) Borrower is not

with an Affiliate of Borrower or any of the partners of Borrower except in the

            ------
the Properties.

hereof, without (i) the prior written consent of Lender and (ii) if a

estate similar to the Properties, (v) the merger or consolidation of Wyndham (or
its successors), provided that the surviving entity of such merger or
consolidation is (or is controlled by) (A) a Public Company and (B) primarily

rights shall materially impair the utility and/or operation of an Individual
Property or any Maker's ability to repay the Debt as it becomes due and (vii)
transfers of direct or indirect interests in any Borrower or Principal to
Affiliates of Wyndham (or its successors) provided that after such transfers
such Borrower and Principal are controlled, directly or indirectly, by Wyndham
(or its successors). In addition, on a one time basis, Wyndham may merge or
consolidate with a public or private entity in which the surviving entity is not
and is not controlled by a Public Company provided that (a) after such merger,
each Borrower and Principal shall continue to comply with the terms of Section
4.1.35 hereof, (b) such merger or consolidation does not result in a Change of

after such transfer or merger, more than 49% of any direct legal or beneficial
interest in Borrower (or in any constituent entity of Borrower that is required
to comply with the terms of Section 4.1.35 hereof) is owned by a new or
successor entity. Such Additional Insolvency Opinion shall be reasonably
acceptable to (a) Lender, prior to a Securitization or (b) the Rating Agencies,
if a Securitization has occurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, pledges and hypothecations of indirect equity interests in
Borrower shall be permitted provided (i) Wyndham (or its successor) maintains
control of, and holds beneficial ownership interests of not less than fifty-one
percent (51%) of the membership interests or partnership interests, as
applicable, in, each entity comprising Borrower and (ii) any such pledges or
hypothecations are in connection with that certain Credit Agreement between
Wyndham (or its successors) and The Chase Manhattan Bank dated June 30, 1999, as
amended or another credit agreement with an Institutional Lender, which
Institutional Lender shall be making or holding a loan to Wyndham or its
successor or its Affiliates (other than Borrower or Principal). A foreclosure
sale (or transfer in lieu thereof) of any such pledge or hypothecation to The
Chase Manhattan Bank, or another Institutional Lender as collateral agent for
syndicate lenders or another Institutional Lender, shall be permitted provided
(i) Lender is given at least sixty (60) days prior written notice of the
proposed foreclosure sale or transfer in lieu thereof; (ii) the

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

transferee is a reputable entity or person, creditworthy, with sufficient
financial worth considering any obligations assumed and undertaken with respect
to the Loan, as evidenced by financial statements and other information
reasonably requested by Lender; (iii) the Properties at all times shall continue
to be managed by a Qualified Manager; and (iv) and any and all such entities
will comply with all of the requirements set forth in the Note, this Agreement,
the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents.

                  (d) Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual
impairment of its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in order
to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon a Transfer without Lender's
consent to the extent required hereunder. This provision shall apply to every
Transfer regardless of whether voluntary or not, or whether or not Lender has
consented to any previous Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 5.2.12 in the event any transfer (whether or not such
transfer shall constitute a Transfer) results in any Person owning in excess of
forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership interest in a Restricted Party,
Borrower shall, prior to such transfer, deliver a substantive non-consolidation
opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and substance
reasonably acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.2.12, Lender shall not withhold its consent to a one-time sale,
assignment, or other transfer of all of the Properties provided that (i) Lender
receives sixty (60) days prior written notice of such transfer, (ii) no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and (iii) upon the satisfaction (in the
reasonable determination of Lender) of the following matters:

                         (A) Borrower or Transferee (defined below) shall pay
                             any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
                             in connection with the transfer (including, without
                             limitation, Lender's reasonable counsel fees and
                             disbursements and all recording fees, title
                             insurance premiums and mortgage and intangible
                             taxes);

                         (B) The proposed transferee (the "Transferee") shall be
                             a special purpose bankruptcy remote entity that
                             complies with all of the requirements of Section
                             4.1.35 and is controlled by a Qualified Transferee;

                         (C) Transferee shall assume all of the obligations of
                             Borrower under the Note, this Agreement, the
                             Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents
                             in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Lender in
                             all respects, including, without limitation, by
                             entering into an assumption agreement in form and
                             substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender and
                             delivering such legal opinions as Lender may
                             reasonably require;

                         (D) The Properties shall be managed by a Qualified
                             Manager following such transfer;

                         (E) Intentionally Omitted;

                         (F) To the extent available in the applicable
                             jurisdiction, Transferee shall deliver an
                             endorsement to the existing title policy insuring
                             the Security Instruments as modified by the
                             assumption agreement, as a valid first lien on each
                             Individual Property and naming the Transferee as
                             owner of the fee or leasehold estate, as
                             applicable, of each Individual Property, which
                             endorsement shall insure that as of the recording
                             of the assumption agreement, each Individual
                             Property shall not be subject to any additional
                             exceptions or Liens other than Permitted
                             Encumbrances; and

                         (G) Transferee shall deliver to Lender an opinion of
                             counsel from an independent law firm with respect
                             to the substantive non-consolidation of Transferee
                             and its constituent entities (partners, members or
                             shareholders), which law firm and which opinion
                             shall be reasonably satisfactory in all respects to
                             (i) Lender, if a

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

               Securitization has not occurred, or (ii) Lender and the Rating
               Agencies, if a Securitization has occurred.

     (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.2.12, Lender's consent shall not be required for the financing of personal
property, including, without limitation, furniture, fixtures and equipment owned
or to be purchased by the applicable Maker (other than W-Baltimore, LLC) or
Maryland Guarantor that is used in connection with the operation of the
Properties ("Equipment"), provided Lender has received prior written
notification of such Maker's or Maryland Guarantor's, as applicable, intent to
finance such Equipment, and provided, further, that (i) any such financing is
subject to commercially prudent terms and conditions and at a market rate of
interest, (ii) the Equipment financed is readily replaceable without material
interference or interruption to the operation of the Properties as required
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Instruments and
the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the aggregate principal amount of such
financing for Equipment located on or used in connection with each Individual
Property is at all times less than the amount set forth on Schedule VI attached
hereto and made a part hereof for each such Individual Property ("Permitted FF&E
Financing") and (iv) the financing does not create a lien on any Properties
other than the Equipment financed.

     VI.  INSURANCE; CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION; REQUIRED REPAIRS
          ---------------------------------------------------

     Section 6.1 Insurance. (a) Borrower shall obtain and maintain, or cause
                 ---------
to be maintained, Policies for Borrower and the Properties providing at least
the following coverages:

          (i)    comprehensive all risk insurance on the Improvements and the
     Personal Property, in each case (ii) in an amount equal to 100% of the
     "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this Agreement shall mean
     actual replacement value (exclusive of costs of excavations, foundations,
     underground utilities and footings) with a waiver of depreciation, but the
     amount shall in no event be less than the outstanding principal balance of
     the Note; (iii) containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect to the
     Improvements and Personal Property waiving all co-insurance provisions;
     (iv) providing for no deductible in excess of $100,000; and (v) providing
     coverage for contingent liability from Operation of Building Laws,
     Demolition Costs and Increased Cost of Construction Endorsements together
     with an "Ordinance or Law Coverage" or "Enforcement" endorsement if any of
     the Improvements or the use of each Individual Property shall at any time
     constitute legal non-conforming structures or uses. The Full Replacement
     Cost shall be redetermined from time to time (but not more frequently than
     once in any twenty (24) calendar months) at the request of Lender by an
     appraiser or contractor designated and paid by Borrower and approved by
     Lender, or by an engineer or appraiser in the regular employ of the
     insurer. After the first appraisal, additional appraisals may be based on
     construction cost indices customarily employed in the trade. No omission on
     the part of Lender to request any such ascertainment shall relieve Borrower
     of any of its obligations under this Subsection;

          (ii)   commercial general liability insurance against claims for
     personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in
     or about each Individual Property, including "Dram Shop" or other liquor
     liability coverage if alcoholic beverages are sold from or may be consumed
     at an Individual Property, such insurance (A) to be on the so-called
     "occurrence" form with a combined single limit of not less than $15,000,000
     (and if in a blanket policy, containing an "Aggregate Per Location"
     endorsement); (B) to continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until
     required to be changed by Lender in writing by reason of changed economic
     conditions making such protection inadequate; and (C) to cover at least the
     following hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) products and completed
     operations on an "if any" basis; (3) independent contractors; (4) blanket
     contractual liability for all legal contracts; and (5) contractual
     liability covering the indemnities contained in Article 10 of the Security
     Instruments to the extent the same is available;

          (iii)  business interruption/loss of rents insurance (A) with loss
     payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks required to be covered by the
     insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a)(i); (C) in an amount equal to 100%
     of the projected gross income from each Individual Property for a period of
     twenty four (24) months. The amount of such loss of rents insurance shall
     be determined prior to the date hereof and at least once each year
     thereafter based on the greatest of: (x) Borrower's reasonable estimate of
     the gross income from each

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

     Individual Property (y) the estimate of gross income set forth in the
     Annual Budget; and (z) the highest gross income received during the term of
     the Note for any full calendar year prior to the date the amount of such
     insurance is being determined, for the succeeding twenty-four month period.
     All insurance proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this Section
     6.1(a)(iii) shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to the obligations
     secured hereunder from time to time due and payable hereunder and under the
     Note and of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein
     contained shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the
     obligations secured hereunder on the respective dates of payment provided
     for in this Agreement except to the extent such amounts are actually paid
     out of the proceeds of such loss of rents insurance and (D) containing an
     extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides that after the
     physical loss to the Improvements and the Personal Property has been
     repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until such income
     returns to the same level it was prior to the loss, or the expiration of
     twenty-four (24) months from the date of the loss, whichever first occurs,
     and notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such
     period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the payment of all sums
     that are then due and payable under the Note, this Agreement and the other
     Loan Documents, Lender shall disburse to Borrower any remaining proceeds
     from business interruption insurance obtained under this Section
     6.1(a)(iii);

         (iv)    at all times during which structural construction, repairs or
     alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements (A) owner's
     contingent or protective liability insurance covering claims not covered by
     or under the terms or provisions of the above mentioned commercial general
     liability insurance policy; and (B) the insurance provided for in Section
     6.1(a)(i) written in a so-called builder's risk completed value form (1) on
     a non-reporting basis, (2) against all risks insured against pursuant to
     Section 6.1(a)(i), (3) including permission to occupy each Individual
     Property, and (4) with an agreed amount endorsement waiving co-insurance
     provisions;

         (v)     workers' compensation, subject to the statutory limits of the
     State in which each Individual Property is located, and employer's
     liability insurance with a limit of at least $1,000,000 per accident and
     per disease per employee, and $1,000,000 for disease aggregate in respect
     of any work or operations on or about each Individual Property, or in
     connection with such Individual Property or its operation (if applicable);

         (vi)    comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if applicable, in
     amounts as shall be reasonably required by Lender on terms consistent with
     the insurance required under Section 6.1(a)(i) hereof;

         (vii)   if any portion of the Improvements is at any time located in an
     area identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or any
     successor thereto as an area having special flood hazards pursuant to the
     National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
     1973 or the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may be
     amended, or any successor law (the "Flood Insurance Acts"), flood hazard
     insurance in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the principal balance of
     the Note, and (B) the maximum limit of coverage available for the Property
     under the Flood Insurance Acts;

         (viii)  earthquake, sinkhole and mine subsidence insurance, if required
     by Lender in amounts equal to one time (1x) the probable maximum loss of
     each Individual Property as determined by Lender in its sole discretion and
     in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, provided that the insurance
     pursuant to this Section 6.1(a)(viii) hereof shall be on terms consistent
     with the all risk insurance policy required under Section 6.1(a)(i) hereof;

         (ix)    umbrella liability insurance in an amount not less than ONE
     HUNDRED MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($100,000,000.00) per occurrence on
     terms consistent with the commercial general liability insurance policy
     required under Section (ii) above;

         (x)     a blanket fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance
     coverage insuring against losses resulting from dishonest or fraudulent
     acts committed by (A) Borrower's personnel; (B) any employees of outside
     firms that provide appraisal, legal, data processing or other services for
     Borrower or (C) temporary contract employees or student interns;

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

          (xi)   with respect to the San Juan Property only, Caribbean wind
     storm insurance consistent with the requirements hereof, but providing for
     a deductible not greater than two percent (2%) and

          (xii)  upon sixty (60) days prior written notice, such other
     reasonable insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to
     time may reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at
     the time are commonly insured against for property similar to each
     Individual Property located in or around the region in which the each
     Individual Property is located.

     (b)  All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof shall be
obtained under valid and enforceable policies (the "Policies" or in the
singular, the "Policy"), in such forms and, from time to time after the date
hereof, in such amounts as may be reasonably satisfactory to Lender, issued by
financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized to do business
in the State in which each Individual Property is located and approved by
Lender. The insurance companies must have a claims paying ability/financial
strength rating of "AA" (or its equivalent) or better by at least two (2) Rating
Agencies (one of which will be S&P if they are rating the Securities and one of
which shall be Moody's if they are rating the Securities), or if only one Rating
Agency is rating the Securities, then only by such Rating Agency (each such
insurer shall be referred to below as a "Qualified Insurer"). Not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of the Policies theretofore
furnished to Lender pursuant to Section 6.1(a), Borrower shall deliver certified
copies of the Policies marked "premium paid" or accompanied by evidence
satisfactory to Lender of payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "Insurance
Premiums"), provided, however, that in the case of renewal Policies, Borrower
may furnish Lender with binders therefor to be followed by the original Policies
when issued. If Borrower's insurers or reinsurance carriers fail to provide or
maintain such a rating, Borrower may satisfy the ratings requirement of this
Section by providing to Lender a "cut-through" endorsement in form and substance
approved by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, issued by an insurer with at least an "AA" rating by
S&P.

     (c)  Except to the extent required pursuant to Section 6.1(a) hereof,
Borrower shall not obtain any umbrella or blanket liability or casualty Policy,
unless such Policy shall specifically allocate to each Individual Property the
amount of coverage required hereunder and shall otherwise provide the same
protection as would a separate Policy insuring only such Individual Property in
compliance with the terms of Section 6.1(a) hereof.

     (d)  All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 6.1(a) hereof,
except for the Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as
the insured and Lender as additional insured, as their respective interests may
appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler and machinery, and flood
insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing
mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be
payable to Lender.

     (e)  All Policies provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof shall contain
clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

          (i)    no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for
     Borrower, or of any tenant under any Lease or other occupant, or failure to
     comply with the provisions of any Policy which might otherwise result in a
     forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect
     the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is
     concerned;

          (ii)   the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to
     increase the coverage provided thereby) or cancelled without at least 30
     days' written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an
     additional insured; and

          (iii)  each Policy shall provide that the issuers thereof shall give
     written notice to Lender if the Policy has not been renewed thirty (30)
     days prior to its expiration; and

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

          (iv)   Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon
     or subject to any assessments thereunder.

     (f)  Upon written request by Lender, Borrower shall furnish to Lender, on
or before thirty (30) days after the close of each of Borrower's fiscal years,
an Officer's Certificate certifying of the amounts of insurance maintained in
compliance herewith, of the risks covered by such insurance and of the insurance
company or companies which carry such insurance and, if requested by Lender,
verification of the adequacy of such insurance by an independent insurance
broker or appraiser acceptable to Lender.

     (g)  If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all
insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the
right to take such action as Lender deems necessary to protect its interest in
the Properties, including, without limitation, the obtaining of such insurance
coverage as Lender in its sole discretion deems appropriate after five (5)
Business Days' written notice to Borrower if prior to the date upon which any
such coverage will lapse or at any time Lender deems necessary (regardless of
prior written notice to Borrower) to avoid a lapse of such coverage. All
expenses incurred by Lender in connection with such action or in obtaining such
insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by Borrower to Lender upon
demand and until paid shall be secured by the Security Instruments and shall
bear interest at the Default Rate.

     (h)  In the event of a foreclosure of any of the Security Instruments, or
other transfer of title to any Individual Property in extinguishment in whole or
in part of the Debt all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to such
policies then in force concerning the Properties (unless such policies are
blanket policies insuring real property in addition to the Properties) and all
proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such
foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of such other transfer of
title and such party shall notify the insurer thereof.

     Section 6.2  Casualty. If the Individual Property shall be damaged or
                  --------
destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire or other casualty (a "Casualty"),
Borrower shall give prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly
commence and diligently prosecute the completion of the Restoration of the
Individual Property in accordance with Section 6.4. Borrower shall pay all costs
of such Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender
may, but shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by
Borrower.

     Section 6.3  Condemnation. Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of
                  ------------
the actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of
all or any part of any Individual Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of
any and all papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may
participate in any such proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time
deliver to Lender all instruments requested by it to permit such participation.
Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and
shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in
the carrying on or defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking
by any public or quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise
(including, but not limited to, any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation
of the exercise of such taking), Maker shall continue to pay the Debt at the
time and in the manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this
Agreement and the Debt shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been
actually received and applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of
collection, to the reduction or discharge of the Debt in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the
Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the
Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note. If any
Individual Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the
applicable Individual Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of
Section 6.4. If any Individual Property is sold, through foreclosure or
otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the
right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Note shall have been sought,
recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to
pay the Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision herein to
the contrary, Borrower's obligation to commence and pursue Restoration of an
Individual Property shall not be deemed to obligate Borrower to acquire any
additional land to substitute for any portion of any Individual Property which
may be taken by Condemnation.

          Section 6.4  Restoration. The following provisions shall apply in
                       -----------
connection with the Restoration of any Individual Property:

          (a)  In the event that the projected Net Proceeds and the costs of
completing the Restoration are each less than the Threshold Amount, Borrower may
settle and adjust any claim without the consent of Lender and agree with the
insurance company or companies on the amount to be paid upon the loss; provided
that such adjustment is carried out in a competent and timely manner. Provided
that all of the conditions set forth in Subsections (A), (D), (F), (G), (I) and
(J) of Section 6.4(b)(i) hereof are met and Borrower delivers to Lender a
written undertaking to expeditiously commence and satisfactorily complete with
due diligence the Restoration in accordance with the terms herein, Borrower is
hereby authorized to collect and receive any such Insurance Proceeds and apply
them to the costs of the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

          (b)  In the event that either the projected Net Proceeds or the costs
of completing the Restoration are either equal to or exceed the Threshold Amount
Borrower may settle and adjust any claim with the prior consent of Lender, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, that (A) if Borrower has not commenced or diligently pursued the claims
process with the applicable insurance company or companies and as a result
thereof, Lender takes over the claims process as provided in Section 6.2, then
Lender may settle and adjust such claims in a reasonable and expeditious manner
and (B) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may settle and adjust any claim without the consent of Borrower. In such
events, Borrower or Lender, as the case may be, may agree with the insurance
company or companies on the amount to be paid on the loss. All reasonable
efforts will be made to ensure that the proceeds of any such policy shall be
paid solely to Lender but, if for any reason Borrower or Wyndham shall also be a
dual payee, then Borrower and/or Wyndham, as applicable, shall endorse and/or
deliver to Lender all such proceeds within three (3) Business Days following
Borrower's and/or Wyndham's, as applicable, receipt thereof, and provided no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall make the Net
Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance with this Section 6.4. The
term "Net Proceeds" for purposes of this Section 6.4 shall mean: (i) the net
amount of all insurance proceeds received pursuant to Section 6.1 (a)(i), (iv),
(vi), (vii) and (viii) as a result of such damage or destruction, after
deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting same ("Insurance Proceeds"), or
(ii) the net amount of the Award, after deduction of reasonable costs and
expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in
collecting same ("Condemnation Proceeds"), whichever the case may be, plus (in
the case of (i) and (ii) above) any interest or other income earned on the
investment of the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms hereof.

               (i)   The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
          Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                     (A)  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                          continuing;

                     (B)  (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance
                          Proceeds, less than forty percent (40%) of the total
                          floor area of the Improvements on the Individual
                          Property has been materially damaged, destroyed and
                          rendered unusable for a period of at least thirty (30)
                          calendar days as a result of such fire or other
                          casualty or (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                          Condemnation Proceeds, less than ten percent (10%) of
                          the land constituting the Individual Property is
                          taken, and such land is located along the perimeter or
                          periphery of the Individual Property, and no portion
                          of the Improvements is located on such land;

                     (C)  Intentionally Omitted;

                     (D)  Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
                          reasonably practicable (but, subject to Force Majeure,
                          in no event later than thirty (30) days after such
                          Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be,
                          occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to
                          satisfactory completion (Restoration shall be deemed

                          if Borrower elects to do so or, if, in the
                          commercially reasonable judgement of Lender, an
                          architect is necessary and the commencing of cleaning
                          of the applicable Individual Property to effectuate
                          Restoration);

                     (E)  Lender shall be reasonably satisfied that any
                          operating deficits, including all scheduled payments
                          of principal and interest under the Note, which will
                          be incurred with respect to the Individual Property as
                          a result of the occurrence of any such Casualty or
                          Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be
                          covered out of (1) the Net Proceeds, (2) the insurance
                          coverage referred to in Section 6.1(a)(iii), if
                          applicable, or (3) by other funds of Borrower
                          including funds reasonably anticipated by Lender to be
                          generated from the operation of the Properties during
                          the Restoration;

                     (F)  Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
                          substantially completed on or before the earliest to
                          occur of (1) six (6) months prior to the Maturity
                          Date, or (2) twelve (12) months after the occurrence
                          of such fire or other casualty, or (3) the earliest
                          date required for such completion under the terms of
                          the Management Agreement or (4) such time as may be
                          required under applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule
                          or regulation in order to repair and restore the
                          applicable Individual Property to the condition it was
                          in immediately prior to such Casualty or Condemnation
                          or (5) the expiration of the insurance coverage
                          referred to in Section 6.1(a)(iii) unless Borrower has

                          Lender that Borrower has sufficient funds after the
                          expiration of such insurance to (1) operate the
                          Properties in a manner consistent with the manner in
                          which the Properties were operated immediately prior
                          to such Casualty or Condemnation and (2) pay all sums
                          as they become due under the Loan Documents in a

                     (G)  the Individual Property and the use thereof after the
                          Restoration will be in compliance in all material
                          respects with and permitted under all applicable
                          zoning laws, ordinances, rules and regulations;

                     (H)  the Restoration shall be done and completed by
                          Borrower in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                          compliance with all applicable governmental laws,
                          rules and regulations (including, without limitation,
                          all applicable environmental laws) and the terms and
                          condition of the Management Agreement;

                     (I)  such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not
                          result in the permanent loss of access to any material
                          portion of the Individual Property or the related
                          Improvements;

                     (J)  Lender shall be reasonably satisfied that the
                          projected Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the affected
                          Individual Property for the twelve (12) month period
                          beginning three (3) months after the completion of the
                          Restoration, shall be equal to or greater than the
                          Debt Service Coverage Ratio for such Individual
                          Property for the twelve (12) full calendar months
                          immediately prior to the Closing Date;

                     (K)  If the Net Proceeds or the cost of Restoration is
                          reasonably anticipated by Lender to exceed the
                          Threshold Amount, Borrower shall deliver, or cause to
                          be delivered, to Lender a signed reasonably detailed
                          initial budget containing Borrower*s reasonable
                          estimates of the cost of completing the Restoration
                          and shall furnish to Lender no less frequently than
                          one time each calendar month an updated budget

                                      -66-
<PAGE>

                          prepared by Borrower containing all revisions and
                          refinements to such budget and the amounts incurred
                          through the date of such budget. Such initial budget
                          and all subsequent budgets shall be reasonably
                          acceptable to Lender;

                     (L)  the Net Proceeds received and reasonably estimated to
                          be received together with any cash or cash equivalent
                          (including any Letter of Credit received by Lender)
                          deposited by Borrower with Lender are sufficient in
                          Lender's reasonable discretion to cover the cost of
                          the Restoration and uncompleted Replacements (to the
                          extent provided in the next sentence). If and to the
                          extent that the Restoration includes Replacements
                          which were included in the Annual Budget for the year
                          in which the Casualty occurred or which were or would
                          reasonably be expected to be included in the Annual
                          Budget for the immediately following year in which the
                          Casualty occurred, then Borrower shall be given a
                          credit for having made the actual expenditures for
                          such Replacements as and when such expenditures are
                          made during the course of Restoration; and

                    (M)   the Management Agreement in effect as of the date of
                          the occurrence of such fire or other casualty or
                          taking, whichever the case may be, shall (1) remain in
                          full force and effect during the Restoration and shall
                          not otherwise terminate as a result of the fire, other
                          casualty or the Restoration or (2) if terminated,
                          shall have been replaced with a Replacement Management
                          Agreement with a Qualified Manager, prior to the
                          opening or reopening of the applicable Individual
                          Property or any portion thereof for business with the
                          public.

               (ii)  The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an interest-
     bearing Eligible Account (provided, however, Borrower may instruct Lender
     to invest the Net Proceeds in Permitted Investments, provided, that all
     risks relating thereto shall be borne solely by Borrower) and, until
     disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), shall
     constitute additional security for the Debt and other obligations under the
     Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as
     directed by, Borrower from time to time during the course of the
     Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A) all
     materials installed and work and labor performed (except to the extent that
     they are to be paid for out of the requested disbursement) in connection
     with the Restoration have been paid for in full, and (B) there exist no
     notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or
     notices of intention to file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of
     any nature whatsoever (except for Liens being contested in good faith in
     accordance with the terms hereof) on the Individual Property which have not
     either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and discharged of
     record or in the alternative fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by
     the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy.

               (iii) All plans and specifications (to the extent reasonably
     required by Borrower) required in connection with a Restoration reasonably
     anticipated by Lender to cost in excess of $1,000,000.00 shall be subject
     to prior review and acceptance in all respects by Lender (which acceptance
     shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and by an
     independent consulting engineer selected by Lender and reasonably
     acceptable to Borrower (the "Casualty Consultant"). Borrower may require
     the Casualty Consultant to execute reasonably requested confidentiality
     agreements with respect to Borrower's confidential non-public information
     provided such agreements are customarily given for similarly situated
     properties. Lender shall have the use of the plans and specifications and
     all permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with
     the Restoration. The identity of the contractors, subcontractors and
     materialmen providing work and/or materials in excess of $500,000.00 in
     connection with a Restoration, as well as the contracts under which they
     have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by
     Lender and the Casualty Consultant, such acceptance mot to be unreasonably
     withheld, conditioned or delayed. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
     expenses incurred by Lender in connection with making the Net Proceeds
     available for the Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable
     counsel fees and disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees, shall be
     paid by Borrower.

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

               (iv)  In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements
     of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
     incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as
     certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage. The
     term "Casualty Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
     of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
     Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, until the Restoration
     has been completed; provided, however, to the extent that retainer fees and
     other advances paid or payable to contractors, consultants and/or engineers
     constitute an approved loss by the applicable insurance company or
     companies and Insurance Proceeds have been received with respect to such
     fees, provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
     Lender will permit such amounts to be paid or reimbursed to Borrower from
     the Net Proceeds to the extent such Insurance Proceeds have actually been
     received by Lender, without any such Casualty Retainage. The Casualty
     Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     set forth above in this Section 6.4(b), be less than the amount actually
     held back by Borrower from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen
     engaged in the Restoration. The Casualty Retainage shall not be released
     until the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has
     been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and
     that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Individual
     Property have been obtained from all appropriate governmental and quasi-
     governmental authorities, and Lender receives evidence reasonably
     satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid in
     full or will be paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage; provided,
     however, that Lender will release the portion of the Casualty Retainage
     being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or materialman
     engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon which the Casualty
     Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor, subcontractor or
     materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and has supplied all
     materials in accordance with the provisions of the contractor's,
     subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the contractor, subcontractor or
     materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of
     (subject to receipt of the applicable Casualty Retainage) all sums due to
     the contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested
     by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy for
     the related Individual Property, and Lender, upon its reasonable request,
     receives an endorsement to such Title Insurance Policy insuring the
     continued priority of the Lien of the related Security Instrument and
     evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If
     required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Casualty
     Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has issued
     a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor
     or materialman.

               (v)   Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the
     Net Proceeds more frequently than (a) once every seven (7) calendar days
     during the first (30) calendar days following a Casualty, (b) once every
     fourteen (14) calendar days during the next one hundred eighty (180)
     calendar days and (c) once every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter.

               (vi)  If at any time the Net Proceeds (including a reasonable
     estimate of the amount to be received as Restoration progresses) or the
     undisbursed balance thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender
     in consultation with the Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full
     the balance of the costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to
     be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration based upon
     the then current budget for the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the
     amount of the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency") with Lender (which
     deposit may be made in the form of a Letter of Credit) before any further
     disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency
     deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be disbursed for
     costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration on the same
     conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so
     disbursed pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute additional
     security for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

               (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
     balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after
     the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
     substantially completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section
     6.4(b), and

                                      -68-
<PAGE>

          the receipt by Lender of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender
          that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been
          paid in full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no
          Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing.

          (c)  All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 6.4(b)(vii) may be retained and applied by Lender toward the payment
of either (or both) (1) any then outstanding portion of the Debt or (2) the
principal balance of the Debt whether or not then due and payable, in either
case in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion
shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either
in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall approve, in
its discretion. If Lender shall receive and retain Net Proceeds, the Lien of the
Security Instruments shall be reduced only by the amount thereof received and
retained by Lender and actually applied by Lender in reduction of the Debt.

          (d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.4 to the
contrary, a portion of the Net Proceeds not to exceed $2,500,000.00 shall be
made available to Borrower after receipt thereof by Lender or Borrower, as
applicable, to pay or reimburse Borrower for any immediate and necessary repairs
or other work required (i) to protect the health or safety of any hotel guest or
any of Borrower's employees or agents or (ii) to allow the applicable Individual
Property to operate as a hotel (collectively, the "Emergency Repairs") provided
(A) Lender has approved such Emergency Repairs in writing, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (B) the Emergency
Repairs are (1) substantially completed and paid for within ten (10) calendar
days after the occurrence of the Casualty and (2) completed in a good and
workman like manner and in compliance with all Applicable Laws.

          VII. RESERVE FUNDS
               -------------

          Section 7.1   Required Repair Funds.
                        ---------------------

          7.1.1  Deposits. Borrower shall perform the repairs at the Properties,
                 --------
as more particularly set forth on Schedule III hereto (such repairs hereinafter
referred to as "Required Repairs"). Borrower shall complete the Required Repairs
on or before the required deadline for each repair as set forth on Schedule III,
subject to such extensions as required due to Force Majeure. It shall be an
Event of Default under this Agreement if (a) Borrower does not complete the
Required Repairs at each Individual Property by the required deadline for each
repair as set forth on Schedule III, or (b) Borrower does not satisfy each
condition contained in Section 7.1.2 hereof in all material respects. Upon the
occurrence of such an Event of Default, Lender, at its option, may withdraw all
Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account and Lender may apply such
funds either to completion of the Required Repairs at one or more of the
Properties or toward payment of the Debt in such order, proportion and priority
as Lender may determine in its sole discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and
apply Required Repair Funds shall be in addition to all other rights and
remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
If Borrower does not complete the Required Repairs on or before the required
deadline for each repair, Borrower shall deposit with Lender, immediately upon
request by Lender, an amount for each Individual Property equal to 125% of the
cost of any remaining or incomplete Required Repair for each such Individual
Property (collectively, the "Required Deposit"). Amounts so deposited with
Lender shall be held by Lender in accordance with Section 7.7 hereof. Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "Required Repair Fund."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of depositing the Required Deposit,
Borrower shall have the option of delivering to Lender a Letter of Credit in the
amount of the Required Deposit.

          7.1.2  Release of Required Repair Funds. Provided Borrower has
                 --------------------------------
deposited funds in the Required Repair Fund, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
the Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account from time to time
upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following conditions: (a) Borrower
shall submit a written request for payment to Lender at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the date on which Borrower requests such payment be made and specifies
the Required Repairs to be paid, (b) on the date such request is received by
Lender and on the date such payment is to be made, no Event of Default shall
exist and remain uncured, (c) Lender shall have received an Officers'
Certificate (i) stating that all Required Repairs at the applicable Individual
Property to be funded by the requested disbursement have been completed in good
and workmanlike manner (or any materials to be reimbursed by the

                                      -69-
<PAGE>

requested disbursement are on site at the Individual Property or in a bonded
warehouse reasonably acceptable to Lender and are properly secured or have been
installed in the Individual Property) and in accordance with all Legal
Requirements and Environmental Laws, such certificate to be accompanied by a
copy of any license, permit or other approval by any Governmental Authority
required to commence and/or complete such Required Repairs, (ii) identifying
each Person that supplied materials or labor in connection with the Required
Repairs performed at such Individual Property with respect to the reimbursement
to be funded by the requested disbursement, and (iii) stating that each such
Person has been paid in full all sums then due upon such disbursement, such
Officers' Certificate to be accompanied by lien waivers or other evidence of
payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender, (d) at Lender's option, a title
search for such Individual Property indicating that such Individual Property is
free from all liens, claims and other encumbrances not previously approved by
Lender, and (e) Lender shall have received such other evidence as Lender shall
reasonably request that the Required Repairs at such Individual Property to be
funded by the requested disbursement (or any materials to be reimbursed by the
requested disbursement are on site at the Individual Property or in a bonded
warehouse reasonably acceptable to Lender and are properly secured or have been
installed in the Individual Property) have been completed and are paid for upon
such disbursement to Borrower. Lender shall not be required to make
disbursements from the Required Repair Account with respect to any Individual
Property unless such requested disbursement is in an amount greater than $25,000
(or a lesser amount if the total amount in the Required Repair Account is less
than $25,000, in which case only one disbursement of the amount remaining in the
account shall be made). Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, any funds remaining in the Required Repairs Account after completion
of all Required Repairs and the delivery of evidence thereof in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be disbursed to Borrower.

          Section 7.2  Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Borrower shall pay to
                       -----------------------------
Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes (the "Monthly Tax
Deposit") that Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve
(12) months in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such
Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to their respective due dates, and (b)
one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums (the "Monthly Insurance Premium Deposit")
that Lender estimates will be payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded
by the Policies, with respect to, and allocable to the Properties upon the
expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay
all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of
the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund"). The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and the payments of
interest or principal or both, payable pursuant to the Note and this Agreement,
shall be added together and shall be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to
Lender. Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes
and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.1.2
and 6.1 hereof. In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured
from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent
(with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof, provided, however, Borrower
shall have the right to contest the same in good faith and in accordance with
the terms hereof. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall
exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section
5.1.2 and 6.1 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to
Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund
after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. In
allocating such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of
Lender to be the owner of the Properties. If at any time Lender reasonably
determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be
sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and
(b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall
increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender estimates is
sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days prior to
delinquency of the Taxes and/or thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the
Policies, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of making
the Monthly Insurance Premium Deposit, Borrower shall have the option of (i)
delivering to Lender a Letter of Credit in an amount equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the estimated annual Insurance Premium, as the same is
calculated each year during the term of the Loan or (ii) providing evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the liability or casualty Policy
maintained by Borrower covering the Properties shall constitute an approved
blanket or umbrella Policy pursuant to terms hereof. Amounts deposited with
Lender in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall be held by Lender in
accordance with the terms of Section 7.7 hereof.

         Section 7.3     Replacements and Replacement Reserve.
                         ------------------------------------

         7.3.1 Replacement Reserve Fund. With respect to each Individual
               ------------------------
Property, Borrower shall pay to Lender on the first Payment Date of each
calendar quarter the Replacement Reserve Deposit for replacements and repairs
required to be made to the Properties during the calendar year (collectively,
the "Replacements"). Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as
Borrower's "Replacement Reserve Fund" and the account in which such amounts are
held shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "Replacement Reserve
Account". In the event an Individual Property is released from the Lien of its
related Security Instrument in accordance with Section 2.4 or 2.6 hereof, any
amount held in the Replacement Reserve Account and allocated for such Individual
Property shall be retained by Lender and credited toward the future Replacement
Reserves Quarterly Deposits required by Lender hereunder for the Individual
Properties remaining subject to the Lien of the Security Instruments. Borrower
covenants and agrees to provide Lender evidence, reasonably acceptable to
Lender, within thirty (30) days of the start of each calendar quarter, of the
Actual Amount for the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of depositing the Replacement Reserve
Deposit, Borrower may deliver to Lender one (1) or more Letters of Credit each
in the amount of the required Replacement Reserve Deposit.

         7.3.2 Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account. (a) Provided that
               ----------------------------------------------
(i) the Replacement Reserve contains cash and (ii) no Triggering Event shall
have occurred and be continuing, Lender shall make disbursements from the
Replacement Reserve Account to pay or reimburse Borrower only for the costs of
the Replacements. Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements from the
Replacement Reserve Account to pay or reimburse Borrower for the costs of
routine maintenance to an Individual Property, for replacement of inventory or
for costs which are to be reimbursed from the Required Repair Fund.

         (b)    Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower and
satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2, disburse to
Borrower amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account necessary to pay or
reimburse Borrower for the actual approved costs and Replacements upon
completion of such Replacements (or, upon partial completion in the case of
Replacements made pursuant to Section 7.3.2(e)) as reasonably determined by
Lender. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the
Replacement Reserve Account if a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

         (c)    Each request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve
Account shall be in a form reasonably specified or approved by Lender and shall
specify (i) the specific Replacements for which the disbursement is requested,
(ii) the quantity and price of each item purchased or to be purchased, if the
Replacement includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (iii) the
price of all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Replacement
other than the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (iv) the cost of
all contracted labor or other services applicable to each Replacement for which
the disbursement is requested. With each request Borrower shall deliver an
Officer's Certificate certifying that all Replacements subject to prior
requests, have been made in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements of
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the applicable Individual
Property to which the Replacements are being provided. Each request for
disbursement shall include copies of invoices for all items or materials
purchased or to be purchased and all contracted labor or services provided or to
be provided and each request shall include waivers of lien and evidence of
payment from each contractor, as applicable, previously receiving payment out of
any prior such request. Except as provided in Section 7.3.2(e), each request for
disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account shall be made only after
completion of the Replacement for which disbursement is requested. Borrower
shall provide Lender evidence of completion or partial completion, as
applicable, satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable judgment.

         (d)    Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with the
Replacements with respect to each request for disbursement (i) prior to
submitting such request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account,
(ii) with the funds received from the applicable disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account or, (iii) at the request of Borrower, Lender will
issue joint checks, payable to Borrower and the contractor, supplier,
materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or other party to whom payment is due in
connection with a Replacement. In the case of payments made by joint check,
Lender may require a waiver of lien from each Person receiving payment prior to
Lender's disbursement

                                    - 71 -

from the Replacement Reserve Account. In addition, as a condition to any
disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives
payment in an amount equal to or greater than $50,000 for completion of its work
or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall conform
to the requirements of applicable law and shall cover all work performed and
materials supplied (including equipment and fixtures) for the applicable
Individual Property by that contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or
materialman through the date covered by the current payment or reimbursement
request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor, supplier,
subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check, the
release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

         (e) If (i) the cost of a Replacement exceeds $50,000, (ii) the
contractor performing such Replacement requires periodic payments pursuant to
terms of a written contract, and (iii) Lender has approved in writing in advance
such periodic payments, a request for payment or reimbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account may be made after completion of a portion of the
work under such contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon
completion of such portion of the work, (B) the materials for which the request
is made are on site at the applicable Individual Property and are properly
secured or have been installed in such Individual Property (or if stored at a
place other than the applicable Individual Property, are secured in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Lender), (C) all other conditions in this Agreement for
disbursement have been satisfied, (D) funds remaining in the Replacement Reserve
Account together with other funds or assurances reasonably satisfactory to
Lender deposited with Lender and available for such Replacements are, in
Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to complete such Replacement and other
Replacements when required, and (E) if required by Lender, each contractor or
subcontractor receiving payments under such contract shall provide a waiver of
lien with respect to amounts which have been paid to that contractor or
subcontractor.

         (f) Borrower shall not make a request for disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account more frequently than once in any calendar month and
(except in connection with the final disbursement) the total cost of all
Replacements in any request shall not be less than $25,000.00.

         7.3.3 Performance of Replacements. (a) Borrower shall make Replacements
               ---------------------------
when required in order to keep each Individual Property in condition and repair
consistent with other first class, full service hotels in the same market
segment in the metropolitan area in which the respective Individual Property is
located, and to keep each Individual Property or any portion thereof from
deteriorating. Borrower shall complete all Replacements in a good and
workmanlike manner as soon as practicable following the commencement of making
each such Replacement.

         (b) In connection with Replacements for which payments or
reimbursements are requested from the Replacement Reserve Account, Lender
reserves the right, at its option, to approve each contract or work order with
materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors or other parties
providing labor or materials in connection with the Replacements in the event
amounts payable under such contract or work order exceed $100,000. Upon Lender's
request, Borrower shall assign such contract or subcontract to Lender.

         (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender shall have the option to withhold disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account for any unsatisfactory Replacement and to proceed
under existing contracts or to contract with third parties to complete such
Replacement and to apply the Replacement Reserve Fund toward the labor and
materials necessary to complete such Replacement, without providing any prior
notice to Borrower and to exercise any and all other remedies available to
Lender upon an Event of Default hereunder.

         (d) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making of the
Replacements pursuant to Section 7.3.3(c) above, Borrower grants Lender the
right to enter onto any Individual Property upon prior written notice to
Borrower and subject to the rights of tenants and hotel guests and perform any
and all work and labor necessary to complete or make the Replacements and/or
employ watchmen to protect such Individual Property from damage. All sums so
expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Replacement Reserve Fund, shall
be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and secured by the
Security Instruments. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete
or undertake the

                                    - 72 -
<PAGE>

Replacements in the name of Borrower. Such power of attorney shall be deemed to
be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked, provided, however,
Lender shall not exercise such power of attorney until the earlier of (i) the
occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or (ii) ten (10) days after
Lender notifies Borrower of its intention to exercise such power of attorney.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any funds in the
Replacement Reserve Account for the purpose of making or completing the
Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes and corrections to the
Replacements as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable to complete the
Replacements; (iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects and inspectors as shall be reasonably required for such purposes;
(iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may
become Liens against any Individual Property, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v)
to execute all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may
be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend all
actions or proceedings in connection with any Individual Property or the
rehabilitation and repair of any Individual Property; and (vii) to do any and
every act which Borrower might do in its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
Agreement.

         (e) Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing the Replacements; (ii) require Lender to expend funds
in addition to the Replacement Reserve Fund to make or complete any Replacement;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Replacements; or (iv) obligate Lender
to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement.

         (f) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties making Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3
to enter onto each Individual Property during normal business hours and upon
prior written notice (subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to
inspect the progress of any Replacements and all materials being used in
connection therewith, to examine all plans and shop drawings relating to such
Replacements which are or may be kept at each Individual Property, and to
complete any Replacements made pursuant to this Section 7.3.3. Borrower shall
cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or Lender's
representatives or such other persons described above in connection with
inspections described in this Section 7.3.3(f) or the completion of Replacements
pursuant to this Section 7.3.3.

         (g) Lender may require an inspection of an Individual Property at
Borrower's expense prior to making a monthly disbursement in excess of $100,000
from the Replacement Reserve Account in order to verify completion of the
Replacements for which payment or reimbursement is sought. Lender may require
that such inspection be conducted by an appropriate independent qualified
professional selected by Lender and/or may require a copy of a certificate of
completion by an independent qualified professional acceptable to Lender prior
to the disbursement of any amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account.
Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder, whether
such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional.

         (h) The Replacements and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any
other item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be constructed, installed
or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialmen's or
other liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (i) Before each disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account in
excess of $100,000.00, Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender with a
search of title to the applicable Individual Property effective to the date of
the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's or materialmen's liens
or other liens of any nature (other than Liens being contested in good faith in
accordance with the terms hereof) have been placed against the applicable
Individual Property since the date of recordation of the related Security
Instrument and that title to such Individual Property is free and clear of all
Liens (other than the lien of the related Security Instrument and any other
Liens previously approved in writing by Lender, if any, or Permitted
Encumbrances).

         (j) All Replacements shall comply with all applicable Legal
Requirements of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the
applicable Individual Property and applicable insurance requirements including,
without limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits,
environmental regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

                                    - 73 -
<PAGE>

         (k) In addition to any insurance required under the Loan Documents,
Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided workmen's compensation insurance,
builder's risk, and public liability insurance and other insurance to the extent
required under applicable law in connection with a particular Replacement to the
extent not already provided by Borrower's existing insurance coverage. All such
policies shall be in form and amount reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All such
policies which can be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss
payable to Lender or its assigns shall be so endorsed. Certified copies of such
policies shall be delivered to Lender.

         7.3.4 Failure to Make Replacements. (a) It shall be an Event of Default
               ----------------------------
under this Agreement if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this
Section 7.3 and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice
from Lender. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of such an Event of
Default, Lender may use the Replacement Reserve Fund (or any portion thereof)
for any purpose, including but not limited to completion of the Replacements as
provided in Sections 7.3.3(c) and (d), or for any other repair or replacement to
any Individual Property or toward payment of the Debt in such order, proportion
and priority as Lender may determine in its sole discretion. Lender's right to
withdraw and apply the Replacement Reserve Funds shall be in addition to all
other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

         (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any
portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on account of an Event of Default to
payment of the Debt or in any specific order or priority.

         7.3.5 Balance in the Replacement Reserve Account. The insufficiency of
               ------------------------------------------
any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account shall not relieve Borrower from
its obligation to fulfill all preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan
Documents.

         Section 7.4      Intentionally Omitted.
                          ---------------------

         Section 7.5      Intentionally Omitted.
                          ---------------------

         Section 7.6      Ground Lease Escrow Fund.
                          ------------------------

             Borrower shall pay to Lender, together with the scheduled payment
of interest under the Loan each month, an amount (the "Monthly Ground Rent
Deposit") that is estimated by Lender to be due and payable by Borrower under
the Ground Lease for all rent and any and all other charges (the "Ground Rent")
which may be due by Borrower under the Ground Lease in order to accumulate with
Lender sufficient funds to pay all sums payable under the Ground Lease at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the dates due (said amounts, hereinafter called
the "Ground Lease Escrow Fund"). The Ground Lease Escrow Fund is for the purpose
of paying all sums due under the Ground Lease. Upon Borrower's failure to pay
any rent or other charges due under the Ground Lease after the receipt of any
notice and the expiration of any cure period available to Borrower pursuant to
the Ground Lease, Lender may, in its discretion, apply any amounts held in the
Ground Lease Escrow Fund to the payment of such rent or other charges; provided
however, that the provisions of this Section 7.6 shall not be deemed to create
any obligation on the part of Lender to pay any such rent or other charges from
amounts on deposit in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in lieu of depositing the Monthly Ground Rent Deposit, Borrower shall
have the option of delivering to Lender a Letter of Credit equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the annual Ground Rent due under the Ground Lease, as
calculated each year during the term of the Loan. Such deposit may be increased
by Lender in the amount Lender deems is necessary in its reasonable discretion
based on any increases in the rent due under the Ground Lease.

         Section 7.7     Reserve Funds, Generally.
                         ------------------------

         7.7.1 Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in each of the Reserve Funds and the related Accounts and any and all
monies now or hereafter deposited in each Reserve Fund and related Account as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Funds and the related Accounts shall constitute
additional security for the Debt.

<PAGE>

         7.7.2 Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender may, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
available to Lender, apply any sums then present in any or all of the Reserve
Funds to the payment of the Debt in any order in its sole discretion.

         7.7.3 The Reserve Funds shall not constitute trust funds, shall be held
in a segregated account and shall be held at the Lockbox Bank.

         7.7.4 The Reserve Funds shall be held in interest bearing accounts and
all earnings or interest on a Reserve Fund shall be added to and become a part
of such Reserve Fund and shall be disbursed in the same manner as other monies
deposited in such Reserve Fund.

         7.7.5 Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent
of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any Reserve
Fund or related Account or the monies deposited therein or permit any lien or
encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1
Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be
filed with respect thereto.

         7.7.6 Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from and
against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, actual
direct damages, obligations and costs and expenses (including litigation costs
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected
with the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts or the performance of the
obligations for which the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts were
established, except to the extent caused by Lender's or its agent's or
employee's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Borrower shall assign to
Lender all rights and claims Borrower may have against all persons or entities
supplying labor, materials or other services which are to be paid from or
secured by the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts; provided, however, that
Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event of Default has
occurred and remains uncured.

          or terminates such business for any reason whatsoever (other than
          temporary cessation in connection with Force Majeure or any
          renovations to the Property or restoration of the Property after
          Casualty or Condemnation);

               (xxvi)  if any Borrower operates the Property under the name of
          any hotel chain or system other than Wyndham, or the name of the hotel
          chain or system of a public or private entity into which Wyndham
          merged or consolidated or by which Wyndham is acquired in a transfer
          permitted under Section 5.2.12 hereof, without Lender's prior written
          consent; or

               (xxvii) if any Borrower shall continue to be in Default under any
          of the other terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement not
          specified in subsections (i) to (xxvi) above, for ten (10) days after
          notice

                                    - 77 -
<PAGE>

          to Borrower from Lender, in the case of any Default which can be cured
          by the payment of a sum of money, or for thirty (30) days after notice
          from Lender in the case of any other Default; provided, however, that
          if such non-monetary Default is susceptible of cure but cannot
          reasonably be cured within such 30-day period and provided further
          that Borrower shall have commenced to cure such Default within such
          30-day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to
          cure the same, such 30-day period shall be extended for such time as
          is reasonably necessary for Borrower in the exercise of due diligence
          to cure such Default, such additional period not to exceed ninety (90)
          days; or

               (xxviii) if there shall be default under any of the other Loan
          Documents beyond any applicable cure periods contained in such
          documents, whether as to any Borrower or any Individual Property, or
          if any other such event shall occur or condition shall exist, if the
          effect of such event or condition is to accelerate the maturity of any
          portion of the Debt or to permit Lender to accelerate the maturity of
          all or any portion of the Debt;

          (b)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default (other than an Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or
(viii) above) and at any time thereafter, in addition to any other rights or
remedies available to it pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
or at law or in equity, Lender may take such action, without notice or demand,
that Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower
and in and to all or any Individual Property, including, without limitation,
declaring the Debt to be immediately due and payable, and Lender may enforce or
avail itself of any or all rights or remedies provided in the Loan Documents
against Borrower and any or all of the Properties, including, without
limitation, all rights or remedies available at law or in equity; and upon any
Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the Debt and
all other obligations of Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, without notice or
demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything
contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

          Section 8.2 Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the
                      --------
continuance of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights,
powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrower under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or
applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any
time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be
declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any
foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and
remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to all or any Individual
Property or any other Collateral. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be
cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly,
successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender
may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender
permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees
that if an Event of Default is continuing, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, (i) Lender is not subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law
or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to
Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of
its remedies against the Properties and the other Collateral and each Security
Instrument has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

          (b)  With respect to Borrower and the Properties, nothing contained
herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to
resort to any Individual Property or Collateral for the satisfaction of any of
the Debt in preference or priority to any other Individual Property or
Collateral, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of all of the Properties or all
of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of
the Debt. In addition, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Lender shall
have the right from time to time to partially foreclose the Security Instruments
in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Security Instruments then due
and payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion including, without
limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event Borrower defaults
beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled
payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose one or more of the
Security Instruments to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event
Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal

                                    - 78 -
<PAGE>

balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Security
Instruments to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender
may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or more of the Security
Instruments as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial
foreclosures, the Properties shall remain subject to the Security Instruments to
secure payment of sums secured by the Security Instruments and not previously
recovered.

          Section 8.3     Remedies Cumulative; Waivers. The rights, powers and
                          ----------------------------
remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any other right, power or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower pursuant
to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity
or otherwise. Lender's rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly,
concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may
determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any
remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such
remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such
remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be
deemed expedient. A waiver of one or more Defaults or Events of Default with
respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent
Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power
consequent thereon.

          IX.   SPECIAL PROVISIONS
                ------------------

          Section 9.1     Sale of Notes and Securitization.
                          --------------------------------

                  Lender may, at any time, sell, transfer or assign the Note,
this Agreement, the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents, and any
or all servicing rights with respect thereto, or grant participations therein or
issue mortgage pass-through certificates or other securities (the "Securities")
evidencing a beneficial interest in a rated or unrated public offering or
private placement (a "Securitization"). At the request of the holder of the Note
and, to the extent not already required to be provided by Borrower under this
Agreement, Borrower shall, at Borrower's expense (subject to the limitations set
forth below), use reasonable efforts to satisfy the market standards to which
the holder of the Note customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required
in the marketplace or by the Rating Agencies in connection with a Securitization
or the sale of the Note or the participations or Securities, including, without
limitation, to:

                  (a)     (i)  provide such financial and other information with
                          respect to the Properties, Borrower and the Manager,
                          (ii) provide budgets relating to the Properties and
                          (iii) to perform or permit or cause to be performed or
                          permitted, at Lender's expense, such site inspection,
                          appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews and
                          reports (Phase I's and, if appropriate, Phase II's),
                          engineering reports and other due diligence
                          investigations of the Properties, as may be reasonably
                          requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating
                          Agencies or as may be necessary or appropriate in
                          connection with the Securitization (the "Provided
                          Information"), provided, however Phase II reports and
                          other invasive testing may not be performed at any
                          Individual Property unless Borrower has received
                          evidence of insurance for any Person performing such
                          testing, together, if customary, with appropriate
                          verification and/or consents of the Provided
                          Information through letters of auditors or opinions of
                          counsel of independent attorneys acceptable to Lender
                          and the Rating Agencies;

                  (b)     if required by the Rating Agencies, deliver (i)
                          revised opinions of counsel as to non-consolidation,
                          due execution and enforceability with respect to the
                          Properties, Borrower, Guarantor, Indemnitor, Principal
                          and their respective Affiliates and the Loan
                          Documents, and (ii) revised organizational documents
                          as they relate to the single purpose bankruptcy
                          remoteness of Borrower and/or Principal, (provided,
                          however, no such revisions to Borrower's or
                          Principal's organizational documents shall have a
                          material adverse effect on Borrower and/or Principal,
                          as applicable) which counsel, opinions and
                          organizational documents shall be shall be
                          satisfactory to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

                  (c)     if required by the Rating Agencies, deliver such
                          additional tenant estoppel letters, subordination
                          agreements or other agreements from parties to
                          agreements that affect the

<PAGE>

                  Properties, which estoppel letters, subordination agreements
                  or other agreements shall be satisfactory to Lender and the
                  Rating Agencies.

             (d)  execute such amendments to the Loan Documents and
                  organizational documents, as may be requested by the holder of
                  the Note or the Rating Agencies or otherwise to effect the
                  Securitization; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
                  required to modify or amend any organizational document or
                  Loan Document if such modification or amendment would (except
                  for modifications and amendments required to be made pursuant
                  to Section (e) below,) (i) change the interest rate, the
                  stated maturity or the amortization of principal set forth in
                  the Note, or (ii) modify or amend any other material economic
                  or material non-economic term of the organizational documents
                  or Loan Documents.

             (e)  if Lender elects, in its sole discretion, prior to or upon a
                  Securitization, to split the Loan into two or more parts, or
                  the Note into multiple component notes or tranches which may
                  have different interest rates, amortization payments,
                  principal amounts and maturities, Borrower agrees to cooperate
                  with Lender in connection with the foregoing and to execute
                  the required modifications and amendments to the Note, this
                  Agreement and the Loan Documents and to provide opinions
                  necessary to effectuate the same; provided, however Borrower
                  shall not be required to modify or amend any Loan Documents if
                  (i) the initial weighted average interest rate of such split
                  notes would be greater than the Applicable Interest Rate
                  immediately preceding such loan split or (ii) such
                  modification or amendment would (a) change the Maturity Date
                  or Monthly Scheduled Amortization Payment or (b) modify or
                  amend any other material economic or material non-economic
                  term of the Loan Documents, provided, that, notwithstanding
                  the provisions below, Borrower shall not be responsible for
                  the payment of any title insurance premiums required by Lender
                  in connection with the foregoing, but Borrower shall be
                  responsible for all other cost and expenses (subject to the
                  limitations set forth below) in complying with this Section
                  9.1(e).

             (f)  make such representations and warranties as of the closing
                  date of the Securitization with respect to the Properties,
                  Borrower, and the Loan Documents as are customarily provided
                  in securitization transactions and as may be reasonably
                  requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies and
                  consistent with the facts covered by such representations and
                  warranties as they exist on the date thereof, including the
                  representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents; and

             (g)  supply to Lender such documentation, financial statements and
                  reports in form and substance required for Lender to comply
                  with Regulation S-X of the federal securities law.


             All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
connection with Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 9.1
shall be paid by Borrower; provided, however, other than with respect to (i)
items which Borrower, Principal, Wyndham and/or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing are otherwise required to deliver pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents, (ii) the cost of agreed upon procedures and the cost of a wind storm
analysis, if required by Lender and (iii) legal counsel employed by Borrower,
Principal, Wyndham and/or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, such costs and
expenses shall not exceed $20,000.00 in the aggregate.

    Section 9.2   Securitization Indemnification.
                  ------------------------------

    (a)      Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information may
be included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus supplement or private
placement memorandum (each, a "Disclosure Document") and may also be included in
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or provided or made available to
investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and
service providers relating to the Securitization.

                                    - 80 -
<PAGE>

In the event that the Disclosure Document is required to be revised prior to the
sale of all Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the holder of the Note in
updating the Disclosure Document by providing all current information necessary
to keep the Disclosure Document accurate and complete in all material respects.

         (b) Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final private placement memorandum or (ii) a preliminary and
final prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable (collectively, the
"Offering Materials"), an indemnification certificate (A) certifying that
Borrower has carefully examined such memorandum or prospectus, as applicable,
including without limitation, the sections entitled "Special Considerations,"
"Description of the Mortgages," "Description of the Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged
Property," "The Manager," "The Borrower" and "Certain Legal Aspects of the
Mortgage Loan," and such sections (and any other sections reasonably requested
to the extent the same relate to the Loan, the Loan Documents, Borrower,
Guarantor, Indemnitor, Principal or an Affiliate of any of the foregoing) do not
(and with respect to any portion of the Offering Materials prepared in reliance
on the reports of third-parties, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, do not)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (B) indemnifying
Lender (and for purposes of this Section 9.2, Lender hereunder shall include its
officers and directors), the Affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman") that
has filed the registration statement, if any, relating to the securitization
(the "Registration Statement"), each of its directors, each of its officers who
have signed the Registration Statement and each Person or entity who controls
the Affiliate within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Lehman Group"), and Lehman, each of
its directors and each Person who controls Lehman within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Underwriter Group") for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, the "Liabilities") to which Lender, the Lehman Group or the
Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material
fact contained in such sections (other than such statement or misstatement made
in Borrower's good faith reliance upon the reports of third parties that do not
to the best of Borrower's knowledge, contain any untrue statement or
misstatement or a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading) or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact required to be stated in such sections or necessary in order to
make the statements in such sections or in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and (C) agreeing to reimburse Lender, the
Lehman Group and the Underwriter Group for any legal or other out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Lehman in connection with
investigating or defending the Liabilities; provided, however, that Borrower
will be liable in any such case under clauses (B) or (C) above only to the
extent that any such loss claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based
upon any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower in
connection with the preparation of the memorandum or prospectus or in connection
with the underwriting of the debt, including, without limitation, financial
statements of Borrower, operating statements, rent rolls, environmental site
assessment reports and property condition reports with respect to the Property
but excluding any projections made in good faith by Borrower; and provided that
this Section 9.2 shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage or liability to the
extent arising out of any untrue statement, misstatement or omission or alleged
untrue statement, misstatement or omission made in reliance upon and in
connection with written information furnished to Borrower by Lender, any member
of the Lehman Group or any member of the Underwriter Group expressly for use in
the Offering Materials unless Borrower, Principal or Indemnitor fails to correct
any such untrue statement, misstatement or omission with respect to Borrower,
Principal or Indemnitor that is known to Borrower, Principal or Indemnitor or
that, with the exercise of customary reasonable efforts, should be known to
Borrower, Principal or Indemnitor. The foregoing indemnity with respect to any
untrue statement or misstatement contained in, or omission from, preliminary
Offering Materials shall not inure to the benefit of any member of the Lehman
Group or the Underwriting Group (or any person controlling such Lehman Group or
Underwriting Group) from whom the Person asserting any such loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense purchased any of the securities which are the subject
thereof if Borrower shall sustain the burden of proving that any such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such Person was
not provided with a copy of the final Offering Materials at or prior to the
written confirmation of the sale of such securities to such Person and the loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from an untrue statement or
misstatement contained in, or omission from, the preliminary Offering Materials
that was corrected in the final Offering Materials. This indemnity agreement
will be in addition to any liability which Borrower

                                      -81-
<PAGE>

may otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification provided for in Clauses (B)
and (C) above shall be effective whether or not an indemnification certificate
described in (A) above is provided and shall be applicable based on information
previously provided by Borrower or its Affiliates if Borrower does not provide
the indemnification certificate.

         (c) In connection with filings under the Exchange Act, Borrower agrees
to indemnify (i) Lender, the Lehman Group and the Underwriter Group for
Liabilities to which Lender, the Lehman Group or the Underwriter Group may
become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state in the Provided Information a material
fact required to be stated in the Provided Information in order to make the
statements in the Provided Information, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made not misleading (other than any such statement, misstatement
or omission made in reliance upon the reports of third parties that do not, to
the best of Borrower's knowledge, contain any untrue statement or misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading) and (ii) reimburse Lender, the Lehman Group or the Underwriter
Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender, the Lehman
Group or the Underwriter Group in connection with defending or investigating the
Liabilities. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply with respect to any
Liabilities that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement,
misstatement or omission or any alleged untrue statement, misstatement or
omission to state in the Provided Information a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading, if such
untrue statement, misstatement or omission or alleged untrue statement,
misstatement or omission related to statements or information that do not
accurately reflect Provided Information or any corrections or updates to
Provided Information which were provided prior to the delivery of the final
Offering Materials to investors and neither Borrower, Principal nor Indemnitor
has been given reasonable opportunity to review the proposed filing under the
Exchange Act and to correct such untrue statement, misstatement or omission. In
no event shall the indemnification, contribution or reimbursement obligations of
Borrower under this Section 9.2 apply to any filings made under the Exchange Act
after the initial filings, if any, are made.

         (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section
9.2 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under
this Section 9.2, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with
any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
(or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.
After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this
Section 9.2 the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided,
however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other
indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party to
parties. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person
unless: (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by Borrower
in writing; or (ii) in such claims or action there is, in the reasonable opinion
of independent counsel, a conflict concerning any material issue between the
position of Borrower and such Indemnified Person, in which case if such
Indemnified Person notifies Borrower in writing that it elects to employ
separate counsel at the expense of Borrower, then such counsel shall have the
right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Person;
provided, however, that unless, in the reasonable opinion of independent
counsel, an actual or potential conflict exists between two or more Indemnified
Persons, Borrower shall not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Persons.

Nothing set forth herein is intended to or shall impair the right of any
Indemnified Person to retain separate counsel at its own expense.

         (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 9.2(b)
or (c) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party
in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under
Section 9.2(b) or (c), the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof); provided, however, that
no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the
amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the
following factors shall be considered: (i) Lehman's and Borrower's relative
knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which
claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or
omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
circumstances. Lender and Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable
if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita
allocation.

         (f) The liabilities and obligations of both Borrower and Lender under
this Section 9.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

         Section 9.3       Servicer.
                           --------

             At the option of Lender, the Loan may be serviced by a
servicer/trustee (the "Servicer") selected by Lender and Lender may delegate all
or any portion of its responsibilities under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to the Servicer pursuant to a servicing agreement (the "Servicing
Agreement") between Lender and Servicer.

         Section 9.4       Exculpation. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein,
                           -----------
Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and
observe the representations, warranties and obligations contained in the Note,
this Agreement, the Security Instruments or the other Loan Documents by any
action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower,
except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action for specific
performance or other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to
enforce and realize upon its interest in the Note, this Agreement, the Security
Instruments, the other Loan Documents, and the interest in the Properties, the
Rents, the Collateral and any other collateral given to Lender pursuant to the
Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments or the other Loan Documents;
provided, however, that any judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of Borrower's interest in the
Properties, in the Rent, the Collateral and in any other collateral given to
Lender. In no event shall any Related Party have any personal liability for the
payment of the indebtedness or any other sum due hereunder, under the Note, the
Security Instruments or the other Loan Documents, or for the performance or
observance of any other obligation of Borrower other than pursuant to a written
instrument executed by such Related Party specifically providing for such
liability. Lender, by accepting the Note, this Agreement and the Security
Instruments, agrees that it shall not, except as otherwise provided herein sue
for, seek or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower and/or any Related
Party in any such action or proceeding, under or by reason of or under or in
connection with the Note, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the
Security Instruments. The provisions of this Section shall not, however, (i)
constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or
secured by the Note, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Security
Instruments; (ii) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower as a party
defendant in any action or suit for judicial foreclosure and sale under the
Security Instruments; (iii) affect the validity or enforceability of any
indemnity (including, without limitation, the Environmental Indemnity and the
Maryland Guaranty), guaranty, master lease or similar instrument made in
connection with the Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments, or the other
Loan Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a
receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the Assignment of Leases; (vi) impair
the right of Lender to enforce the provisions of Sections 4.1.8, 4.1.28, 5.1.9
and 5.2.8 of this Agreement; or (vii) impair the right of Lender to obtain a
deficiency judgment or other judgment on the Note against Borrower if necessary
to preserve or enforce its rights and remedies against any Collateral, including
any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards to which Lender would otherwise be
entitled under this Agreement or the

                                      -83-
<PAGE>

Security Instruments; provided however, Lender shall only enforce such judgment
against such Collateral, including the insurance proceeds and/or condemnation
awards, as applicable.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.4 to the contrary,
Borrower shall be personally liable to Lender for the direct, actual Losses it
incurs due to: (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by any Borrower or any
other person or entity in connection with the execution and the delivery of the
Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments or the other Loan Documents; (ii)
any Borrower's intentional misapplication or misappropriation of Rents received
by Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default; (iii) any Borrower's
intentional misapplication or misappropriation of tenant security deposits or
Rents collected more than one (1) month in advance; (iv) the intentional
misapplication or the misappropriation of Insurance Proceeds or Awards; (v) any
Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges, Ground Rent, charges for labor
or materials or other charges that can create liens on any of the Properties
(except to the extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have been
deposited in the Lockbox Account or are otherwise in escrow with Lender pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement) but only to the extent that the Properties Net
Operating Income available to Borrower was sufficient to permit Borrower to pay
the same when due; (vi) any Borrower's failure to return or to reimburse Lender
for all Personal Property taken from any of the Properties by or on behalf of
Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default and in violation of the
terms of this Agreement and the Security Instruments and not replaced with
Personal Property of the same utility and of the same or greater value; (vii)
any act of actual intentional waste or arson by any Borrower, any principal,
affiliate or general partner thereof or by any Indemnitor or Guarantor which is
not attributable to a lack of sufficient Net Operating Income available to
Borrower from the Properties to perform all of Borrower's or such affiliate's
obligations under the Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments or the
other Loan Documents; (viii) any fees or commissions paid by any Borrower to any
principal, affiliate or general partner of Borrower, Indemnitor or Guarantor in
violation of the terms of the Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments or
the other Loan Documents; (ix) any Borrower's failure to comply with the
provisions of Sections 4.1.39 and 5.1.19 hereof; or (x) if any Individual
Property or any part thereof shall become an asset in an involuntary bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding commenced by any Person (other than Lender) and
Borrower fails to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a dismissal
of such proceedings.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to
pursue recourse liability as set forth in Subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL
AND VOID and shall be of no further force and effect as to Borrower (but not to
any Related Party other than pursuant to a written instrument executed by such
Related Party specifically providing for such liability) (i) in the event of any
Borrower's wilful default to provide a report or information under Section
5.1.10(b), (c), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l), but a failure to provide such
reports and information shall not be deemed willful if such failure is the
result of good faith error and is cured within ten (10) Business Days after
notice is delivered to Borrower, provided, however, that if (x) Borrower is
prevented by an unaffiliated third party from delivering such information, and
(y) Borrower uses reasonable efforts (including the reasonable expenditure of
money) to obtain such information, then such failure shall not be deemed willful
so long as Borrower continuously endeavors in good faith to obtain the required
financial reports and information and delivers same to Lender as soon as it
becomes available to Borrower, (ii) in the event of a default under Section
4.1.35 of this Agreement such that either (A) such failure was considered by a
court as a factor in the court's finding for a consolidation of the assets of
Borrower with the assets of another person or entity or (B) as a result thereof,
Lender suffers any material damage, cost, liability, or expense (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, whether or not litigation has
commenced); provided, however, that in the absence of an actual consolidation,
recourse may be had against Borrower only to the extent of Losses for its
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 4.1.35 or, (iii) in the event
of a default under Section 5.2.12 of this Agreement; (iv) if any Individual
Property or any part thereof shall become an asset in a voluntary bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding or (v) if the first full Monthly Debt Service Payment
Amount is not paid when due.

         (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which
Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of
the Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the indebtedness
secured by the Security Instruments or to require that all collateral shall
continue to secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with
the Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents.

         Section 9.5       Contributions and Waivers.
                           -------------------------

         (a) As a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each Borrower will benefit, directly and indirectly, from each Borrower's
obligation to pay the Debt and perform its obligations under the Note, this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (the "Obligations") and in consideration
therefor desire to enter into an allocation and contribution agreement among
themselves as set forth in this Section 9.5 to allocate such benefits among
themselves and to provide a fair and equitable agreement to make contributions
among each of the Borrowers in the event any payment is made by any individual
Borrower hereunder to the Lender (such payment being referred to herein as a
"Contribution," and for purposes of this Section 9.5, includes any exercise of
recourse by the Lender against any Collateral of a Borrower and application of
proceeds of such Collateral in satisfaction of such Borrower's obligations, to
the Lender under the Loan Documents).

         (b) Each Borrower shall be liable hereunder with respect to the
Obligations only for such total maximum amount (if any) that would not render
its Obligations hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents subject to
avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions
of any State law.

         (c) In order to provide for a fair and equitable contribution among the
Borrowers in the event that any Contribution is made by an individual Borrower
(a "Funding Borrower"), such Funding Borrower shall be entitled to a
reimbursement Contribution ("Reimbursement Contribution") from all other
Borrowers for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding
Borrower in discharging any of the Obligations, in the manner and to the extent
set forth in this Section 9.5. The amount of any Reimbursement Contribution
hereunder shall be equal to the payment made by the Funding Borrower to the
Lender or any other beneficiary pursuant to this Agreement and shall be
determined as of the date on which such payment is made.

         (d) For purposes hereof, the "Benefit Amount" of any individual
Borrower as of any date of determination shall be the net value of the benefits
to such Borrower and its affiliates from extensions of credit made by the Lender
to (a) such Borrower and (b) to the other Borrowers hereunder and the Loan
Documents to the extent such other Borrowers have guaranteed or mortgaged their
Properties to secure the Obligations of such Borrower to the Lender.

         (e) Each Borrower shall be liable to a Funding Borrower in an amount
equal to the greater of (A) the (i) ratio of the Benefit Amount of such Borrower
to the total amount of Obligations, multiplied by (ii) the amount of Obligations
paid by such Funding Borrower, or (B) 95% of the excess of the fair saleable
value of the property of such Borrower over the total liabilities of such
Borrower (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in
respect of contingent liabilities) determined as of the date on which the
payment made by a Funding Borrower is deemed made for purposes hereof (giving
effect to all payments made by other Funding Borrowers as of such date in a
manner to maximize the amount of such Contributions).

         (f) In the event that at any time there exists more than one Funding
Borrower with respect to any Contribution (in any such case, the "Applicable
Contribution"), then Reimbursement Contributions from other Borrowers pursuant
hereto shall be allocated among such Funding Borrowers in proportion to the
total amount of the Contribution made for or on account of the other Borrowers
by each such Funding Borrower pursuant to the Applicable Contribution. In the
event that at any time any Borrower pays an amount hereunder in excess of the
amount calculated pursuant to this Section 9.5 above, that Borrower shall be
deemed to be a Funding Borrower to the extent of such excess and shall be
entitled to a Reimbursement Contribution from the other Borrowers in accordance
with the provisions of this Section.

         (g) The Borrowers acknowledge that the right to Reimbursement
Contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the Borrower to
which such Reimbursement Contribution is owing.

         (h) No Reimbursement Contribution payments payable by a Borrower
pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.5 shall be paid until all amounts then
due and payable by all of the Borrowers to the Lender, pursuant to the

                                      -85-
<PAGE>

terms of the Loan Documents, are paid in full in cash. Nothing contained in this
Section 9.5 shall limit or affect in any way the Obligations of any Borrower to
Lender under this Note or any other Loan Documents.

         (i)      Each Borrower waives:

                  (1)  any right to require Lender to proceed against any other
         Borrower or any other person or to proceed against or exhaust any
         security held by Lender at any time or to pursue any other remedy in
         Lender's power before proceeding against Borrower;

                  (2)  the defense of the statute of limitations in any action
         against any other Borrower or for the collection of any indebtedness or
         the performance of any obligation under the Loan;

                  (3)  any defense based upon any legal disability or other
         defense of any other Borrower, any guarantor or any other person or by
         reason of the cessation or limitation of the liability of any other
         Borrower or any guarantor from any cause other than full payment of all
         sums payable under the Note, this Agreement and any of the other Loan
         Documents;

                  (4)  any defense based upon any lack of authority of the
         officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on
         behalf of any other Borrower or any principal of any other Borrower or
         any defect in the formation of any other Borrower or any principal of
         any other Borrower;

                  (5)  any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which
         provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in
         amount nor in any other respects more burdensome than that of a
         principal;

                  (6)  any defense based upon any failure by Lender to obtain
         collateral for the indebtedness or failure by the Lender to perfect a
         lien on any collateral;

                  (7)  presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind;

                  (8)  any defense based upon any failure of Lender to give
         notice of sale or other disposition of any collateral to any other
         Borrower or to any other person or entity or any defect in any notice
         that may be given in connection with any sale or disposition of any
         collateral;

                  (9)  any defense based upon any failure of Lender to comply
         with Applicable Laws in connection with the sale or other disposition
         of any collateral, including, without limitation, any failure of Lender
         to conduct a commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of any
         collateral;

                  (10) any defense based upon any election by Lender, in any
         bankruptcy proceeding, of the application or non-application of Section
         1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code or any successor statute;

                  (11) any defense based upon any use of cash collateral under
         Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code;

                  (12) any defense based upon any agreement or stipulation
         entered into by Lender with respect to the provision of adequate
         protection in any bankruptcy proceeding;

                  (13) any defense based upon any borrowing or any grant of a
         security interest under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code;

                  (14) any defense based upon the avoidance of any security
         interest in favor of Lender for any reason;

                                      -86-
<PAGE>

                  (15) any defense based upon any bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or
         dissolution proceeding, including any discharge of, or bar or stay
         against collecting, all or any of the obligations evidenced by the Note
         or owing under any of the Loan Documents; and

                  (16) any defense or benefit based upon the Borrower's, or any
         other party's, designation of the portion of any obligation secured by
         the applicable Security Instruments to be satisfied by any payment from
         any other Borrower or any such party.

         (j)      Each Borrower waives:

                  (1)  all rights and defenses arising out of an election of
         remedies by Lender even though the election of remedies, such as
         nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Loan or any
         other amounts owing under the Loan Documents, has destroyed the
         Borrower's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other
         Borrower;

                  (2)  all rights and defenses that Borrower may have because
         any of Debt is secured by real property. This means, among other
         things: (A) Lender may collect from Borrower without first foreclosing
         on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any other
         Borrower; (B) If Lender forecloses on any real property collateral
         pledged by any other Borrower, (i) the amount of the Debt may be
         reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the
         foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale
         price, (ii) Lender may collect from Borrower even if any other
         Borrower, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed
         any right Borrower may have to collect from any other Borrower. This is
         an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses
         Borrower may have because any of the Debt is secured by real property;
         and

                  (3)  any claim or other right which Borrower might now have or
         hereafter acquire against any other Borrower or any other person that
         arises from the existence or performance of any obligations under the
         Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments or the other Loan
         Documents, including, without limitation, any of the following: (a) any
         right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or
         indemnification; or (b) any right to participate in any claim or remedy
         of Lender against any other Borrower or any collateral security
         therefor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity
         or under contract, statute or common law.

any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory to Lender, the decision of Lender

                           -------------

         BORROWER HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE
TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE
EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE
AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE.
LENDER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN ANY PROCEEDING
AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER.

purpose.

         Section 10.9      Severability. Wherever possible, each provision of
                           ------------
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited
by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of
such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         Section 10.10     Preferences. Lender shall have the continuing and
                           -----------
exclusive right to apply or reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower
to any portion of the obligations of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower
makes a payment or payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, State or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations
hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue
in full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received
by Lender.

         Section 10.11     Waiver of Notice. Borrower shall not be entitled to
                           ----------------
any notices of any nature whatsoever from Lender except with respect to matters
for which this Agreement or the other Loan Documents specifically and expressly
provide for the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower and except with respect
to matters for which Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements,
permitted to waive the giving of notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the
right to receive any notice from Lender with respect to any matter for which
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents do not specifically and expressly
provide for the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower.

         Section 10.12     Remedies of Borrower. In the event that a claim or
                           --------------------
adjudication is made that Lender or its agents have acted unreasonably or
unreasonably delayed acting in any case where by law or under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, Lender or such agent, as the case may be, has an
obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower agrees that neither Lender
nor its agents shall be liable for any monetary damages, and Borrower's sole
remedies shall be limited to commencing an action seeking injunctive relief or
declaratory judgment. The parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding to
determine whether Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined by an action
seeking declaratory judgment.

         Section 10.13     Expenses; Indemnity. (a) Except as otherwise
                           -------------------
expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, Borrower
covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to reimburse, Lender
upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
incurred by Lender in connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the
costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without
limitation any opinions requested by Lender as to any legal matters arising
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with respect to the
Properties); (ii) Borrower's ongoing performance of and compliance with
Borrower's respective agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the
Closing Date, including, without limitation, confirming compliance with
environmental and insurance requirements; (iii) Lender's ongoing performance and
compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the
Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
administration of any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents or matters
requested by Lender; (v) securing Borrower's compliance with any requests made
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; (vi) the filing and recording fees
and expenses, title insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
providing to Lender all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses
incurred in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor of Lender pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing or preserving any
rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any
action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case against, under or
affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Properties, or
any other security given for the Loan; and (viii) enforcing any obligations of
or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or with respect to the Properties or in connection with any
refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the
payment of any

                                      -90-
<PAGE>

such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of the gross
negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender. Any cost and
expenses due and payable to Lender may be paid from any amounts in the Lockbox
Account.

         (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all direct, actual liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel for Lender in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened,
whether or not Lender shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against Lender in any manner relating to or arising
out of (i) any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however, that Borrower
shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such
Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or
willful misconduct of Lender, its employees or agents. To the extent that the
undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding
sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy,
Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified
Liabilities incurred by Lender.

         (c) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Lender and the Indemnified Parties from
and against any and all losses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA that may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Sections 4.1.8 or 5.2.8
hereof.

         (d) Intentionally Omitted.

         Section 10.14     Schedules and Exhibits Incorporated. The Schedules
                           -----------------------------------
and Exhibits annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part of this
Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

         Section 10.15     Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses. Any assignee of
                           -----------------------------------
Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan
Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets, counterclaims or
defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower may otherwise have
against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated counterclaim or
defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any action or proceeding
brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any such right to interpose
or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action
or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

         Section 10.16     No Joint Venture or Partnership; No Third Party
                           -----------------------------------------------
Beneficiaries. (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
-------------
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and
lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Properties other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

         (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

         Section 10.17     Publicity. All news releases, publicity or
                           ---------
advertising by Borrower or their Affiliates through any media intended to reach
the general public which refers to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced
by the Loan Documents, to Lender, Lehman, or any of their Affiliates shall be
subject to the prior written approval of Lender.

         Section 10.18     Cross-Default; Cross-Collateralization; Waiver of
                           -------------------------------------------------
Marshalling of Assets. (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan
---------------------
to Maker upon the security of its collective interest in the Properties and in
reliance upon the aggregate of the Properties taken together being of greater
value as collateral security than the sum of each Individual Property taken
separately. Borrower agrees that the Security Instruments are and will be
cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event of
Default under any of the Security Instruments shall constitute an Event of
Default under each of the other Security Instruments which secure the Note; (ii)
an Event of Default under the Note or this Agreement shall constitute an Event
of Default under each Security Instrument; (iii) each Security Instrument shall
constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket lien were placed on all
of the Properties as security for the Note; and (iv) such cross-
collateralization shall in no event be deemed to constitute a fraudulent
conveyance.

         (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and
its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of
foreclosure of all or any of the Security Instruments, and agrees not to assert
any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in
inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates
of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the
right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Properties for the
collection of the Debt without any prior or different resort for collection or
of the right of Lender to the payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the
Properties in preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition,
Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of
foreclosure of any or all of the Security Instruments, any equitable right
otherwise available to Borrower which would require the separate sale of the
Properties or require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any Individual
Property or any combination of the Properties before proceeding against any
other Individual Property or combination of Properties; and further in the event
of such foreclosure Borrower does hereby expressly consents to and authorizes,
at the option of Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together
of any combination of the Properties.

         Section 10.19     Waiver of Counterclaim. Borrower hereby waives the
                           ----------------------
right to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any
action or proceeding brought against it by Lender or its agents, but Borrower
does not waive its right to assert any such claim in a separate action, provided
that such separate action does not prevent the application of payments to the
Debt.

         Section 10.20     Conflict; Construction of Documents; Reliance. In the
                           ---------------------------------------------
event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the
other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The
parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent counsel in
connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan Documents
and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing
their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that,
with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and
advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any
statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any parent,
subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any limitation
whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any
of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which govern the
Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of
Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower
hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on
the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of any such rights
or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real
estate financings and other real estate transactions and investments which may
be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business of Borrower or its
Affiliates.

         Section 10.21     Brokers and Financial Advisors. Borrower hereby
                           ------------------------------
represents that it has dealt with no financial advisors, brokers, underwriters,
placement agents, agents or finders in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Lender harmless from and

                                      -92-
<PAGE>

against any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind
(including Lender's attorneys' fees and expenses) in any way relating to or
arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of Borrower
or Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The
provisions of this Section 10.21 shall survive the expiration and termination of
this Agreement and the payment of the Debt.

         Section 10.22     Prior Agreements. This Agreement and the other Loan
                           ----------------
Documents contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior
agreements among or between such parties, whether oral or written, between
Borrower and/or its Affiliates and Lender are superseded by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         Section 10.23     Borrower/Maker. In the event that the Maryland
                           --------------
Guaranty is released as security for the Loan, all references herein to
"Borrower" shall refer solely to "Maker".

               ----------------
Instruments, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents, Lender may sell,
transfer and deliver the Note and assign the Security Instrument, this
Assignment and the Other Security Documents in the secondary mortgage market
whether or not in connection with such sale, Lender may retain or assign
responsibility for servicing the Loan, including the Note, the Security
Instrument, this Assignment and the Other Security Documents, or may delegate

but not limited to, any subservicer or master servicer, on behalf of the
Investors (as defined in the Loan Agreement). All references to Lender herein
shall refer to and include any such servicer to the extent applicable.

          12.  Miscellaneous.

               (a)  Wherever pursuant to this Assignment (i) Lender exercises

faith discretion of Lender and shall be final and conclusive, except as may be

construed, to impose upon the Lender any liability or obligation of the Borrower
under the Cap Agreement.

          13.  Right to Cure Defaults.  In addition to, and in no way limiting
               ----------------------
other remedies available to Lender under this Assignment, the Note, the Security
Instrument, or the Other Security Documents, if Borrower shall default in the
performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition of the Cap
Agreement on the part of Borrower to be performed or observed, then, without
limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Assignment or the
Security Instrument, and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its
obligations hereunder, Lender shall have the right, but shall be under no
obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any act or take any action as may be
appropriate to cause all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Cap
Agreement on the part of Borrower to be performed or observed or to be promptly
performed or observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the rights of
Borrower in, to and under the Cap Agreement shall be kept unimpaired and free
from default. If Lender shall make any payment or perform any act or take action
in accordance with the preceding sentence, Lender will notify Borrower of the
making of any such payment, the performance of any such act, or the taking of
any such action and Borrower shall within ten (10) days after request by Lender,
reimburse Lender for same. Any such payment made or sums expended by Lender on
behalf of Borrower shall be added to the Debt (as defined in the Loan
Agreement).
