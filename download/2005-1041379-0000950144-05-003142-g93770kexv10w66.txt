                                   ARTICLE II

                                   The Credits

      SECTION 2.01 Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Existing Lender listed on Schedule 2.01 hereto agrees (a) that the
Existing Term Loans made by such Existing Lender under the Existing Credit
Agreement shall remain outstanding on and after the Closing Date as "Tranche A
Term Loans" and "Tranche B Term Loans", as applicable, made pursuant to this
Agreement in the same pro rata amount of such Existing Lenders pro rata share of

<PAGE>

borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. Amounts repaid in respect of Term
Loans may not be reborrowed.

      SECTION 2.02 Loans and Borrowings. Each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan)
shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and
Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments
of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to
be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

            (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.14, each Borrowing shall be
      comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may
      request in accordance herewith; provided that all Borrowings made on the
      Closing Date must be made as ABR Borrowings. Each Lender at its option may
      make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or
      Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of
      such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such
      Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Swingline Loan
      shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Swingline Lender's quoted cost
      of funds plus the Eurodollar Spread for Tranche B Term Loans, but in no
      event will such rate exceed a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus
      ABR Spread for Revolving Loans, provided that for all other purposes each
      Swingline Loan shall be deemed to be an ABR Loan.

            (b) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
      Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
      integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time
      that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an
      aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less
      than $1,000,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an
      aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total
      Revolving Loan Commitments or that is required to finance the
      reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.06(e).
      Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
      $100,000 and not less than $1,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type
      and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall
      not at any time be more than a total of 10 Eurodollar Borrowings
      outstanding.

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
      Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
      continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect
      thereto would end after the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Tranche A
      Term Loan Maturity Date or the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date, as
      applicable, (taking into consideration that the Tranche B Term Loan
      Maturity Date occurs subsequent to the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date
      and the Revolving Loan Maturity Date).

      SECTION 2.03 Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving Loan
Borrowing or a Term Loan Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the
date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later

to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section
2.05(e) may be given not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date
of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be

written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance

      funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of
      Section 2.07.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed
to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

      SECTION 2.04 Swingline Loans(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the
Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $15,000,000
and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total Revolving Loan
Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing
limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower
may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

            (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the
      Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy),
      not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed
      Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
      the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the
      requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise
      the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The
      Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower
      by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower as
      designated in the Borrowing Request (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan
      made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
      Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York
      City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

            (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
      Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any
      Business Day require the Revolving Loan Lenders to acquire participations
      on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans
      outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline
      Loans in which the Revolving Loan Lenders will participate. Promptly upon
      receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof
      to each Revolving Loan Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving
      Loan Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.

      Each Revolving Loan Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees,
      upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative
      Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable
      Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Loan Lender
      acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
      Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional
      and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the
      occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the
      Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
      abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Loan Lender
      shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
      immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section
      2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Loan Lender (and Section
      2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
      Revolving Loan Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
      to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving
      Loan Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any
      participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph,
      and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to
      the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts
      received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on
      behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by
      the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein
      shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts
      received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the
      Administrative Agent to the Revolving Loan Lenders that shall have made
      their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as
      their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted
      shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as
      applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded
      to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a
      Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower
      of any default in the payment thereof.

      SECTION 2.05 Letters of Credit (a) General. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of
Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to,
or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

            (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain

      amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
      Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
      communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the
      Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably
      in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
      extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
      identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and
      specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which
      shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to
      expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount
      of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
      and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew
      or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the
      Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing
      Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of
      Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended
      only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter
      of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
      after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i)
      the LC

                                      F-26
<PAGE>

      Exposure shall not exceed $25,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Credit
      Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Loan Commitments.

      renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension)
      and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan
      Maturity Date; provided that the immediately preceding clause (i) shall
      not prevent the Issuing Bank from agreeing that a Letter of Credit will
      automatically be extended for one or more successive periods not to exceed
      one year, each upon prior written request of Borrower which will be
      provided at least 40 days prior to the expiration of such Letter of
      Credit, so long as Issuing Bank notifies Borrower or such beneficiary, as
      the case may be, in writing not less than 20 days prior to the expiration
      date that it has agreed to extend for any such additional period; and
      provided further, that no such extension will be made if a Default has
      occurred and is continuing (and has not been waived) at the time Issuing
      Bank must elect whether or not to allow such extension.

            (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
      amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without
      any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
      Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Loan Lender, and each
      Revolving Loan Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a
      participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Loan
      Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
      drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of
      the foregoing, each Revolving Loan Lender hereby absolutely and
      unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account
      of the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Loan Lender's Applicable Percentage of
      each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the
      Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or
      of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for
      any reason. Each Revolving Loan Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
      obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect
      of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
      affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal
      or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of
      a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each
      such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
      reduction whatsoever.

            (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
      Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall
      reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an
      amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York
      City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower
      shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m.,
      New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received
      by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00
      noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the
      day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received
      prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that, if such LC
      Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000 the Borrower may, subject to the
      conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
      Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
      Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
      financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be
      discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or
      Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the
      Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Loan Lender of the
      applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in
      respect thereof and such Revolving Loan Lender's Applicable Percentage
      thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Loan
      Lender shall

                                      F-27

<PAGE>

      pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment
      then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06
      with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Loan Lender (and Section 2.06
      shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving
      Loan Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
      Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Loan
      Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
      payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative
      Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent
      that Revolving Loan Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph
      to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Loan Lenders and the
      Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a
      Revolving Loan Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing
      Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving
      Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a
      Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse
      such LC Disbursement.

            (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
      Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
      absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly
      in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
      circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
      enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
      provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
      Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any
      respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
      respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
      against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
      with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
      circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
      that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or
      equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
      Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the
      Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have
      any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the
      issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to
      make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances
      referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
      interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
      notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit
      (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error
      in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
      causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing
      shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the
      Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
      damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to
      the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are
      caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
      whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit
      comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in
      the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
      Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction),
      the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
      determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the
      generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
      presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with
      the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole
      discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
      responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
      information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon
      such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
      terms of such Letter of Credit.

            (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
      following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
      represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank
      shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by

                                      F-28

<PAGE>

      telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether
      the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
      provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not
      relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and
      the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

            (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
      Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC
      Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid
      amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the
      date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the
      Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then
      applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to
      reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
      Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that
      interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Loan
      Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing
      Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
      payment.

            (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
      replaced at any time with the written consent of the Borrower, the
      Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing
      Bank, each of which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
      Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of
      the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective,
      the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the
      replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the
      effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank
      shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this
      Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and
      (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer
      to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
      and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
      replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall
      remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and
      obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
      Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
      required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

            (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
      be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from
      the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
      the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing
      greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
      collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an
      account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative
      Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the
      LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
      provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become
      effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
      payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence
      of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause
      (i) or (j) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the
      Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
      obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent
      shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
      of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
      investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option
      and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent or at the request of the
      Borrower, and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not
      bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
      accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
      Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements
      for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied,
      shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement

                                      F-29

<PAGE>

      obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the
      maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
      Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC
      Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under
      this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
      collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default,
      such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to
      the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have
      been cured or waived.

      SECTION 2.06 Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan
to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided
in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

            (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
      a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
      not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
      Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
      such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
      Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
      Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in
      fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
      Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower
      severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
      such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
      including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
      excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
      case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
      rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
      industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the
      Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays
      such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute
      such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

      SECTION 2.07 Interest Elections (a) Each Revolving Loan Borrowing and Term
Loan Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the
Borrower may elect to convert such Revolving Loan Borrowing or the Term Loan
Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of
a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing,
and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be
converted or continued.

            (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
      notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
      that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the
      Borrower were requesting a Revolving Loan Borrowing of the Type resulting
      from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each
      such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall
      be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative
      Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a

                                      F-30

<PAGE>

      form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

            (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
      specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

            (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
      and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
      portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
      Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
      clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
      Borrowing);

            (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
      Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

            (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
      Eurodollar Borrowing; and

            (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
      Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
      election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
      term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

            (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
      Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and
      of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

            (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
      Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
      Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid
      as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing
      shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary
      provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
      and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so
      notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing
      (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a
      Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing
      shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period
      applicable thereto.

      SECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) [Reserved.]

            (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
      reduce, the Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction
      of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an amount that is an
      integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or lesser
      amount if the outstanding Revolving Loan Commitments are less) and (ii)
      the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments
      if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
      accordance with Section 2.10, the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed
      the total Revolving Loan Commitments.

            (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
      election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments under
      paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the
      effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such

                                      F-31

<PAGE>

      election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any
      notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
      thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section
      shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the
      Revolving Loan Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such
      notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities,
      in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the
      Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
      condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
      Loans Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Loan
      Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
      their respective Revolving Loan Commitments.

      SECTION 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt (a) The Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Tranche A Term
Loan on the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date and the unpaid principal amount of
such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan on the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date and
(iii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline
Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and the first date after
such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and
is at least three Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that
on each date that a Revolving Loan Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay
all Swingline Loans then outstanding.

            (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
      an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
      Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
      of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
      time hereunder.

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
      shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and
      Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount
      of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable
      from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
      received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the
      Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

            (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
      paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
      existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that
      the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such
      accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
      obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms
      of this Agreement.

            (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
      promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and
      deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such
      Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
      assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter,
      the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at
      all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be
      represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the
      order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a
      registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

      SECTION 2.10 Prepayment of Loans (a) The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with

                                      F-32

<PAGE>

paragraph (b) of this Section.

            (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the
      case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone
      (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
      prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon., New York
      City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the
      case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon., New
      York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in
      the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New
      York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
      irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount
      of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a
      notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
      termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments as contemplated by Section
      2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of
      termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following
      receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Loan Borrowing or a
      Term Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
      the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Loan
      Borrowing or any Term Loan Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be
      permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Loan Borrowing or a
      Term Loan Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except
      as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment.
      Each prepayment of a Revolving Loan Borrowing or a Term Loan Borrowing
      shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
      Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
      required by Section 2.13.

            (c) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are
      received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of
      any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, within one Business Day after
      such Net Proceeds are received, prepay Term Loan Borrowings in accordance
      with paragraph (e) below in an aggregate amount equal to such Net
      Proceeds; provided that, in the case of any event described in clause (a)
      or (b) of the definition of the term Prepayment Event or in the case of
      any issuance of Capital Stock by the Subsidiaries to finance a Permitted
      Acquisition, if the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a
      certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that the Borrower and the
      Subsidiaries intend to apply the Net Proceeds from such event or issuance
      (or a portion thereof specified in such certificate), within 360 days
      after receipt of such Net Proceeds, to (i) acquire real property,
      equipment or other tangible assets to be used in the business of the
      Borrower and the Subsidiaries (or in the case of an event described in
      clause (b) of the definition of the term Prepayment Event, to promptly and
      diligently apply such Net Proceeds to pay or reimburse the cost of
      repairing or restoring or replacing the assets in respect of which such
      Net Proceeds were received) or (ii) make Permitted Acquisitions, within
      360 days of receipt thereof (other than Net Proceeds received from
      business interruption insurance for working capital and general corporate
      purposes), and certifying that no Default has occurred and is continuing,
      then no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this paragraph in respect
      of the Net Proceeds in respect of such event (or the portion of such Net
      Proceeds specified in such certificate, if applicable) except to the
      extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by
      the end of such 360 day period, at which time a prepayment shall be
      required in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so
      applied. In addition, in the event and on each occasion that the Borrower
      or any Subsidiary shall sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any asset
      (whether or not such transaction shall constitute a Prepayment Event), if
      the Borrower would be required to prepay or redeem, or to offer to prepay
      or redeem, any Subordinated Debt as a result of such transaction unless
      the proceeds of such transaction are applied within a specified period to
      prepay Term Loan Borrowings (or otherwise reinvested as permitted in
      accordance with the terms of such Subordinated Debt), then the Borrower
      shall (unless such proceeds are otherwise reinvested within the specified
      period in a

                                      F-33

<PAGE>

      manner that relieves the Borrower of any such requirement in respect of
      the Subordinated Debt) prepay Term Loan Borrowings in accordance with
      paragraph (e) below within such specified period to the extent necessary
      to relieve the Borrower of any such requirement. In the event the Borrower
      receives any such Net Proceeds (not immediately reinvested in accordance
      with this Section 2.10(c)) in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate in
      any fiscal year, the Borrower shall within three Business Days of receipt
      thereof, deposit such excess Net Proceeds in the Breakage Cost Cash
      Collateral Account, pending the application of such Net Proceeds in
      accordance with this Section 2.10(c). Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary set forth herein, at the Borrower's option, the Net Proceeds from
      Specified Asset Sales may be used to prepay Revolving Loans, provided such
      amount may only be re-borrowed as Revolving Loans to make reinvestments or
      prepayments in accordance with this Section 2.10(c). Furthermore,
      notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the Borrower
      shall be not be required to apply the cash proceeds of the Church's
      Disposition as prepayments against the Loans

            (d) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, the
      Borrowers shall prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal
      to: (i) 50% of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year in
      accordance with paragraph (e) below if the Total Leverage Ratio is greater
      than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 on the last day of such fiscal year or (ii)
      25% of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year in accordance
      with paragraph (e) below if the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 2.00 to
      1.00 on the last day of such fiscal year. Each prepayment pursuant to this
      paragraph shall be made on or before the date on which the certificate of
      the Financial Officer of the Borrower is delivered pursuant to Section
      5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which Consolidated Excess Cash
      Flow is being calculated (and in any event within 90 days after the end of
      such fiscal year); provided, further, that in no event shall any Lender be
      required to refund any amounts prepaid.

            (e) Prior to any optional prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the
      Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall
      specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
      paragraph (b) of this Section. In the event of any mandatory prepayment of
      Term Loan Borrowings made at a time when Term Loan Borrowings of more than
      one Class remain outstanding, the Borrower shall select Term Loan
      Borrowings to be prepaid so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment
      is allocated among the Tranche A Term Loan Borrowings and the Tranche B
      Term Loan Borrowings pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of
      outstanding Borrowings of each such Class; provided that any Tranche B
      Term Loan Lender may elect (so long as amounts are outstanding under the
      Tranche A Term Loans), by notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone
      (confirmed by telecopy) at least one Business Day prior to the prepayment
      date, to decline all or any portion of any prepayment of its Tranche B
      Term Loans pursuant to this Section (other than an optional prepayment
      pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, which may not be declined), in
      which case Borrower may elect to retain up to 50% of the aggregate amount
      of the prepayment that would have been applied to prepay Tranche B Term
      Loans but was so declined and the balance thereof not retained by Borrower
      shall be applied to prepay Tranche A Term Loan Borrowings.

            (f) If on any day on which Loans would otherwise be required to be
      prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.10, (each a "Prepayment Date"), the
      amount of such required prepayment exceeds the then outstanding aggregate
      principal amount of ABR Loans which are of the Class required to be
      prepaid, and no Default exists or is continuing, then on such Prepayment
      Date, at any time following the establishment of the Breakage Cost Cash
      Collateral Account pursuant to Section 8.02, at the election of Borrower,
      (i) Borrower shall deposit Dollars into the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral
      Account in an amount equal to such excess, and only the outstanding ABR
      Loans which are of the Class required to be prepaid shall be required to
      be prepaid on such Prepayment

                                      F-34

<PAGE>

      Date and (ii) on the last day of each Interest Period after such
      Prepayment Date in effect with respect to a Eurodollar Loan which is of
      the Class required to be prepaid, the Administrative Agent is irrevocably
      authorized and directed to apply funds from the Breakage Cost Cash
      Collateral Account (and liquidate investments held in the Breakage Cost
      Cash Collateral Account as necessary) to prepay such Eurodollar Loans for
      which the Interest Period is then ending to the extent funds are available
      in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account. Notwithstanding any
      prepayment of Loans made in connection the foregoing, the Borrower shall
      maintain in the Breakage Cost Collateral Account an amount not less than
      $110,500,000 (the "Escrow Amount") from the proceeds of the Church's
      Disposition; provided, that to the extent the Revolving Credit Exposure on
      the Closing Date exceeds $24,706,330, the Escrow Amount shall be increased
      by a like amount on a dollar for dollar basis. None of the Escrow Amount
      shall be released from the Breakage Cost Collateral Account without the
      written consent of each Lender; provided, however, that (i) upon written
      request by the Borrower an aggregate amount of $30,000,000 may be released
      upon approval by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, (ii)
      Borrower may use the Escrow Amount to prepay all of the outstanding Loans,
      provided, that the Borrower must at the same time irrevocably terminate
      (such termination being permanent) all of the outstanding Revolving Loan
      Commitments, (iii) to the extent the Borrower makes any prepayments of the
      Loans (and in the case of Revolving Loans to make simultaneous permanent
      reductions in the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount equal the amount
      of such prepayments) in excess of $30,000,000, the Escrow Amount shall be
      reduced by such amount above $30,000,000 on a dollar for dollar basis and
      (iv) to the extent there are no outstanding Term Loan Commitments, the
      Escrow Amount shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis with the
      amount of any permanent reductions in the Revolving Loan Commitments.


      SECTION 2.11 Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to adjustment
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Borrower shall repay the Tranche
A Term Loan on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount equal
to the amount of the Tranche A Term Loans set forth opposite such date:

            (c)To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Tranche A Term Loans
      shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Term Loan Maturity Date and (ii)
      all Tranche B Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche B Term
      Loan Maturity Date.

            (d) Any prepayment of a Term Loan Borrowing of any Class shall be
      applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Loan
      Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section ratably. If
      the aggregate amount of the Lenders' Term Loan Commitments of any Class
      exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans of such Class that
      are made on the Closing Date, then the scheduled repayments of Term Loan
      Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section shall be
      reduced ratably by an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

            (e) Prior to any repayment of any Term Loan Borrowings of any Class
      hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the
      applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by
      telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 12:00
      noon., New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date
      of such repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably
      to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term Loan
      Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.

      SECTION 2.12 Fees. (a) Borrower agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for
distribution to each Lender in proportion to that Lender's Applicable Percentage
(i) of the Revolving Loan Commitments (other than Swingline Loan Commitments),
commitment fees for the period from and including the Closing Date to and
excluding the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, equal to the average of the daily
excess of the Revolving Loan Commitments, as then in effect, over the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Exposure multiplied by the
applicable Facility Fee Rate and (ii) commitment fees for the period from and
including the Closing Date to and excluding the Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing
Date, equal to the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment multiplied by the applicable
Facility Fee Rate. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the
third business day following the last day of March, June, September and December
of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on
the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility
fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable
on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day).

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for
      the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
      participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same
      Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to
      Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC
      Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
      Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date to
      but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment
      terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC
      Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
      at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC
      Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
      Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date to
      but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and
      the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the
      Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment,
      renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings
      thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and
      including the last day of

                                      F-36

<PAGE>

      March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the
      third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such
      date to occur after the Closing Date; provided that all such fees shall be
      payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees
      accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be
      payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All
      participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a
      year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
      elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

            (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
      own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
      agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

            (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
      immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the
      Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the
      case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid
      shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

      SECTION 2.13 Interest.

            (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at
the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Agreement, Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Swingline
Lender quoted cost of funds plus the Applicable Rate (Eurodollar Spread) for
Tranche B Term Loans; provided, however, that Swingline Loans shall bear
interest at a rate no higher than at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate (ABR Spread) for Revolving Loans.

            (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
      interest in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for
      the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
      on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder
      is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
      otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as
      before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
      principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan
      as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the
      case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as
      provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

            (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
      each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving
      Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that
      (i) interest accrued pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.13 shall
      be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of
      any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the
      end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount
      repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or
      prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan
      prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest
      on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

            (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
      of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
      Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate
      shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days

                                      F-37

<PAGE>

      in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number
      of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
      applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be
      determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
      conclusive absent manifest error.

            (f) [Reserved].

      SECTION 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

            (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
      be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
      not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
      applicable, for such Interest Period; or

            (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the any of the Lenders
      that the making of Eurodollar Loan (i) has become unlawful as a result of
      compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental
      rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such
      treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the
      force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be
      unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable, or would cause such Lender
      material hardship, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date
      of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect the interbank
      Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in that market, then, and
      in any such event, such Lender shall be an "Affected Lender" and it shall
      on that day give notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in
      writing) to Borrower and Administrative Agent of such determination (which
      notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).

      Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or
to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall
be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such determination by the
Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Loan then being requested by Borrower
pursuant to a Borrowing Request or a notice of conversion/continuation, the
Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case
may be) a ABR Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its
outstanding Eurodollar Loans (the "Affected Loans") shall be terminated at the
earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with
respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (d) the Affected
Loans shall automatically convert into ABR Loans on the date of such
termination.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an
Affected Lender as described above relates to a Eurodollar Loan then being
requested by Borrower pursuant to a Borrowing Request or a notice of
conversion/continuation, Borrower shall have the option to rescind such
Borrowing Request or notice of conversion/continuation as to all Lenders by
giving notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender
gives and Borrower receives notice of its determination as described above
(which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each
other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing
in this subsection (b) shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an
Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

      SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

            (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
      or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
      of, or credit

                                      F-38

<PAGE>

      extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in
      the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

            (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
      interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
      Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
      participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to increase the cost to
such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

            (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in
      Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
      reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital
      or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company,
      if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or
      participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters
      of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such
      Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
      company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
      consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the
      policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with
      respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
      to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional
      amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or
      such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction
      suffered.

            (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
      amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank
      or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsections
      (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 and setting forth in reasonable detail the
      basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender or
      Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall be delivered to the Borrower and
      shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such
      Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on
      any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

            (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank
      to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
      waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such
      compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
      compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any
      increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the
      date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies
      the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
      reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim
      compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving
      rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
      270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period
      of retroactive effect thereof.

      SECTION 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of
any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Eurodollar Loan on

                                      F-39

<PAGE>

the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of
whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in
accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request
by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower
shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO
Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date
of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of
interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other
banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
amounts owed shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

      SECTION 2.17 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or
Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make
such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
      relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
      Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
      for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
      Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
      on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of
      the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
      or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and
      any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
      respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
      correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
      Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
      delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
      Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the
      Issuing Bank, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating
      the additional amounts owed, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
      Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
      shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy
      of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
      payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
      such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                                      F-40

<PAGE>

            (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
      reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
      the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
      party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the
      Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
      prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
      documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
      Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at
      a reduced rate. For any period with respect to which a Foreign Lender has
      failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other
      document requested by Borrower, such Foreign Lender shall not be entitled
      to indemnification with respect to Taxes by reason of such failure unless
      such form is provided within a reasonable time after the end of such
      period.

            (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
      discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as
      to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which
      the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it
      shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of
      indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under
      this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
      such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
      Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by
      the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
      provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent
      or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
      any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
      Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the
      event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
      refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed
      to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its
      tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
      confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

      SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder
(whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or
of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available
funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on
any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have
been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at
its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made
directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein
and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be
made directly on behalf of the Persons entitled thereto. Payment to the
Administrative Agent other than as described above shall constitute payment to
the Lender. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received
by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that
is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in dollars.

            (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
      to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
      unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such
      funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees
      then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
      accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties,
      and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC
      Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
      thereto in

                                      F-41

<PAGE>

      accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements
      then due to such parties.

            (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
      counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of
      or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in
      LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
      payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving
      Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
      Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any
      other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
      purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans,
      Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of
      other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such
      payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the
      aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
      Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and
      Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are
      purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
      recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
      restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
      provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
      payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
      express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as
      consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of
      its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or
      participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
      thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The
      Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
      effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
      participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
      the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
      participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the
      Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
      the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
      hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
      Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in
      accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute
      to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In
      such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each
      of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees
      to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
      distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each
      day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
      excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater
      of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
      Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
      interbank compensation.

            (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
      by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d),
      then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
      contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
      Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
      Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied
      obligations are fully paid.

      SECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates,

                                      F-42

<PAGE>

if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.17, as
the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender, in such
Lender's reasonable judgment, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any
such designation or assignment.

            (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if
      the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
      Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
      2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder,
      then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
      Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
      delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
      restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
      obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
      obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
      such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the
      prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
      unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of
      an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
      participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
      thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from
      the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
      interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and
      (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
      compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant
      to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
      compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
      assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
      such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
      require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

            (c) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in
      the event that in connection with any proposed amendment, modification,
      termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions
      hereof as contemplated by Section 9.02, the consent of one or more Lenders
      (each a "Non-Consenting Lender") whose consent is required shall not have
      been obtained; then, with respect to such Non-Consenting Lender (the
      "Terminated Lender"), the Borrower may, by giving written notice to
      Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so,
      elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby
      irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its Revolving
      Commitments, if any, in full to one or more assignees (each a "Replacement
      Lender") in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.04 and the
      Borrower shall pay any fees payable thereunder in connection with such
      assignment; provided, (1) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement
      Lender shall pay to Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum of (A) an
      amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all
      outstanding Loans of the Terminated Lender, (B) an amount equal to all
      unreimbursed drawings that have been funded by such Terminated Lender,
      together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time
      and (C) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid fees owing
      to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.12, (2) on the date of
      such assignment, Borrower shall pay any amounts payable to such Terminated
      Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, 2.15 or 2.17; or otherwise as if it were
      a prepayment and (3) each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of
      such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender
      was a Non-Consenting Lender; provided, the Borrower may not make such
      election with respect to any Terminated Lender that is also an Issuing
      Bank unless, prior to the effectiveness of such election, the Borrower
      shall have caused each outstanding Letter of Credit issued thereby to be
      cancelled. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated
      Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender's Revolving
      Commitments, if

                                      F-43

<PAGE>

      any, such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for
      purposes hereof; provided, any rights of such Terminated Lender to
      indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

      SECTION 2.20 [Reserved].

                                  ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

            The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders on the Closing
Date, on the date of each Borrowing and on the date of issuance of each Letter
of Credit, that:

      SECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

      SECTION 3.02 Authorization; Enforceability. The Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are within the Borrower's corporate powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required,
stockholder action. Each of this Agreement and the Security Documents has been
duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

      SECTION 3.03 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (a) do not require any consent or approval of,
registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority
which has not been or will not be timely obtained, registered or filed, as the
case may be, except (x) as such have been obtained or made and are in full force
and effect or (y) filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan
Documents, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter,
by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or
result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a
right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries other than as
anticipated and created under the Loan Documents.

      SECTION 3.04 Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) The
Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet
and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows as of and for the
fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, reported on by KMPG LLP, independent public
accountants, certified by its chief financial officer. Such financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of
operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP.

            (b) Since December 28, 2003, there has been no adverse change in the
      business, assets,

                                      F-44

<PAGE>

      operations, prospects or condition, financial or otherwise, of the
      Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole which would have or could
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 3.05 Properties. (a) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
good, marketable fee title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and
personal property material to its business, except for Permitted Encumbrances
and minor defects in title that do not materially interfere with its ability to
conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for
their intended purposes.

            (b) With respect to substantially all of the operating leases for
      Real Property Assets (each a "Real Property Lease") pursuant to which the
      Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, each of the
      following is true except to the extent that, if not true, the consequences
      of same would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
      Effect:

            (i) such Real Property Leases are in full force and effect;

            (ii) to the best knowledge of Borrower, all rent, additional rent
      and/or other charges reserved in or payable by Borrower or its applicable
      Subsidiary, as tenant, under the Real Property Leases, have been paid to
      the extent that they have been determined and are payable to the date
      hereof and are not being contested in good faith by Borrower, any such
      amounts being contested have been paid or rescinded for by Borrower or its
      applicable Subsidiary, and no such contest may reasonably be expected to
      result in the exercise by the applicable landlord of a remedy of
      termination of such Real Property Lease;

            (iii) to the actual knowledge of Borrower, no Person has questioned
      Borrower's or its applicable Subsidiary's quiet and peaceful possession of
      the premises which are the subject of such Real Property Lease;

            (iv) no default by Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary, as tenant,
      under any of the material terms of any Real Property Lease has occurred
      and remains uncured; nor, to the best knowledge of Borrower, is there any
      existing condition which, with the passage of time or the giving of
      notice, or both, would result in a default by Borrower or its applicable
      Subsidiary under the terms of any Real Property Lease;

            (v) Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall, or shall cause its
      applicable Subsidiary to, other than in the ordinary course of business
      and if such action would not reasonably be expected to result in a
      Material Adverse Effect,: (A) promptly and faithfully observe, perform and
      comply with all the material terms, covenants and provisions of each Real
      Property Lease on its part to be observed, performed and complied with,
      within the applicable grace periods, if any; (B) refrain from doing
      anything, as a result of which, there could be a material default under or
      a breach of any of the terms of any Real Property Lease; (C) not do,
      permit or suffer any event or omission as a result of which there would
      occur a default or breach under any Real Property Lease after the passing
      of the applicable grace periods, if any; (D) not cancel, terminate,
      surrender, modify, amend or in any way alter or permit the alteration of
      any of the provisions of any Real Property Lease or grant any material
      consents or waivers thereunder; and not exercise any right it may have
      under any Real Property Lease to cancel or surrender the same without the
      prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such consent not to be
      unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and (E) give the
      Administrative Agent any notice of any default under any "Material Real

                                      F-45

<PAGE>


      Property Leases" received or sent by Borrower or its applicable
      Subsidiary, within three (3) Business Days and promptly deliver to the
      Administrative Agent a copy of all responses to default notices, similar
      instruments received or delivered by Borrower or its applicable
      Subsidiary, in connection with any Material Real Property Leases. As used
      herein, "Material Real Property Lease" means the office lease for
      Borrower's headquarters at Six Concourse Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia and any
      other lease the Borrower or its Subsidiaries may enter into with an
      aggregate value of rental payments exceeding $100,000 in any 12 month
      period.

            (c) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed
      to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
      intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
      Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any
      other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in
      the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
      Adverse Effect.

            (d) The properties listed on Schedule 1.1A are all of Borrower's
      existing fee owned real property assets in Texas, Arizona, Mississippi,
      New Mexico, Missouri and California as of the Closing Date.

      SECTION 3.06 Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this
Agreement or the Loan Documents.

            (b) Except for with respect to any matters that, individually or in
      the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
      Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has
      failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
      comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
      Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability,
      (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental
      Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No material default has
occurred and is continuing with respect to any of the aforementioned in this
Section 3.07.

      SECTION 3.08 Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither the Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or

a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 3.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected
to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which
liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair
market value of the assets of such Plan.

      SECTION 3.11 Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the other
reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or
on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading in any material respect; provided that, with respect
to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time.

      SECTION 3.12 Licenses, etc. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have
obtained and hold in full force and effect, all franchises, licenses, permits,
certificates, authorizations, qualifications, accreditations, easements, rights
of way and other rights, consents and approvals which are necessary for the
operation of their respective businesses as presently conducted, except where
the failure to obtain and hold the same, individually or in the aggregate, may
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 3.13 Labor Matters. As of the Closing Date, there are no strikes,
lockouts, slowdowns or any other material labor disputes against the Borrower or
any Subsidiary pending or threatened. All payments due from the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and
other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the
Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Agreement will not give
rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any
union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is bound.

      SECTION 3.14 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. All proceeds of each
Loan, and each Letter of Credit, will be used by the Borrower only in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.08. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be
used by the Borrower to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit
to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. Neither
the making of any Loan nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be
inconsistent with the provisions of Regulations U or X.

      SECTION 3.15 Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.15 sets forth the name of, and the
ownership interest of the Borrower in, each Subsidiary of the Borrower and
identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each case as of
the Closing Date.

      SECTION 3.16 Security Interests. The representations and warranties in the
Security Documents are true and correct in all material respects.

                                      F-47

      SECTION 3.17 Insurance. Schedule 3.17 sets forth a description of all
insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date. Except as noted on Schedule 3.17, as of the Closing, all
premiums in respect of such insurance have been paid. The Borrower believes that
the insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is
adequate.

      SECTION 3.18 Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the Agreement
and the Church's Disposition to occur on or after the Closing Date, (a) the fair
value of the assets of all of the Loan Parties, at a fair valuation, will exceed
their collective debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise;
(b) Borrower and its Subsidiaries are able to pay their collective debts and
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured; and (c) Borrower and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, do not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct
their respective businesses in which they are engaged, as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date.

Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies (a) insurance in such amounts (with no greater risk retention) and
against such risks as are customarily maintained by companies of established
repute engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or
similar locations including, without limitation, appropriate environmental
liability insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in any
case no less favorable than that which the Borrower has in place on the Closing
Date, to a date not less than six months following the Tranche B Term Loan
Maturity Date and (b) all insurance required to be maintained pursuant to the
Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower
will maintain or cause to be maintained flood insurance with respect to each
Flood Hazard Property that is located in a community that participates in the
National Flood Insurance Program, in each case in compliance with any applicable
regulations of the Board of

                                      F-53
<PAGE>

Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Borrower will furnish to the
Lenders, upon request of the Administrative Agent, information in reasonable
detail as to the insurance so maintained.

      SECTION 5.10 Information Regarding Collateral. (a) The Borrower will
furnish to the Administrative Agent prompt written notice of any changes as
required by the Collateral Agreement (i) in any Loan Party's corporate name or
in any trade name used to identify it in the conduct of its business or in the
ownership of its properties, (ii) in the location of any Loan Party's chief
executive office, its principal place of business, any office in which it
maintains books or records relating to Collateral owned by it or any office or
facility at which Collateral owned by it is located (including the establishment
of any such new office or facility), (iii) in any Loan Party's identity,
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, or corporate or organizational
structure or (iv) in any Loan Party's Organization Identification Number. The
Borrower agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in the preceding
sentence unless all filings have been made under the Uniform Commercial Code or
otherwise that are required in order for the Administrative Agent to continue at
all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected security
interest in all the Collateral. The Borrower also agrees promptly to notify the
Administrative Agent if any material portion of the Collateral is damaged or
destroyed.

            (b) Each year, at the time of delivery of annual financial
      statements with respect to the preceding fiscal year pursuant to clause
      (a) of Section 5.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
      Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth
      the information required pursuant to the Perfection Certificate or
      confirming that there has been no change in such information since the
      date of the Perfection Certificate delivered on the Initial Effective Date
      or the date of the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this
      Section.

      SECTION 5.11 Additional Subsidiaries and Real Property Assets. (a) If any
additional Subsidiary is formed or acquired after the Closing Date, the Borrower
will notify the Administrative Agent thereof and, within ten Business Days (or
such longer period as the Administrative Agent may permit in light of the
circumstances) after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired, cause the Collateral
and Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied with respect to such Subsidiary (if it
is a Subsidiary Loan Party) and to any Equity Interest in or Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary owned by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the extent required
by the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement. The Borrower shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to have domestic Subsidiaries that
are not Subsidiary Loan Parties comply with the Collateral and Guarantee
Requirement, including, without limitation, having third party stockholders of
any such Subsidiary provide any necessary consents to such compliance.

            (b) With respect to any Real Property Asset that individually has a
book value upon acquisition in excess of $250,000, and upon the aggregate book
value of properties acquired exceeding $5,000,000 any Real Property Asset that
individually has a book value upon acquisition in excess of $100,000, to be
acquired by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (each an
"Acquisition Property" and collectively, the "Acquisition Properties") Borrower
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) not less than ten (10) Business
days after the acquisition thereof, notify Administrative Agent in writing of
such acquisition; (ii) not later than five days after a Mortgage is delivered to
Borrower, execute and deliver the Mortgage to Administrative Agent (each an
"Additional Mortgage" and collectively the "Additional Mortgages") duly executed
by the Borrower or applicable Subsidiary together with evidence that such
Additional Mortgage has been recorded in all places to the extent necessary or
desirable, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent, so as to
effectively create a valid and enforceable first priority lien, subject to
Permitted Encumbrances, on such Acquisition Property in favor of Administrative
Agent (or such other trustee as may be required or desired under local law) for
the benefit of Lenders; (iii) not later than the date on which such Mortgage is
delivered, have delivered to Administrative Agent a title report in respect of
any such Acquisition Property; (iv) if such Acquisition Property is to be held
by Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries as a leasehold interest, exercise

                                      F-54
<PAGE>

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Administrative Agent
(x) the consent of the lessor thereof to the encumbering by Borrower or the
applicable Subsidiary of its leasehold interest as a condition to Borrower's
obligation to deliver an Additional Mortgage and (y) upon the request of
Administrative Agent, deliver to Administrative Agent an estoppel letter from
the landlord, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
Agent, environmental audits prepared by nationally recognized professional
consultants or other consultants mutually acceptable to Borrower and
Administrative Agent, in form, scope and substance satisfactory to
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if a Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to comply with this
Section 5.11 with respect to all Real Property Assets within 60 days of receipt
of notice of such Default from the Administrative Agent. The Borrower will, no
less than once during each six month period, provide the Administrative Agent
with a list of real property acquired by Borrower and its Subsidiaries since the
date of the last list provided pursuant to this Section 5.11.

            (c) If Borrower or any Subsidiary is required to deliver an
Additional Mortgage with respect to any Acquisition Property, Borrower shall
deliver or shall cause such subsidiary to deliver to Administrative Agent, and
promptly thereafter evidence that such Additional Mortgage has been recorded in
all places to the extent necessary or desirable, in the reasonable judgment of
Administrative Agent, so as to effectively create a valid and enforceable first
priority lien, subject to Permitted Encumbrances, on such Acquisition Property
in favor of Administrative Agent (or such other trustee as may be required or
desired under local law) for the benefit of Lenders; an ALTA mortgage title
insurance policy if available in the jurisdiction in which the Acquisition
Property is located (each an "Additional Mortgagee Policy" and collectively, the
"Additional Mortgagee Policies") issued by the Title Company, in an amount
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent (but not in excess of
Administrative Agent's reasonable determination of the fair market value of the
Acquisition Property), assuring Administrative Agent that the Additional
Mortgage in connection with the acquisition thereof creates a valid and
enforceable first priority mortgage lien on such Acquisition Property, free and
clear of all defects and encumbrances except Permitted Encumbrances, and subject
to a standard survey exception, and which Additional Mortgagee Policy shall
provide for affirmative insurance and such reinsurance as Administrative Agent
may reasonably request, all of the foregoing in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent. If any Real Property Asset of Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries is to be leased or subleased by the Borrower or
applicable Subsidiary to a non-Affiliate of Borrower, Administrative Agent
agrees to deliver, on behalf of itself and all Lenders an agreement of
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (subject to such necessary modifications to comply with the
laws of the applicable jurisdiction in which it will be filed), subordinating
the leasehold interest of such third party to the Additional Mortgage and the
Lien created thereby, which agreement shall be executed by Borrower or the
applicable Subsidiary as lessor (or sublessor, as the case may be) and the
lessee (or sublessee, as the case may be).

            (d) If no Default has occurred and is continuing and Borrower or any
Subsidiary Loan Party sells any Mortgaged Property or Acquisition Property to a
franchisee or non-Affiliate of Borrower in connection with the sale of the land
and/or improvements (building, furniture, fixtures and equipment) thereon to
such franchisee or non-Affiliate of Borrower, then Administrative Agent shall
deliver a release of the Mortgage or Additional Mortgage to Borrower's counsel
or to the relevant Title Company, to be held in trust pending the closing of any
such sale.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative
Agent may in its sole discretion exclude particular Real Property Assets from
the Collateral if it determines that the cost or impracticality of including
such assets would be excessive or disproportionate in relation to (i) the
benefits to the Lenders and (ii) the value of such Real Property Asset.

      SECTION 5.12 Compliance with Contractual Obligations. The Borrower will,
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply in all material respects with
its obligations under each agreement to which it is a party and enforce its
rights thereunder in a commercially reasonable manner, to the extent a failure
to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 5.13 Further Assurances. (a) The Borrower will, and will cause
each Subsidiary Loan Party to, execute any and all further documents, financing
statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions
(including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings,
mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents), which may be required under any
applicable law, or which the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may
reasonably request, to cause the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to be and
remain satisfied, all at the expense of the Loan Parties. The Borrower also
agreesf to provide to the Administrative Agent, from time to time upon request,
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to the
perfection and priority of the Liens created or intended to be created by the
Security Documents.

            (b) If any material assets other than Real Property Assets addressed
in Section 5.11 are acquired by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party after
the Closing Date (other than assets constituting Collateral under the Collateral
Agreement that become subject to the Lien of the Collateral Agreement upon
acquisition thereof), the Borrower will notify the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders thereof, and, if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders, the Borrower will cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing
the Obligations and will take, and cause the Subsidiary Loan Parties to take,
such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent to grant and perfect such Liens, including actions described in paragraph
(a) of this Section, all at the expense of the Loan Parties.

      SECTION 5.14 Casualty and Condemnation. The Borrower (a) will furnish to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prompt written notice of any casualty
or other insured damage to any material portion of any Collateral or the
commencement of any action or proceeding for the taking of any Collateral or any
part thereof or interest therein under power of eminent domain or by
condemnation or similar proceeding and (b) will ensure that the Net Proceeds of
any such event (whether in the form of insurance proceeds, condemnation awards
or otherwise) are collected and applied in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Security Documents; provided, however, so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred or be continuing, Borrower or its Subsidiaries may
retain and apply such Net Proceeds in accordance with the provision of Section
2.10(c).

      SECTION 5.15 End of Fiscal Years; Fiscal Quarters. The Borrower will, for
financial reporting purposes, cause each of its fiscal years and quarters to end
on the dates shown on the period calendar attached hereto as Schedule 5.15.

                                   ARTICLE VI

      pledgor of Collateral under the Loan Documents to which such obligor is a
      party) pursuant to the terms of the intercompany notes; (iv) such
      intercompany Indebtedness shall be reduced pro tanto by the amount of any
      payments made by such obligor in respect of its Obligations under any
      guarantee of the Obligations; and (v) the intercompany notes evidencing
      such indebtedness shall be pledged to Lenders;

series of transactions) all or substantially all of its assets, or all or
substantially all of the stock of any of the Subsidiary Loan Parties (in each
case, whether now owned or hereafter acquired), or liquidate or dissolve, except
that, if at the time thereof and immediately after giving effect thereto no
Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing (i) any
Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower in a transaction in which the Borrower is
the surviving corporation, (ii) any Subsidiary may merge into any Subsidiary in
a transaction in which the surviving entity is a Subsidiary; provided that to

entity shall be a Subsidiary Loan Party, (iii) any Subsidiary may sell,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its assets to the Borrower or to another
Subsidiary, (iv) any Subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve if the Borrower
determines in good faith that such liquidation or dissolution is in the best
interests of the Borrower and is not materially disadvantageous to the Lenders;
provided that any such merger involving a Person that is not a wholly owned
Subsidiary immediately prior to such merger shall not be permitted unless also
permitted by Section 6.04, (v) Borrower and its Subsidiaries may sell or
otherwise dispose of assets in transactions that do not constitute Asset Sales;
provided that the consideration received for such assets shall be in amount at
least equal to the fair market value thereof, (vi) Borrower or its Subsidiaries
may make Specified Asset Sales provided that, such Specified Asset Sales can be
made for Cash or non-Cash consideration until the amount of non-Cash
consideration exceeds $10,000,000 in the aggregate; thereafter, such Specified
Asset Sales shall be made for at least 66 2/3% in Cash (provided that the

shall not apply to the asset sales described under clause (iv) of the definition
of Specified Asset Sales), (vii) Borrower or its Subsidiaries may take any
action permitted by Section 6.04 below to the extent constituting an Asset Sale,

not in excess of $20,000,000 in any fiscal year; provided that (A) the
consideration received for each such Asset Sale shall be in an amount at least

Delaware or the State of Georgia, and (x) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Borrower shall be permitted to enter into and consummate

released from any further obligations in connection with this Agreement and the
Loan Documents, so long as the aggregate amount of gross proceeds from the
Church's Disposition are no less than $375,000,000 (the "Church's Gross
Proceeds").

            (b) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, engage to any material extent in any business other than
businesses of the type conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the
date of execution of this Agreement and businesses reasonably related thereto
and that will not materially change its or its Subsidiary's material lines of
business taken as a whole as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
the type of business conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date is the franchising of food-service related businesses and the
provision of directly related services and products and the distribution,
wholesale and retailing of food and food related products.

      SECTION 6.04 Investments, Loans, Advances, Guarantees and Acquisitions.

            (c) Investments consisting of extensions of credit to franchisees as
      permitted by Section 6.01 or which otherwise provide credit support to
      franchisees in respect of the deferral of royalty payments, rental
      payments, taxes, equipment sales, financing of restaurant properties,
      franchise agreements and development or territory agreements of such
      franchisees which together with Indebtedness permitted under Section
      6.01(d) shall not exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate;

            (d) Guarantees constituting Indebtedness permitted by Section 6.01;

      Lenders or (ii) to the extent made in consideration of the issuance of
      Capital Stock of the Borrower or with the proceeds of the issuance of
      Capital Stock of the Borrower (which proceeds are not required to be used
      to prepay the Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(c));

Agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to hedge or mitigate
risks with respect to commodities or currencies to which the Borrower or any
Subsidiary has actual exposure (other than those in respect of Equity Interests
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries), and (b) Swap Agreements entered
into in order to effectively cap, collar or exchange interest rates (from fixed
to floating rates, from one floating rate to another floating rate, from
floating to fixed rate or otherwise) with respect to any interest-bearing
liability or investment of the Borrower or any Subsidiary; provided, that in the
event that the Total Leverage Ratio exceeds 2.00 to 1.0 at any date of
determination, then if on such date less than 30% of the funded Indebtedness of
Borrower as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower for the
most recent ended fiscal quarter accrues interest at a fixed rate of interest,
the Borrower shall promptly enter into Swap Agreements, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to the extent necessary so
that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have consolidated floating rate interest
exposure in respect of not more than 70% of its consolidated funded
Indebtedness.

      SECTION 6.06 Restricted Payments. (a) The Borrower will not, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, declare or make, or agree to pay or make,
directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, except, following the
consummation of the Church's Disposition, (i) the Borrower may declare or pay
cash dividends with the proceeds of the Church's Disposition in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $163,500,000 (the "Dividend Amount"); provided, however,
that to the extent the Church's Gross Proceeds is less than $390,000,000, the
Dividend Amount shall be reduced by a like amount on a dollar for dollar basis,
(ii) to the extent the Borrower reduces the LC Exposure below $8,306,330, the
Dividend Amount shall be increased by a like amount on a dollar for dollar basis
in an amount not to exceed $8,306,330 (the "LC Exposure Reduction Amount") and
(iii) to the extent that the Revolving Credit

                                      F-60
<PAGE>

Exposure exceeds $24,706,330 on the Closing Date, the Dividend Amount shall be
decreased by a like amount on a dollar for dollar basis. With respect to clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) above, at the time of any such declaration of payment no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. The Borrower shall
provide the Administrative Agent a certificate, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, with respect to clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) above as to the change in the Dividend Amount and the Church's Gross
Proceeds in reasonable detail.

            (b) The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any
Subsidiary to, make or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any payment
or other distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) of or in
respect of principal of or interest on any subordinated Indebtedness, or any
payment or other distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property),
including any sinking fund or similar deposit, on account of the purchase,
redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any
Indebtedness, except (i) payment or prepayment of Indebtedness created or
permitted under the Loan Documents and (ii) the scheduled interest payments on
Subordinated Debt permitted pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof and only to the extent required thereby; provided that at the time
of any payment of such restricted payment pursuant to this clause (ii) and
immediately after giving effect thereto, (A) no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing under Section 7(a), or (B) no Event of Default shall
have occurred under Section 7(e) and Section 7(f), provided further that before
prohibiting payment for such Event of Default under Section 7(e) and Section
7(f), Administrative Agent shall have given the notice required under the
Subordinated Debt indenture of its election to block such payments, subject to
the subordination provisions of the permitted Subordinated Debt.

      SECTION 6.07 Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrower will not, and will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or otherwise transfer any
property or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any property or
assets from, or otherwise engage in any other transactions with, any of its
Affiliates, except (a) in the ordinary course of business at prices and on terms
and conditions not less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary than could
be obtained on an arm's-length basis from unrelated third parties, (b)
transactions between or among the Borrower and its wholly owned Subsidiaries or
between wholly owned Subsidiaries not involving any other non-Affiliate and
between Borrower and other non-wholly owned Subsidiaries on a commercially
reasonable basis, (c) any Restricted Payment permitted by Section 6.06, (d)
reasonable and customary compensation or employee benefit arrangements with any
officer or member of the Board of Directors of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices, (e) the Employee Tax Loan Notes, and (f) employee stock purchase
plans.

      SECTION 6.08 Restrictive Agreements. The Borrower will not, will not
permit Subsidiary Loan Parties to and will use reasonable commercial efforts to
prohibit any of its Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Loan Parties to,
directly or indirectly, enter into, incur or permit to exist any agreement or
other arrangement that prohibits, restricts or imposes any condition upon (a)
the ability of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to create, incur or permit to
exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets, or (b) the ability of any
Subsidiary to pay dividends or other distributions with respect to any shares of
its Capital Stock or to make or repay loans or advances to the Borrower or any
other Subsidiary or to Guarantee Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other
Subsidiary; provided that (i) the foregoing shall not apply to restrictions and
conditions imposed by law or by this Agreement, (ii) the foregoing shall not
apply to restrictions and conditions existing on the date hereof identified on
Schedule 6.08 (but shall apply to any extension or renewal of, or any amendment
or modification expanding the scope of, any such restriction or condition),
(iii) the foregoing shall not apply to customary restrictions and conditions
contained in agreements relating to the sale of a Subsidiary pending such sale,
provided such restrictions and conditions apply only to the Subsidiary that is
to be sold and such sale is permitted hereunder, (iv) clause (a) of the
foregoing shall not apply to restrictions or conditions imposed by any agreement
relating to secured Indebtedness permitted by this Agreement if such
restrictions or conditions apply only to the

                                      F-61
<PAGE>

property or assets securing such Indebtedness and are no more restrictive in any
material respect than these provisions and (v) clause (a) of the foregoing shall
not apply to customary provisions in contracts and leases entered into in the
ordinary course restricting the assignment thereof.

      SECTION 6.09 Sale and Leaseback Transactions. The Borrower will not, and
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any arrangement (other
than with or between Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries), directly or
indirectly, whereby it shall sell or transfer any property, real or personal,
used or useful in its business, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, and
thereafter rent or lease such property or other property that it intends to use
for substantially the same purpose or purposes as the property sold or
transferred, except for Permitted Sale Leasebacks and other sale leasebacks to
the extent such other sale leasebacks and other Indebtedness permitted under
Section 6.01(q) do not exceed $30,000,000 and in no event shall such other sale
leasebacks exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate, it being understood that any
such Permitted Sale Leaseback or other sale leaseback shall constitute a
Prepayment Event.

      SECTION 6.10 Capital Expenditure. (a) The Borrower will not permit the
aggregate amount of Consolidated Capital Expenditures made by the Borrower and
the Subsidiaries in any fiscal year to exceed the corresponding amount set forth

      SECTION 6.11 Amendment of Material Documents. The Borrower will not, nor
will it permit any Subsidiary Loan Party to, amend, modify or waive any of its
rights under (a) its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents if such amendment, modification or waiver would
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Lenders or (b) any
indenture, credit agreement or other document entered into to evidence or govern
the terms of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(h) if the
effect of such amendment, modification or waiver is to increase the interest
rate on the Indebtedness, change (to earlier dates) any dates upon which
payments of principal or interest are due thereon, change any event of default
or condition to an event of default (other than to delay, waive or eliminate any
such event of default), change the redemption, prepayment or defeasance
provisions thereof, change the subordination provisions thereof (or of any
guaranty thereof), or if the effect of such amendment or change, together with
all other amendments or changes made, is to increase materially the obligations
of the obligor thereunder or to confer any additional rights on the holders of
the Indebtedness (or a trustee or other representative on their behalf) which
would be adverse to Borrower or Lenders.

      SECTION 6.12 Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. As of the last day of
any fiscal quarter the Borrower will not permit the ratio of (i) Consolidated
EBITDAR less Taxes (excluding taxes associated with the Church's Disposition)

pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any shares of Capital Stock or other

qualify directors if required by applicable law.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                Events of Default

            If any of the following events ("Events of Default") shall occur:

            (a) the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or any
      reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement when and as the
      same shall become due and payable, whether at the due date thereof or at a
      date fixed for prepayment thereof or otherwise;

            (b) the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or any
      fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in clause (a) of
      this Article) payable under this Agreement, when and as the same shall
      become due and payable, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a
      period of three Business Days;

            (c) [Reserved];

            (d) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on
      behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in or in connection with this
      Agreement or any amendment or modification hereof or waiver hereunder, or
      in any report, certificate, financial statement or other document
      furnished pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or any
      amendment or modification hereof or waiver hereunder, shall prove to have
      been materially incorrect when made or deemed made;

            (e) the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any covenant,
      condition or agreement contained in Section 5.02, 5.03 (with respect to

      the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement;

            (f) the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party shall fail to observe

<PAGE>

      clause (a), (b), (d) or (e) of this Article) or in any of the Security
      Documents (other than with respect to Collateral with an aggregate fair
      market value of which does not exceed $1,000,000), and such failure shall
      continue unremedied for a period of thirty days after notice thereof from
      the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which notice will be given at
      the request of any Lender);

            (g) the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall fail to make any payment
      (whether of principal or interest and regardless of amount) in respect of
      any Material Indebtedness, when and as the same shall become due and
      payable and such failure continues beyond applicable cure periods;

            (h) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
      Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables
      or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
      both) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or
      agent on its or their behalf to cause any Material Indebtedness to become
      due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance
      thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity; provided that this clause (h)
      shall not apply to secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of
      the voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such
      Indebtedness;

            (i) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary
      petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other
      relief in respect of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or its debts, or of a
      substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state or foreign
      bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in
      effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,
      sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Borrower or any
      Material Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any
      such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed for 60
      days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing
      shall be entered;

            (j) the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall (i) voluntarily

      of a petition filed against it in any such proceeding, (v) make a general
      assignment for the benefit of creditors or (vi) take any action for the
      purpose of effecting any of the foregoing;

            (k) the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall become unable,
      admit in writing its inability or fail generally to pay its debts as they
      become due;

            (l) any money judgments, writ or warrant of attachment or similar
      process which is beyond all rights of appeal involving (i) in any
      individual case an amount in excess of $2,500,000 or (ii) in the aggregate
      at any time an amount in excess of $5,000,000 (in either case not
      adequately covered by insurance as to which a solvent and unaffiliated
      insurance company has acknowledged coverage) shall be rendered against the
      Borrower, any Subsidiary or any combination thereof and the same shall
      remain undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which
      execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally
      taken by a judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of the
      Borrower or any Subsidiary to enforce any such judgment;

            (m) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the
      Required Lenders,

                                      F-64
<PAGE>

      when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, could
      reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

            (n) a Change in Control shall occur;

            (o) any Lien purported to be created under any Security Document
      shall cease to be, or shall be asserted by any Loan Party not to be, a
      valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral having an aggregate fair market
      value of $1,000,000 or more, with the priority required by the applicable
      Security Document, except (i) as a result of the sale or other disposition
      of the applicable Collateral in a transaction permitted under the Loan
      Documents or (ii) as a result of the Administrative Agent's failure to
      maintain possession of any stock certificates, promissory notes or other
      instruments delivered to it under any Security Document;

            (p) at any time after the execution and delivery thereof, (i) the
      Collateral Agreement for any reason, other than the satisfaction in full
      of all Obligations and termination of the Commitments, shall cease to be
      in full force and effect (other than in accordance with its terms) or
      shall be declared to be null and void or any Subsidiary Loan Party shall
      repudiate its obligations thereunder, (ii) this Agreement or any Security
      Document ceases to be in full force and effect (other than by reason of a
      release of Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof or
      the satisfaction in full of the Obligations in accordance with the terms
      hereof) or shall be declared null and void (other than with respect to
      Collateral with an aggregate fair market value of which does not exceed
      $1,000,000) or (iii) any Loan Party shall contest the validity or
      enforceability of any Loan Document in writing or deny in writing that it
      has any further liability, including with respect to future advances by
      Lenders, under any Loan Document to which it is a party;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (i) or (j) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the
request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or
both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of this
Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and
other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph, if at any time
within 60 days after an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to such paragraph
Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all payments on account of
principal which shall have become due otherwise than as a result of such
acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent permitted by law, on
overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement) and all Events of
Default (other than non-payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the
Loans, in each case which is due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration)
shall be remedied or waived, then Required Lenders, by written notice to
Borrower, may at their option rescind and annul such acceleration and its
consequences; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereon. The provisions of this paragraph are
intended

                                      F-65
<PAGE>
      merely to bind Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of
      Required Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not grant
      Borrower the right to require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration
      hereunder or preclude Lenders from exercising any of their rights and
      remedies under the Loan Documents, even if the conditions set forth herein
      are met.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

            SECTION 8.01 General.

            Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
      the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
      Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as
      are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together
      with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

            Each Lender hereby further authorizes Collateral Agent to enter into
      each Security Document as secured party on behalf of and for the benefit
      of Lenders and agrees to be bound by the terms of each Security Document;
      provided that Collateral Agent shall not enter into or consent to any
      amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision contained
      in any Security Document without the prior consent of Required Lenders;
      provided further, however, that, without further written consent or
      authorization from Lenders, Collateral Agent may execute any documents or
      instruments necessary to effect the release of any asset constituting
      Collateral from the Lien of the applicable Security Document in the event
      that such asset is sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction effected
      in accordance with Sections 6.03 or 6.04 (and shall, at the reasonable
      request of Borrower execute such documents and instruments).

            The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have
      the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
      and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent,
      and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
      and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any
      Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative
      Agent hereunder.

            The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
      except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality
      of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any
      fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
      occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have
      any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
      powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated
      hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as
      directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
      the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
      Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
      Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
      liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the
      Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by
      the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any
      capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action
      taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
      Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
      shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or
      in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
      Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default
      unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative
      Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not
      be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any
      statement, warranty or representation

                                      F-66
<PAGE>

      made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any
      certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection
      herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
      agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the
      validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement
      or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of
      any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
      confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
      Administrative Agent.

            The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
      not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
      certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
      believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper
      Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to
      it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper
      Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
      Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel
      for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by
      it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
      accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

            The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
      exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
      appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any
      such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights
      and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
      provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent
      and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
      sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
      with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well
      as activities as Administrative Agent.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
      Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative
      Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
      and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
      have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.
      If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and
      shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
      Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
      Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank,
      appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an
      office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
      acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
      successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
      rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
      Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
      duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a
      successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
      predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
      successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
      provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for
      the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and
      their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
      omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative
      Agent.

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
      reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
      such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
      credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
      also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
      the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
      and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue
      to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
      upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished
      hereunder or thereunder. Each Lender further acknowledges that each of
      J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston shall have no
      obligations under this Agreement.

            (a) Within sixty (60) days following the Initial Effective Date, the
      Borrower shall establish with the Administrative Agent (i) an account (the
      "Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account") in the name of the Administrative
      Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders), into which the Borrower may from
      time to time deposit Dollars pursuant to, and in accordance with Sections
      2.10(c) and 2.10(f) hereof. The Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account
      shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent
      and shall be subject to a control agreement entered into between the
      Borrower and the Administrative Agent. In the case of funds deposited in
      the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account (i) in accordance with Section
      2.10(c), unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, the
      Administrative Agent will release such funds as set forth in Section
      2.10(c) and (ii) in accordance with Section 2.10(f), the Administrative
      Agent will apply such funds as set forth in Section 2.10(f).

            (b) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed to
      invest and reinvest the funds from time to time deposited into the
      Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, so long as no Event of Default has
      occurred and is continuing, on the instructions of the Borrower (provided,
      that any such instructions given verbally shall be confirmed promptly in
      writing) or, if the Borrower shall fail to give such instructions upon
      delivery of any such funds, in the sole discretion of the Administrative
      Agent; provided, that in no event may the Borrower give instructions to
      the Administrative Agent to, or may the Administrative Agent in its
      discretion, invest or reinvest funds in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral
      Account in anything other than Cash Equivalents.

            (c) Any net income or gain on the investment of funds from time to
      time held in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, shall be promptly
      reinvested by the Administrative Agent as a part of the Breakage Cost Cash
      Collateral Account; and any net loss on any such investment shall be
      charged against the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account.

            (d) The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any of the Lenders
      shall not be a trustee for any of the Loan Parties, or shall have any
      obligations or responsibilities, or shall be liable for anything done or
      not done, in connection with the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account,
      except as expressly provided herein and except that the Administrative
      Agent shall have the obligations of a secured party under the Uniform
      Commercial Code. None of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
      of the Lenders shall have any obligation or responsibility or shall be
      liable in any way for any investment decision made in accordance with this
      Section 8.02 or for any decrease in the value of the investments held in
      the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account.

            (e) Grant of Security Interest. For value received and to induce the
      Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit and the Lenders to enter into this
      Agreement, as security for the payment of all of the Obligations, each of
      the Loan Parties hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent (for the
      benefit of the Lenders) and grants to the Administrative Agent (for the
      benefit of the Lenders), a first priority Lien upon all of such Loan
      Party's rights in and to the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, all
      cash, documents, instruments and securities from time to time held
      therein, and all rights pertaining to investments of funds in the Breakage
      Cost Cash Collateral Account and all products and proceeds of any of the
      foregoing. All Cash, documents, instruments and securities from time to
      time on deposit in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account, and all
      rights pertaining to investments of funds in the Breakage Cost Cash
      Collateral Account shall immediately and without any need for any further
      action on the part of any of the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent or
      any of the Lenders, become subject to the Lien set forth in this

                                      F-68

      Section, be deemed Collateral for all purposes hereof and be subject to
      the provisions of this Credit Agreement.

            (f) Remedies. At any time during the continuation of an Event of
      Default, the Administrative Agent may sell any documents, instruments and
      securities held in the Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account and may
      immediately apply the proceeds thereof and any other cash held in the
      Breakage Cost Cash Collateral Account in accordance with Section 2.10.

      approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall

      or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other

<PAGE>

            (h) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for
      notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
      hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in

      SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that
they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
      amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
      writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the
      Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required
      Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment
      or Applicable Percentage of any Lender without the written consent of such
      Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or
      reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
      without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii)
      postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan
      or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
      hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
      postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the
      written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.10
      or Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
      sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each
      Lender affected thereby, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section
      or the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" or any
      other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage
      of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify
      any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
      thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of
      such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release any Subsidiary Loan Party
      from its Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except as expressly
      provided in the Collateral Agreement), or limit its liability in respect
      of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii)
      release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the
      Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii)
      change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms
      adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding
      Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other
      Class, without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in
      interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each adversely
      affected Class (in addition to any consent required under any other clause
      of this Section), (ix) change the rights of the Tranche B Term Loan
      Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in Section 2.10,
      without the written consent of Tranche B Term Loan Lenders holding a
      majority of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loans; provided further that no
      such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
      duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
      Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative
      Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,

                                      F-70

      as the case may be.

      SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower shall
pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation,
execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection
with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of
its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of
Credit.

            (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
      Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
      foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
      and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
      damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and
      disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted
      against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
      of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or
      instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of
      their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
      Agreement or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or
      Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any
      refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter
      of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not
      strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any
      presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned
      or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
      Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its
      Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
      investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether
      based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any
      Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as
      to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
      damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
      competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
      resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
      Indemnitee.

            (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
      to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
      Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
      severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
      the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable
      Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
      expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided
      that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
      liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
      asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
      Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.

            (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall
      not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
      theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
      damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
      connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or
      instrument contemplated

                                      F-71
<PAGE>

      hereby, the Agreement, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
      proceeds thereof.

            (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
      after written demand therefor.

      SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of
the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment
or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and
(ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations
hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
(including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit),
Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to
the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
      below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
      its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
      portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the
      prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

            (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved
Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, any other assignee; and

            (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the
Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is
a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund immediately prior to
giving effect to such assignment.

      (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

            (C) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of
a Lender or an Approved Fund, or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of
the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment
and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 for the Revolving Loan
Facility or $1,000,000 for the Term Loan facilities unless each of the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of
the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Article VII has
occurred and is continuing;

            (D) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, provided that this Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B) shall not be construed
to prohibit assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;

            (E) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500;

            (F) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an

                                      F-72
<PAGE>

Administrative Questionnaire; and

            (G) in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a CLO (as defined
below) managed by such Lender or by an Affiliate of such Lender, unless such
assignment (or an assignment to a CLO managed by the same manager or an
Affiliate of such manager) shall have have been approved by the Company (the
Company hereby agreeing that such approval, if requested will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), the assigning Lender shall retain the sole
right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, provided that the Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and
such CLO may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of such CLO,
agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
Section 9.02(b) that affects such CLO.

            For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the terms "Approved Fund"
and "CLO" have the following meanings:

            "Approved Fund" means (a) with respect to any Lender, a CLO managed
by such Lender or by an Affiliate of such Lender and (b) with respect to any
Lender that is a fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of
credit, any other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of
credit and is managed by the same investment advisor as such Lender or by an
Affiliate of such investment advisor.

            "CLO" means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing
in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and is administered or managed by a Lender or an Affiliate of such
Lender.

      (ii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph
      (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
      each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
      hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
      Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
      Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
      interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
      obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
      Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
      under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
      shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17
      and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
      under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be
      treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
      participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph
      (c) of this Section.

      (iii) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the
      Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment
      and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
      names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
      amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to
      the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the
      Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
      the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
      recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
      hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to
      the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
      Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at

                                      F-73
<PAGE>

      any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

      (iv) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
      executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
      Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
      Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in
      paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
      required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall
      accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained
      therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of
      this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in
      this paragraph.

            (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
      Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
      participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
      all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this
      Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
      owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this
      Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
      responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
      obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
      Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
      such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
      this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender
      sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
      sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
      modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
      such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,
      without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
      modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b)
      that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
      Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
      the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it
      were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
      paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
      Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as
      though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
      Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

      (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
      under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been
      entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
      Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
      made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would
      be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
      benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the
      participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for
      the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it
      were a Lender.

            (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or
      Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
      all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
      obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or
      assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this
      Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security
      interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
      interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
      substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

      SECTION 9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to

                                      F-74
<PAGE>

this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any
fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid
or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and
Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

      SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

      SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

      SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

      SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of New York.

            (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
      itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
      Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
      United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
      appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out
      of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any
      judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
      unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such

                                      F-75
<PAGE>

      action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State
      or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the
      parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
      proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
      by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in
      this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the
      Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
      proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its
      properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
      the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
      which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
      action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
      court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties
      hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
      the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
      proceeding in any such court.

            (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
      process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in
      this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
      serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

      SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

      SECTION 9.11 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

      SECTION 9.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors who have a legitimate need to know
such information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to
the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than

                                      F-76
<PAGE>

the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all
information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by
the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the
Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the
time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

      SECTION 9.13 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

      SECTION 9.14 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot Act"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the
Patriot Act.

      SECTION 9.15 Reaffirmation and Grant of Security Interests. (a) Each Loan
Party has (i) guarantied the Obligations and (ii) created Liens in favor of
Lenders on certain Collateral to secure its obligations hereunder, under the
Guarantee. Each Loan Party hereby acknowledges that it has reviewed the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and consents to the amendment and restatement
of the Existing Credit Agreement effected pursuant to this Agreement. Each Loan
Party hereby (i) confirms that each Loan Document to which it is a party or is
otherwise bound and all Collateral encumbered thereby will continue to guarantee
or secure, as the case may be, to the fullest extent possible in accordance with
the Loan Documents, the payment and performance of the Obligations and all
Guarantee, as the case may be, including without limitation the payment and
performance of all such Obligations and all Guarantee which are joint and
several obligations of each grantor now or hereafter existing, and (ii) grants
to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a continuing lien on
and security interest in and to such Loan Party's right, title and interest in,
to and under all Collateral as collateral security for the prompt payment and
performance in full when due of the Obligations and all Guarantee (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise).

            (b) Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that any of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party or otherwise bound shall continue in full force
and effect and that all of its obligations thereunder shall be valid and
enforceable and shall not be impaired or limited by the execution or
effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement.
Each Loan Party represents and warrants that all representations and warranties
contained in the Loan Documents to which it is a party or otherwise bound are
true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of the Closing
Date to the same extent as though made on and as of that date, except to the
extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier
date, in which case they were true, correct

                                      F-77
<PAGE>

and complete in all material respects on and as of such earlier date.

      SECTION 9.16 Amendment and Restatement. It is the intention of each of the
parties hereto that the Existing Credit Agreement be amended and restated so as
to preserve the perfection and priority of all security interests securing
indebtedness and obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement and that all
Indebtedness and Obligations and Guarantee of Borrower and its Subsidiaries
hereunder and thereunder shall be secured by the Security Documents and that
this Agreement does not constitute a novation of the obligations and liabilities
existing under the Existing Credit Agreements. The parties hereto further
acknowledge and agree that this Agreement constitutes an amendment of the
Existing Credit Agreement made under and in accordance with the terms of
subsection 9.02 of the Existing Credit Agreement. In addition, unless
specifically amended hereby, each of the Loan Documents, the Exhibits and
Schedules to the Existing Credit Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect and that, from and after the Closing Date, all references to the "Credit
Agreement" contained therein shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement.
