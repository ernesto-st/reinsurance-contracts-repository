Cedent for, one hundred percent (100%) of all Reinsured Liabilities, net of
collectible reinsurance from Unaffiliated Reinsurers. The Reinsurer shall follow

Agreement caused by the failure of Reinsurer to perform its obligations as
Administrator under RIC (Landmark) Administrative Services Agreement.

Cedent, all reinsurance under this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance
Agreement shall be payable by Reinsurer on the basis of the liability of Cedent
under the Reinsured Contracts without diminution because of the insolvency of
Cedent. In the event of insolvency and the appointment of a conservator,
liquidator or statutory successor of Cedent, all amounts payable by Reinsurer
hereunder to Cedent shall be payable directly to Cedent or to such conservator,
liquidator or statutory successor.

                  Section 8.2 Notice of Pendency of Claim. It is understood,

receiver or statutory successor of Cedent shall give written notice to Reinsurer
of the pendency of a claim against Cedent on the Reinsured Contracts reinsured
hereunder within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the insolvency
proceeding and during the pendency of such claim. Reinsurer may investigate such
claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is
to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to Cedent
or its liquidator or receiver or statutory successor. It is further understood
that the expense thus incurred by Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to
court approval, against Cedent as part of the expense of liquidation to the
extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Cedent as a
result of the defense undertaken by Reinsurer.

                  Section 8.3 Notice of Insolvency. If either Cedent or
Reinsurer becomes insolvent, such party shall notify the other party of the
insolvency within five (5) Business Days thereof.

         sixty (60) days from the date of issuance.

                  (b)      In the event that this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share
Reinsurance Agreement is terminated under Section 9.2(a)(ii), Reinsurer shall

                               REINSURANCE CREDIT

                  Section 12.1 Reinsurance Credit. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement to the

in order for Cedent to obtain full credit on its statutory quarterly and annual
statements filed with such jurisdiction for the reinsurance being provided under

                                       11
<PAGE>

agreement meeting the requirements of New York Regulation 114 and/or a

                                   ARBITRATION

                  Section 13.1 Arbitration. As a condition precedent to any
cause of action, any and all disputes between Cedent and Reinsurer arising out
of, relating to, or concerning this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance
Agreement, whether sounding in contract or tort and whether arising during or
after termination of this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement,
including whether the dispute is subject to arbitration, shall be submitted to
the decision of a board of arbitration composed of two arbitrators and an umpire
("Board") meeting at a site in Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitration shall be
conducted under the Federal Arbitration Act and shall proceed as set forth
below.

                  Section 13.2 Notice of Arbitration. A notice requesting
arbitration, or any other notice made in connection therewith, shall be in
writing and shall be sent certified or registered mail, return receipt requested
to the affected parties. The notice requesting arbitration shall state in
particulars all issues to be resolved in the view of the claimant, shall appoint
the arbitrator selected by the claimant and shall set a tentative date for the
hearing, which date shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days and no later than
one hundred fifty (150) days from the date that the notice requesting
arbitration is mailed. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of claimant's notice,
the respondent shall notify claimant of any additional issues to be resolved in
the arbitration and of the name of its appointed arbitrator.

                  Section 13.3 Arbitration Panel. Unless otherwise mutually
agreed, the members of the Board shall be impartial and disinterested and shall
be active or former executive officers of property-casualty insurance companies,
reinsurance companies, or Lloyd's Underwriters or active or inactive lawyers
with at least twenty (20) years of experience in insurance and reinsurance.
Cedent and Reinsurer shall each appoint an arbitrator and the two (2)
arbitrators shall choose an umpire before instituting the hearing. If the
respondent fails to appoint its arbitrator within thirty (30) days after having
received claimant's written request for arbitration, the claimant is authorized
to and shall appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to agree
upon the appointment of an umpire within thirty (30) days after notification of
the appointment of the second arbitrator, within ten (10) days thereof, the two
(2) arbitrators shall request the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") to
appoint an umpire for the arbitration with the

                                       12
<PAGE>

qualifications set forth in this Article. If the AAA fails to name an umpire,
either party may apply to the court named below to appoint an umpire with the
above required qualifications. The umpire shall promptly notify in writing all
parties to the arbitration of his selection and of the scheduled date for the
hearing. Upon resignation or death of any member of the Board, a replacement
shall be appointed in the same fashion as the resigning or deceased member was
appointed.

                  Section 13.4 Submission of Briefs. The claimant and respondent
shall each submit initial briefs to the Board outlining the issues in dispute
and the basis, authority and reasons for their respective positions within
thirty (30) days of the date of notice of appointment of the umpire. The
claimant and the respondent may submit reply briefs to the Board within ten (10)
days after filing of the initial brief(s). Initial and reply briefs may be
amended by the submitting party at any time, but not later than ten (10) days
prior to the date of commencement of the arbitration hearing. Reasonable
responses shall be allowed at the arbitration hearing to new material contained
in any amendments filed to the briefs but not previously responded to.

                  Section 13.5 Arbitration Board's Decision. The Board shall
make a decision and award with regard to the terms of this RIC (Landmark) Quota
Share Reinsurance Agreement and the original intentions of the parties to the
extent reasonably ascertainable. The Board's decision and award shall be in
writing and shall state the factual and legal basis for the decision and award.
The decision and award shall be based upon a hearing in which evidence shall be
allowed and which the formal rules of evidence shall not strictly apply but in
which cross examination and rebuttal shall be allowed. At its own election or at
the request of the Board, either party may submit a post-hearing brief for
consideration of the Board within twenty (20) days of the close of the hearing.
The Board shall make its decision and award within thirty (30) days following
the close of the hearing or the submission of post-hearing briefs, whichever is
later, unless the parties consent to an extension. Every decision by the Board
shall be by a majority of the members of the Board and each decision and award
by the majority of the members of the Board shall be final and binding upon all
parties to the proceeding.

                  Section 13.6 Jurisdiction. Either party may apply to the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware for an order compelling arbitration or
confirming any decision and the award; a judgment of that Court shall thereupon
be entered on any decision or award. If such an order is issued, the attorneys'
fees of the party so applying and court costs will be paid by the party against
whom confirmation is sought. The Board may award interest calculated from the
date the Board determines that any amounts due the prevailing party should have
been paid to the prevailing party.

                  Section 13.7 Expenses. Each party shall bear the expense of
the one arbitrator appointed by it and shall jointly and equally bear with the
other party the expense of any stenographer requested, and of the umpire.

                                       13
<PAGE>

                  Section 13.8 Production of Documents and Witnesses. Subject to
customary and recognized legal rules of privilege, each party participating in
the arbitration shall have the obligation to produce those documents and as
witnesses to the arbitration those of its employees as any other participating
party reasonably requests providing always that the same witnesses and documents
be obtainable and relevant to the issues before the arbitration and not be
unduly burdensome or excessive. The parties may mutually agree as to pre-hearing
discovery prior to the arbitration hearing and in the absence of agreement, upon
the request of any party, pre-hearing discovery may be conducted as the Board
shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest of fairness, full
disclosure, and a prompt hearing, decision and award by the Board. The Board
shall be the final judge of the procedures of the Board, the conduct of the
arbitration, of the rules of evidence, the rules of privilege and production and
of excessiveness and relevancy of any witnesses and documents upon the petition
of any participating party. To the extent permitted by law, the Board shall have
the authority to issue subpoenas and other orders to enforce their decisions.

                  Section 13.9 Relief Available. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent any participating party from applying to the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware to issue a restraining order or other equitable relief
to maintain the "status quo" of the parties participating in the arbitration
pending the decision and award by the Board or to prevent any party from
incurring irreparable harm or damage at any time prior to the decision and award
of the Board. The Board shall also have the authority to issue interim decisions
or awards in the interest of fairness, full disclosure, and a prompt and orderly
hearing and decision and award by the Board.

                  Section 13.10 Consolidation. In the event that there is a
dispute between the Cedent and Reinsurer which implicates the provisions of this
RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement and the RIC (Landmark)
Administrative Services Agreement, Cedent and Reinsurer hereby agree to
consolidate any such dispute under such agreements in a single arbitration
proceeding.

                  Section 14.1 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. This RIC
(Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement may not be amended, modified or
waived except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed and delivered on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privileged. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

                  Section 14.2 Entire Agreement. This RIC (Landmark) Quota Share

or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

                  Section 14.3 Governing Law. This RIC (Landmark) Quota Share
Reinsurance Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

                  Section 14.4 Severability. Any term or provision of this RIC
(Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this RIC (Landmark) Quota
Share Reinsurance Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any
of the terms or provisions of this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this RIC (Landmark)
Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.

                  Section 14.5 Counterparts. This RIC (Landmark) Quota Share
Reinsurance Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware for the purposes
of enforcing this Quota Share Agreement or the RIC (Landmark) Administrative
Services Agreement. If any action is brought in a state court, the parties shall
take such actions as are within their control to cause any matter contemplated
hereby to be assigned to the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. In any
action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise any claims that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above
courts, that such action or suit is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the
venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper. Each of the parties
hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party
hereto in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding shall be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the
United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall
be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

                  Section 14.7 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the
provisions of Article XI, nothing in this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person,
other than the parties hereto

                                       15

sublicensed or transferred by any party to this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share

agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this RIC (Landmark) Quota
Share Reinsurance Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would
be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
each party agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies, each other
party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any of the provisions of this RIC (Landmark) Quota Share
Reinsurance Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of
security pending the outcome of any arbitration. In the event that any action
should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this RIC
(Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement, no party will allege, and each
party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
