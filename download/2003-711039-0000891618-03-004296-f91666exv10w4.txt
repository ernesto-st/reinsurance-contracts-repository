      SECOND AMENDMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of August 7, 2003 (the "Second

defined herein shall have the meanings attributed thereto in the RLSA.

      WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed to amend the RLSA on the terms and

            (a) The RLSA is hereby amended by adding the following definitions
to Section 1.01 thereof (in the correct alphabetical order):

            "Adjusted Yield Rate" means with respect to any Fixed Period for any
      Loan allocated to such Fixed Period, an interest rate per annum equal to
      the Stressed Eurodollar Rate; provided, however, that if the Lender shall
      have notified the Agent that a Eurodollar Disruption Event has occurred,
      the Adjusted Yield Rate shall be equal to the Stressed Base Rate until the
      Lender has notified the Agent that such Eurodollar Disruption Event has
      ceased, at which time the Adjusted Yield Rate shall again be equal to the
      Stressed Eurodollar Rate.

            "Material Amendment" means a material amendment to this Agreement
      which would have a material, adverse effect upon the interests of the
      Lender, the Facility Insurer or the Agent.

      Loan allocated to such Fixed Period, an interest rate per annum equal to
      the sum of (i) the Applicable Margin in effect during such Fixed Period
      (or if more than one Applicable Margin was in effect during such Fixed
      Period, the average of the Applicable Margins in effect on each day during
      such Fixed Period) plus (ii) an amount equal to 1.5 multiplied by the
      average of the Base Rates in effect on each day during such Fixed Period.

            "Stressed Eurodollar Rate" means with respect to any Fixed Period
      for any Loan allocated to such Fixed Period, an interest rate per annum
      equal to the sum of (i) the Applicable Margin in effect during such Fixed

      Fixed Period, the average of the Applicable Margins in effect on each day
      during such Fixed Period) plus (ii) an amount equal to 1.5 multiplied by
      the Eurodollar Rate for such Fixed Period.

      recent consecutive Cut-Off Dates and (ii) the highest average of the
      Sales-Based Default Ratios as of any three consecutive Cut-Off Dates
      occurring during the previous twelve Fiscal Months;

                  LH = the Loss Horizon, which shall be equal to the cumulative
      Sales during the previous 90 days divided by the Net Eligible Receivables
      Balance as of the most recent Cut-Off Date; and

                  SF = the Stress Factor, which shall be 2.

thereof the following:

            "Earned Discount Rate" means, as of any date of determination, a

      defined in the Premium Letter) and (iii) at any time after an Early

      any time prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Default and the appointment
      of the Backup Servicer as Servicer hereunder, the Servicing Fee Rate, (C)

      or as should have been calculated in, the most recent Monthly Remittance
      Report required to have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.11(b) hereof.

            (k) Section 2.05(c) of the RLSA is hereby amended by deleting clause
