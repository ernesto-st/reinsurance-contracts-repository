3       RETROCESSION

3.1      XL Re agrees to retrocede and the Retrocessionaire agrees to accept the
         Business Covered with effect from the Effective Date according to the
         terms of this Agreement.

3.2      The Retrocessionaire hereby agrees to be liable according to the terms
         of this Agreement and will follow the fortunes and settlements of XL Re
         in respect of the Business Covered, except that:

3.2.1     The Retrocessionaire does not indemnify and shall not be liable for
          any extracontractual damages or liability of any kind whatsoever of XL
          Re's resulting from, but not limited to: negligent, reckless or
          intentional wrongs; fraud; oppression; bad faith; or strict liability.

3.2.2     XL Re will advise the Retrocessionaire of its intention to contest,
          compromise, or litigate benefit payments involving annuities reinsured
          hereunder. The Retrocessionaire may pay its Retrocessionaire's Share
          of the Unusual Expenses of such contests, in addition to its share of
          benefit payments, or it may choose not to participate. Unusual
          Expenses exclude routine investigative and administrative expenses,
          including salaries of home office personnel and interpleader expenses.
          If the Retrocessionaire chooses not to participate, it will discharge
          its liability by payment to XL Re of the full amount of its liability,
          prior to any contests, on the annuity reinsured hereunder. Any
          decision by the Retrocessionaire not to participate must be
          communicated to XL Re within 60 days after receipt from XL Re of their
          advice to contest, compromise, or litigate benefit payments hereunder.

3.3      The Retrocessionaire's liability in respect of the Business Covered
         will commence on the Effective Date and liability will cease as
         contemplated in clause 10.1.

3.4      The reinsurance of the Business Covered, as contemplated in clause 3.1,
         is a retrocession of a closed book and is limited solely to the
         Business Covered as defined in this Agreement and shall not apply to
         any other business of XL Re.

3.5      After taking into account all retrocession agreements for the Business
         Covered, XL Re agrees to retain a proportion of the liability of no
         less than the Minimum Retention.

4       ASSETS

4.1      XL Re will maintain a segregated portfolio of Assets in accordance with
         the provisions of the Security Agreement throughout the duration of
         this Agreement.

4.2      All Assets and any Investment Income arising on those Assets will
         remain with XL Re throughout the duration of this Agreement. The Assets
         will be managed in accordance with the Statement of Investment Policy
         Guidelines and Objectives as shown in Schedule 3 to this Agreement, as
         amended from time to time.

4.3      The Retrocessionaire shall be credited with the Retrocessionaire's
         Share of the Investment Income arising from the Assets.

                                                                               6

<PAGE>

4.4      The Retrocessionaire shall be debited with the Retrocessionaire's Share
         of the Benefit Payments, Investment Expenses, Administration Expense
         Allowances, and Custody Expense Allowances at each Pre-Payment Date.

4.5      The Retrocessionaire shall pay to XL Re the Retrocessionaire's Share of
         any Further Capital Requirement as defined in Clause 5.3.

4.6      The Retrocessionaire shall be paid the Retrocessionaire's Share of any
         Distributable Surplus as defined in Clause 5.4.

5       ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS

5.1      At each and every Pre-Payment Date, XL Re's Appointed Actuary will
         conduct an Actuarial Valuation of the Business Covered in accordance
         with the provisions of the Security Agreement.

5.2      The value of the Liability Outgo shall be compared with the value of
         the Assets at the relevant Pre-Payment Date to determine the extent of
         any Surplus, if the value of the Assets exceeds the value of the
         Liability Outgo, or, a Further Capital Requirement, if the value of the
         Liability Outgo exceeds the value of the Assets.

5.3      Should there be a Further Capital Requirement at any Pre-Payment Date
         then the Retrocessionaire will be required to make a payment to XL Re
         at the Further Capital Payment Date to meet the Retrocessionaire's
         Share of the Further Capital Requirement.

5.4      Should there be a Surplus at any Pre-Payment Date then part or all of
         the Surplus may be declared as a Distributable Surplus and released
         From the Assets. The amount of the Distributable Surplus will be
         determined at the sole discretion of XL Re's Appointed Actuary save
         that, should the Surplus exceed the Maximum Surplus, then the
         Distributable Surplus will be no less than the amount by which the
         Surplus exceeds the Maximum Surplus. The Retrocessionaire will receive
         the Retrocessionaire's Share of the Distributable Surplus at the
         Distributable Surplus Date.

         the amount of Assets by the Initial Capital Requirement.

         Capital Requirement is due from the Retrocessionaire and payable to XL
         Re.

7       ADMINISTRATION

7.1      XL Re shall on the completion of each Actuarial Valuation prepare and
         deliver an Account in such format as the Retrocessionaire may
         reasonably require. If the Retrocessionaire disagrees with the Account
         prepared, such dispute shall be resolved mutatis mutandis in accordance
         with the provisions of clause 11.

                                                                               7

<PAGE>

7.2      Responsibility for the costs associated with the administration of the
         Business Covered rests solely with XL Re. This includes, but is not
         restricted to, maintaining appropriate records, verifying that benefits
         are being paid in accordance with the Reinsurance Agreement and the
         provision of information to the Retrocessionaire in accordance with
         clause 7.1 and/or clause 8, as the case may be.

7.3      All payments made by XL Re are binding on the Retrocessionaire,
         provided any such payments are in respect of the Business Covered and
         are made strictly in accordance with the relevant terms of the
         Reinsurance Agreement and do not violate the terms of this Agreement.

7.4      All payments due to or from the Retrocessionaire will be settled in
         cash in GBP and transferred, by means of electronic funds transfer.

8       INFORMATION

8.1      XL Re shall, upon request from the Retrocessionaire from time to time,
         provide the Retrocessionaire with such information during normal
         business hours in respect of the Business Covered as the
         Retrocessionaire may reasonably request and in such format as the
         Retrocessionaire may reasonably require.

8.2      Except as may be impermissible at law, the Retrocessionaire may appoint
         representatives to inspect, during normal business hours, any relevant
         information under clause 7.1 or this clause 8 and such representatives
         may make copies (at the cost of the Retrocessionaire) of any such
         relevant documents and information, including without limitation any
         such information stored on any computer or in any other electronic
         form.

9       LATE PAYMENT INTEREST

         Any amounts due by either XL Re or the Retrocessionaire under this
         Agreement, which are outstanding after the due date for payment
         thereof, will bear interest at the Late Payment Interest Rate from the

         interest shall be capitalised monthly in arrears.

         the Parties shall use their reasonable endeavours to reach agreement on
         the continuance of this Agreement on whatever basis or the basis upon
         which the retrocession arrangement contemplated by this Agreement will
         be terminated. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement within 30
         Business Days of the date upon which this Agreement becomes prohibited
         or rendered impossible, such dispute shall be determined, mutatis
         mutandis, in accordance with clause 11.

         creditors generally or making an application to a court of competent
         jurisdiction for protection from its creditors generally, upon which
         event the provisions of clause 10.4 shall apply hereto.

10.4     If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of
         clause 10.3 the Retrocessionaire's liability under this Agreement in
         respect of the Business Covered shall be calculated pro rata up to and
         including the date of termination.

11.4     If the respective Appointed Actuaries of XL Re and the Retrocessionaire
         are unable to reach agreement within the time period contemplated in
         clause 11.3, XL Re and the Retrocessionaire shall agree upon an
         independent actuary. If XL Re and the Retrocessionaire are unable to
         reach agreement on the identity of the independent actuary within a
         period of 10 Business Days of expiry of the period referred to in
         clause 113, such independent actuary shall be appointed by the
         President, for the time being, of the Institute of Actuaries in England
         and Wales.

11.5     XL Re and the Retrocessionaire shall make all reasonable endeavours to
         procure that the independent actuary performs the disputed calculation
         within 15 Business Days of his appointment. Any calculation undertaken
         by the independent actuary shall be in his capacity as an expert and
         not as an arbitrator or quasi-arbitrator and his decision shall be
         final and binding on XL Re and the Retrocessionaire.

                                                                               9

11.6     All other disputes and differences between the Reinsurer and the
         Retrocessionaire on which an agreement cannot be reached will be
         decided by arbitration, regardless of the insolvency of either party,
         unless the conservator, receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor is
         specifically exempted from an arbitration proceeding by the Governing
         Law in accordance with clause 13. Either party may initiate arbitration
         by providing written notification to the other party. Such written
         notice shall contain a brief statement of the issue(s), the failure on
         behalf of the parties to reach amicable agreement and the date of
         demand for arbitration. The arbitrators will regard this Agreement from
         the standpoint of practical business and equitable principles rather
         than that of strict law. The arbitrators shall be solely responsible
         for determining what shall be considered and what procedure they deem
         appropriate and necessary in the gathering of such facts or data to
         decide such dispute. Both parties agree that the decision of the
         arbitrators is final and binding and that no appeal shall be made from
         that decision. Should either party fail to comply with the decision of
         the arbitrators, the other party shall have the right to seek and
         receive the assistance of an appropriate court to enforce the decision
         of the arbitrators. The costs of the arbitration are to be borne
         equally by both parties unless the arbitrators decide otherwise.

11.7     An arbitration panel consisting of three arbitrators will be formed in
         accordance with the provisions of clauses 11.7.1 to 11.7.3 and from
         that point on all other matters whether procedural or factual will be
         decided solely at the discretion of the arbitration panel. Members of
         the arbitration panel must be, or have been, officers of life insurance
         or reinsurance companies other than the two parties to this Agreement
         or any company owned by, or affiliated with, either party.

11.7.1    One of the arbitrators is to be appointed by XL Re, another by the
          Retrocessionaire, and they shall select a third before arbitration
          begins. The arbitrators picked by the parties shall be contacted by
          the party that so chose the arbitrator. They may share the notice of
          arbitration letter, this clause of this Agreement and briefly explain
          the nature of the dispute, such as the types of policies involved and
          the reinsurance issues in dispute, so that the candidate may make an
          informed decision as to his/her technical qualifications to serve, but
          no more than that. They should in no way be "canvassing" the candidate
          for his/her sympathies with their side of the dispute, nor take any
          action that would compromise the candidate's impartiality. Should one
          party fail to comply with the notice to arbitrate and fail to select
          an arbitrator within the time allotted below, the other party shall
          have the right to appoint such arbitrator on their behalf. The
          appointments shall be made in the following manner: the Reinsurer and
          the Retrocessionaire shall each present an initial list of five
          prospective arbitrators to the other party within 25 calendar days of
          the postmark on the mailing of the notification initiating the
          arbitration. The Reinsurer and the Retrocessionaire shall select one
          arbitrator each from the list supplied by the other party. Should the
          selected arbitrator decline to serve, another name shall be selected
          from the respective list the entire process of selection of the first
          two arbitrators shall be accomplished within 45 calendar days of the
          postmark on the mailing of the notification initiating the
          arbitration. The party who initiated the list will submit as many
          additional names within 5 calendar days, as necessary, so that at all
          times there will be a pool of five names from which the other party
          may make its selection.

                                                                              10

<PAGE>

11.7.2   The two arbitrators, once selected, shall then select the third
         arbitrator from the remaining eight names on the two lists within 20
         calendar days of the second arbitrator's date of appointment. Should
         the two arbitrators be unable to agree on a choice for the third
         arbitrator, the remaining eight names shall be placed in a pool and the
         final arbitrator shall be drawn at random from such pool by the two
         arbitrators within 5 additional calendar days from the expiry of the
         date such third arbitrator should have been appointed. If the
         prospective arbitrator so chosen shall decline to serve as the third
         arbitrator, another prospective arbitrator shall be randomly selected
         until the original pool is exhausted. The parties shall continue to
         replace the pool within 5 calendar days from the date the last name is
         exhausted, with an additional eight names until an arbitrator is found.

11.7.3   Once the panel is selected, the party initiating the arbitration will
         submit in writing it's understanding of the dispute and the outstanding
         issues surrounding such dispute, their attempt(s) to rectify such
         dispute, and their proposed solution to settle the dispute within 20
         calendar days after the final arbitration panel member has been
         selected. The other party shall be provided with a copy of this initial
         statement and shall respond in writing with it's understanding of the
         dispute within 30 calendar days after the final arbitration panel
         member has been selected.

         clause 9 and/or clause 12, as the case may be.

11.3     All payments made by the Cedant are binding on XL Mid Ocean, provided
         any such payment is in respect of the Business Covered and are made
         strictly in accordance with the relevant terms applicable to any Policy
         and in accordance with the Policy Conditions and do not violate the
         terms of this Agreement.

11.4     On each and every Pre-Payment Date, the Pre-Payment Due will be settled
         in cash in GBP and transferred, by means of electronic funds transfer,
         into (or out of in the case of negative amounts) the Pre-Payment Fund.

11.5     [***]

11.6     The Cedant undertakes to use all reasonable efforts to ensure that it
         is advised of the death of any Annuitant and shall, in any event,
         inform XL Mid Ocean on the first Business Day of the month following
         each calendar quarter after the date of signature of this Agreement of
         the death of an Annuitant since the last such advice. The Cedant will
         include an adjustment in respect of any overpaid Pre-Payments Due made
         by XL Mid Ocean in the next available Account, together with interest
         at the Interest Rate.

11.7     No ex-gratia or compromise payment made by the Cedant (and no payment
         above the binding award limit of an Insurance Ombudsman or his
         equivalent) will be binding on XL Mid Ocean unless XL Mid Ocean gives
         its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld.

11.8     In addition to clause 11.7, if an annuity payment is proposed on an
         ex-gratia or compromise basis to an Annuitant, XL Mid Ocean will not be
         liable for that payment, unless the Cedant gives XL Mid Ocean all
         information known to it regarding any such payment and continues to
         keep XL Mid Ocean fully informed, to the extent reasonably practicable,
         of all developments relating to the payment as soon as is practicably
         possible.

2.1      The Chargor shall discharge each of the Obligations in the manner

         and pay to the Secured Party when due and payable and in the manner
         provided for in the Reinsurance Agreement and this Security Agreement
         each sum owing by the Chargor to the Secured Party in respect of the
         Obligations.

2.2      On the Deferred Premium Payment Date, the Chargor shall transfer to the
         Accounts, Permitted Collateral, having an aggregate Value at least
         equal to the Required Amount.

2.3      The Chargor charges with full title guarantee and by way of first fixed
         charge all of the Collateral the balance from time to time of the
         Pre-Payment Fund and all of its rights under the Custodian Agreement
         (insofar as the same relate to the Collateral) in favour of the Secured
         Party as security for the payment and discharge of all of the
         Obligations.

2.4      The Chargor shall deliver a notice to (and use its reasonable
         endeavours to procure acknowledgement from) the Custodian and any other
         relevant person under the Custodian Agreement and each relevant Deposit
         Taker of the security interest over each of the Accounts and (as the
         context requires) the Pre-Payment Fund, in the form set out in Annex 1.

2.5      The Chargor hereby agrees that the security provided by the terms of
         the covenant and charge in this Security Agreement shall be a
         continuing security for each of its Obligations and shall not be
         satisfied by any intermediate payment or satisfaction of the whole of
         any part of the Obligations.

2.6      The Chargor hereby waives any right it may have of first requiring the
         Secured Party to proceed against or claim payment from any other person
         or enforce any guarantee or security before enforcing this Security
         Agreement.

2.7      Where any discharge (whether in respect of the security constituted by
         this Security Agreement, any other security or otherwise) is made on
         the faith of any payment, security or other disposition which is
         avoided or any amount paid pursuant to any such discharge or
         arrangement must be repaid on bankruptcy or liquidation (or otherwise)
         of the Chargor, the security constituted by this Security Agreement and
         the liability of the Chargor under this Security Agreement shall
         continue as if there had been no such discharge or arrangement.

  3      DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND IMPROVED COLLATERAL

3.1      If a Call Amount exists on a Valuation Date, the Chargor shall by 12
         p.m. London time on the second Banking Day following such Valuation
         Date, at the cost and expense of the Chargor,

                                        4

<PAGE>

         arrange for the delivery to the Accounts of further Permitted
         Collateral with a Value as at the relevant Valuation Date of not less
         than the Call Amount (and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
         subject to the charge in clause 2 of this Agreement).

  3.2    If the Collateral (including, without limitation, the Pre-payment Fund)
         has, on any day (the "Relevant Day"), an average Standard & Poor's
         rating of below A (such rating to be of (i) the relevant asset(s) in
         respect of Non-Cash Assets and (ii) the Custodian and Deposit Taker(s)
         in respect of Cash), the Chargor shall (notwithstanding that the Call
         Amount is equal to or less than zero on the Relevant Day) deliver
         Permitted Collateral to the Account. Such Permitted Collateral shall be
         delivered on the second Banking Day following the Relevant Day and
         shall ensure that the average Standard & Poor's rating of the
         Collateral (including, without limitation, the Pre-payment Fund) after
         delivery is equal to or greater than A. If a Return Amount exists after
         such delivery, the provisions of clause 4 shall apply.

    4    RETURN OF COLLATERAL

  4.1    If a Return Amount exists on a Valuation Date, the Chargor may at any
         time, by giving written notice (a "REQUEST FOR RETURN") to the Secured
         Party and the Custodian, require the Secured Party to comply with the
         provisions of clause 4.2 or 4.3.

  4.2    If a Return Amount exists on a Valuation Date, and the Secured Party
         receives a Request for Return, by 10 a.m. London time, the Secured
         Party shall, by 12 p.m., London time, on the second Banking Day
         following the date of receipt of the Request for Return, at the cost
         and expense of the Chargor, arrange with the Custodian for the
         redelivery of a portion of the Collateral having a Value as at the
         relevant Valuation Date, equal to the Return Amount (rounded pursuant
         to clause 5.2) to the Chargor, whereupon that portion of the Collateral
         shall be released from the security interest constituted by this
         Security Agreement.

  4.3    If a Return Amount exists on a Valuation Date, and the Secured Party
         receives a Request for Return after 10 a.m. London time, the Secured
         Party shall by close of business on the third Banking Day following the
         date of receipt of the Request for Return at the cost and expense of
         the Chargor, arrange with the Custodian for the redelivery of a portion
         of the Collateral having a Value as at the relevant Valuation Date,
         equal to the Return Amount (rounded pursuant to clause 5.2) to the
         Chargor, whereupon that portion of the Collateral shall be released
         from the security interest constituted by this Security Agreement.

  4.4    When all Obligations have been paid, discharged and performed in full,
         the Secured Party will, upon the request and at the reasonable expense
         of the Chargor, release the security interest created pursuant to
         clause 2 and procure that the Custodian shall redeliver all Collateral
         (together with any interest each pursuant to clause 8) to the Chargor.
         Any such release shall be conditional upon no security, disposition or
         payment to the Secured Party by the Chargor being void, set aside or
         ordered to be refunded pursuant to any law relating to insolvency or
         for any other reason whatsoever and, if such condition is not
         fulfilled, the Secured Party will be entitled to enforce this Security
         Agreement as if such release had not occurred.

  4.5    Any notice given by the Chargor in accordance with clause 4.1 shall
         specify:

4.5.1    the Value of the Collateral in the Accounts as of the close of business
         on the Banking Day immediately preceding the relevant Valuation Date;

4.5.2    the Return Amount;

4.5.3    any other information necessary for the effective redelivery of
         Collateral in accordance with clause 4.2 or 4.3; and

4.5.4    the type of Collateral the Chargor wishes to have returned (where more
         than one type of Permitted Collateral has been delivered to the
         Accounts pursuant to this Security Agreement).

                                        5

  5      ROUNDING, MINIMUM TRANSFERS AND INFORMATION

         of GBP 1,000,000.

5.2      All Return Amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest integral
         multiple of GBP 1,000,000.

5.3      The Chargor will procure that the Valuation Agent will notify each
         party within 5 Banking Days following a Valuation Date (each such day
         being a "Notification Date") of the existence of a Call Amount or a
         Return Amount (if any) as the case may be.

5.4      On each Notification Date, on the first Banking Day of each month and
         on the First Banking Day after which the aggregate market value of
         assets exchanged out of the Collateral since the last such account
         exceeds 5% of the Required Amount as at the last such account and from
         time to time at the reasonable request of the Secured Party, the
         Chargor will provide to the Secured Party an account detailing all
         Collateral then held in the Accounts in a form and content
         substantially similar to the list of Agreed Assets as set out in
         Schedule A to the Reinsurance Agreement (but including, in addition,
         the market value of those assets) and such other details as may be
         agreed between the parties from time to time. Where the Secured Party
         requests additional information, the Chargor shall not unreasonably
         deny access to the Valuation Agent if the Secured Party so requests the
         Valuation Agent to provide such information.

5.5      At the reasonable request of the Secured Party and at reasonable
         intervals, the Chargor will provide to the Secured Party evidence in a
         form satisfactory to the Secured Party, that the Collateral is not
         subject to any Encumbrance other than the charge hereby created.

         the Collateral and replace such Non-Cash Collateral with Cash
         Collateral or Non-Cash Collateral of equal Value provided only that
         such sale or disposal is carried out on a delivery against payment
         basis, save in the case of any Currency Hedge Assets where payment is
         not made against delivery but is due in accordance with the terms of
         such Currency Hedge Asset

         In the event that the Chargor shall appoint a new Custodian, or in
         event that the Chargor becomes aware of the appointment of any new

         appointment to the Secured Party as soon as is reasonably practicable
         thereafter.

  8      DISPUTE RESOLUTION

8.1      If the Secured Party or its Appointed Actuary does not approve any
         calculation performed by the Chargor or the Valuation Agent under this
         Security Agreement (or any other dispute which is to be determined in
         accordance with this clause 8) then the remaining provisions of this
         clause 8 shall apply.

8.2      If the Secured Party or its Appointed Actuary does not approve any one
         or more of the calculations performed by the Chargor or the Valuation
         Agent, the Secured Party shall deliver a notice in writing to the
         Chargor, specifying the calculation of which it does not approve and
         setting out in reasonable detail, the basis of the objection. Where a
         dispute is required to be determined elsewhere in this Security

8.3      The Chargor and the Secured Party shall, within ten (10) Banking Days
         of delivery of the notice referred to in clause 8.2 attempt, in good
         faith, to resolve the dispute.

8.4      If the Chargor and the Secured Party are unable to resolve the dispute
         within the time period contemplated in clause 8.3, such dispute shall
         be referred to the respective Appointed Actuaries of the Chargor and
         the Secured Party, who shall further attempt to resolve the dispute
         amicably within ten (10) Banking Days of expiry of the period referred
         to in clause 8.3.

8.5      If the respective Appointed Actuaries of the Chargor and the Secured
         Party are unable to reach agreement within the time period contemplated
         in clause 8.4, the Chargor and the Secured Party shall agree upon an
         independent actuary. If the Chargor and the Secured Party are unable to
         reach agreement on the identity of the independent actuary within a
         period of ten (10) Banking Days of expiry of the period referred to in
         clause 8.4, such independent actuary shall be appointed by the
         President, for the time being, of the Institute of Actuaries in England
         and Wales.

8.6      The Chargor and the Secured Party shall use all reasonable endeavours
         to procure that the independent actuary perform the disputed
         calculation within fifteen (15) Banking Days of his appointment. Any
         calculation undertaken by the independent actuary shall be in his
         capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator or quasi-arbitrator and
         his decision shall be final and binding on the Chargor and the Secured
         Party.

8.7      In the event that any of the matters contemplated in clauses 3.1 or 4.1
         becomes the subject matter of a dispute to be determined in accordance
         with the provisions of this clause 8, and as a result thereof, the
         Chargor or the Secured Party (as the case may be) shall not be able to
         make payment of a Call Amount or a Return Amount within the period
         required after the relevant Valuation Date, the Valuation Date shall be
         the date upon which the dispute is settled or determined (as the case
         may be) in accordance with this clause 8.

  9      POWER OF SALE

9.1      If at any time an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Secured Party shall be entitled, without prior notice to the Chargor or
         prior authorisation from any court, to sell or otherwise dispose of in
         any manner permitted by law, all or any part of the Collateral. The
         Secured Party shall be entitled to apply the proceeds of such sale or
         other disposal in paying the costs of that sale or disposal and in or
         towards the discharge of the Obligations. The Secured Party shall be
         entitled to treat any Cash Collateral as if it were the proceeds of
         such sale or other disposal.

9.2      The power of sale or other disposal in clause 9.1 shall operate as a
         variation and extension of the statutory power of sale under s101 of
         the Law of Property Act 1925 and the Secured Party may exercise any
         power available to it by virtue of this Security Agreement or
         available to a secured creditor. The restrictions contained in s93 and
         s103 of the Law of Property Act 1925 shall not apply to this Security
         Agreement or to any exercise by the Secured Party of its right to
         consolidate mortgages or its power of sale.

9.3      In favour of a purchaser of all or any part of the Collateral, a
         certificate in writing by an officer, attorney or agent of the Secured
         Party that any power of sale or other disposal has arisen and is
         exercisable shall be conclusive evidence of that fact and no purchaser
         shall be concerned to enquire whether any power exercised or purported
         to be exercised by the Secured Party has become exercisable or whether
         any Obligation remains due.

 10      APPLICATION OF CASH COLLATERAL

         In respect of Cash Collateral, the Secured Party may at any time after
         an Event of Default with respect to the Chargor has occurred and is
         continuing, without prior notice to the Chargor, apply or appropriate
         the Cash Collateral in or towards the payment or discharge of any
         amounts payable by the Chargor with respect to any Obligation in such
         order as the Secured Party sees fit; or set off all or any part of any
         amount payable by the Chargor with respect to any Obligation against
         any obligation of the Secured Party to repay any amount to the Chargor
         in respect of

                                       7

<PAGE>

         the Permitted Collateral; and for these purposes the Secured Party
         shall be entitled to make any currency conversions or effect any
         transaction in currencies which it thinks fit and to do so at such
         times and rates as it thinks proper.

    11   FURTHER ASSURANCE

         On demand by the Secured Party, the Chargor shall promptly upon notice
         from the Secured Party execute all documents and do or procure all
         things (including the delivery, transfer, assignment or payment of all
         or part of the Collateral to the Custodian or Sub-Custodian on behalf
         of the Secured Party) that the Secured Party may reasonably specify for
         the purpose of (a) exercising the Collateral Rights when the relevant
         Collateral Rights become exercisable or (b) securing and perfecting its
         security over or title to all or any part of the Collateral or (c)
         enabling the Secured Party to vest all or part of the Collateral in its
         name or in the name(s) of its nominee(s), agent or any purchaser when
         the Collateral Rights become exercisable.

    12   POWER OF ATTORNEY

         The Chargor, by way of security, irrevocably appoints the Secured Party
         as its attorney and in its name, on its behalf and as its attorney to
         execute, deliver and perfect all documents and do all things in the
         name of the Chargor or the Secured Party (as the attorney may decide)
         that the Secured Party may consider to be requisite for (a) carrying
         out any obligation imposed on the Chargor under this Security Agreement
         or (b) exercising any of the Collateral Rights. The Chargor shall
         ratify and confirm all things done and all documents executed by the
         Secured Party in the exercise of that power of attorney.

    13   RECEIVER

  13.1   If at any time, an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Secured Party may by writing (acting through an authorised officer of
         the Secured Party) without notice to the Chargor appoint one or more
         persons to be receiver of the whole or any part of the Collateral (each
         such person being (a) entitled to act individually as well as jointly
         and (b) for all purposes deemed to be the agent of the Chargor).

  13.2   In addition to the powers of the Secured Party conferred by clause 13,
         each person appointed pursuant to clause 13.1 shall have, in relation
         to the part of the Collateral in respect of which he is appointed, all
         the powers (as varied and extended by the provisions hereof) conferred
         by the lnsolvency Act 1986 and the Law of Property Act 1925 on
         mortgagors and mortgagees in possession, administrators, receivers and
         administrative receivers appointed under those Acts (whether or not
         such person is such).

    14   EFFECTIVENESS OF COLLATERAL

  14.1   The collateral constituted by this Security Agreement and the
         Collateral Rights shall be cumulative, in addition to and independent
         of every other security which the Secured Party may at any time hold
         for the Obligations or any rights, powers and remedies provided by law.
         No prior security held by the Secured Party over the whole or any part
         of the Collateral shall merge into the Collateral hereby constituted.

  14.2   This Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as a
         continuing arrangement:

14.2.1   unless and until the Secured Party discharges it; or

14.2.2   unless terminated by agreement between the parties.

  14.3   No failure on the part of the Secured Party to exercise, or delay on
         its part in exercising, any Collateral Right shall operate as a waiver
         thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of a Collateral Right
         preclude any further or other exercise of that or any other Collateral
         Right. The obligations of the Chargor under this Security Agreement
         shall not be affected by any act,

                                        8

<PAGE>

         omission or circumstance which, but for this provision, might operate
         to release or otherwise exonerate the Chargor from its obligations
         hereunder.

  14.4   If, at any time, any provision of this Security Agreement is or becomes
         illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any
         jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the
         remaining provisions of this Security Agreement nor of such provision
         under the law of any other jurisdiction shall in any way be affected or
         impaired thereby.

  14.5   In relation to any share in a company which is for the time being part
         of the Collateral, the rights attached to such share shall be
         exercisable by the Secured Party only for the purpose of preserving the
         value of such share or of realising it, and unless there is an Event of
         Default with respect to the Chargor, shall be exercisable only in
         accordance with the Chargor's instructions or otherwise in its
         interests.

    15   SUBSEQUENT INTERESTS AND ACCOUNTS

  15.1   If the Secured Party at any time receives notice of any subsequent
         mortgage, assignment, charge or other interest affecting all or any
         part of the Collateral, all payments which would otherwise have been
         made by the Chargor to an Account shall thereafter be treated as having
         been credited to a new account of the Chargor and not as having been
         applied in reduction of the Obligations as at the time when the
         Secured Party received notice.

  15.2   All monies received, recovered or realised by the Secured Party under
         this Security Agreement (including the proceeds of any conversion of
         currency) may in its discretion be credited to and held in any suspense
         or impersonal account pending their application from time to time in or
         towards the discharge of any of the Obligations.

         encumbrance or security interest of any kind, or another type of

         than the security interest created under this Security Agreement; and

16.1.5   it is not unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s123 of the

         permitted or required to be done by it under this Security Agreement
         and the assets of the Chargor are now and will remain immediately after
         the date hereof greater than its liabilities (taking into account the
         actuarial value of its contingent and prospective liabilities) for the
         purposes of s123(2) and s241 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

         Collateral transferred to the Secured Party shall be paid by the
         Chargor, and any failure on the part of the Chargor to make such
         payment will result in the Secured Party having the right to elect to
         make such payment on behalf of the Chargor and demand immediate
         repayment by the Chargor of such payment to itself (and such payment
         shall be so repayable by the Chargor), provided that (for so long as
         the value of the Collateral is equal to or greater than the Required
         Amount), the Secured Party, by written notice to the Chargor, has given
         the Chargor a reasonable period of time to discharge any such calls or
         other payments.

19.2     At any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default and without any

                            GUIDELINES AND OBJECTIVES
                         Sterling Fixed income Portfolio

         A.       INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

                  The basic objective is to attain the highest total return
                  consistent with a reasonable degree of risk by investing in
                  fixed income securities. Success in achieving that objective
                  will be measured by comparing the risk and after-fee return of
                  the Portfolio to a custom index consisting of: 81% MERRILL
                  LYNCH STERLING NON-GILTS INDEX, 10+ YEARS, 9% MERRILL LYNCH
                  STERLING NON-GILTS INDEX, 1-10 YEARS AND 10% MERRILL LYNCH UK
                  ALL GILTS INDEX (THE "BENCHMARK INDEX").

                  WESTERN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY LIMITED (hereinafter the
                  "Investment Manager") and XL MID OCEAN REINSURANCE LTD
                  (hereinafter the "Client") will review the appropriateness of
                  the benchmark annually against the liability profile.

         B.       STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

                  The purpose of these Guidelines is to:

                  -        Establish the investment objective and performance
                           standards of the Portfolio;

                  -        Ensure that the Investment Manager has the capability
                           to evaluate the risks of all financial instruments in
                           which the Portfolio is invested;

                  -        Prevent the Investment Manager from exposing the
                           Portfolio to excessive overall levels of risk,
                           exposure to inappropriate risk sources, or
                           disproportionate exposure to any one risk source.

         Set out reporting requirements and risk controls required by the
         Appointed Actuary to the Fund.

         C.       INVESTMENT GUIDELINES

                  The Investment Manager will manage a diversified fixed income
                  portfolio consistent with the Investment Objectives and
                  Statement of Purpose outlined above and in compliance with the
                  Guidelines stated below. Use of derivative securities in the
                  management of the Portfolio should not expose the Portfolio to
                  risks that would be considered inappropriate under these
                  Guidelines if accessed with physical securities.

                  The Guidelines are divided into two parts being those
                  associated with market driven risks and those for controlling
                  event-driven risks.

                  MARKET-DRIVEN RISKS are systematic risks that are priced more
                  or less continuously in active markets. They are defined by
                  their linkage to a single fundamental risk source that is
                  readily observed. Examples include:

                           -        Interest rate risk (level and yield curve)

                           -        Credit risk (spread to Gilts of varying
                                    credit qualities)

                           -        Sector risk (spread of various sector yields
                                    to Gilts)

                  Market-driven risks are best controlled by measuring and
                  limiting portfolio sensitivity thereto.

                  EVENT-DRIVEN RISKS are distinctive risks associated with
                  particular securities or markets. Their important features are
                  that the status of the underlying risk is not readily proxied
                  by price movements in active markets and, while the
                  probability of the event risk being realized in any period
                  tends to be low, the consequences of realization tend to be
                  large. Examples of event-driven risks include individual
                  issues downgrade/default risk, etc.

                  Event-driven risks are best controlled by diversification
                  requirements.

                                                                               1

                  1.       MARKET RISKS:

                           (a)      Sources of market risk to which portfolio
                                    exposure is appropriate are as follows:

                                    -        Level and shape of the UK yield
                                             curve

                                    -        Yield spread between Gilts and
                                             various qualities of non-government
                                             debt

                           (b)      The investment Manager at all times must be
                                    able to identify all such sources of risk to
                                    which the Portfolio in aggregate is exposed.
                                    This requirement applies to both physical
                                    and derivative securities. The purchase of
                                    securities with exposure to sources of risk
                                    other than those listed above is allowed
                                    only with the prior written consent of the
                                    Client.

                           (c)      The Investment Manager shall maintain an
                                    awareness of the range of values that can be
                                    assumed by the various sources of market
                                    risk to which the Portfolio is exposed. In
                                    addition, the Investment Manager shall
                                    maintain an awareness of the likelihood that
                                    any given source of market risk will assume
                                    a given value within a year. The range and
                                    likelihood of values described above shall
                                    be based on reasonable empirical evidence.

                           (d)      The Investment Manager shall STRESS TEST the
                                    sensitivity of the Portfolio to changes in
                                    the value of relevant risk sources across
                                    the full range of likely values the risk
                                    sources may assume. Futures, options,
                                    forward contracts and other derivative
                                    instruments will be included in this
                                    analysis of Portfolio risk exposures. The
                                    Investment Manager will manage the Portfolio
                                    so that its stress-test sensitivity to an
                                    adverse change in market conditions is
                                    expected to be no more than a 2% decline in
                                    principal value relative to the Benchmark
                                    Index over any one-year period, based on a
                                    statistical confidence of two standard
                                    deviations.

                           (e)      On a prospective basis, the Investment
                                    Manager will manage the TRACKING ERROR of
                                    the Portfolio with respect to the Benchmark
                                    Index. The tracking error of the Portfolio
                                    is the annualized standard deviation of the
                                    difference between the returns of the
                                    Portfolio and the returns of the Benchmark
                                    Index. The prospective annualized tracking
                                    error for the Portfolio should not exceed
                                    100 basis points, based on a statistical
                                    confidence of one standard deviation.

                           (f)      The Investment Manager will ensure that the
                                    Client's Portfolio shall be invested at all
                                    times such that, under the Actuarial
                                    Resilience Test (as advised by the Appointed
                                    Actuary), the excess of the Portfolio value
                                    over the Liabilities will exceed L2.5
                                    million.

                  The maximum effective duration of the Portfolio will never be
                  more than +/-5% of the effective duration of the Benchmark
                  Index.

                  Procedures for demonstrating compliance with these market risk
                  guidelines will be established in cooperation with the Client.

                  2.       EVENT-DRIVEN RISKS:

                  The following guidelines relate to diversification standards
                  to control event-driven risks such as default and counter
                  party risks.

                           (a)      ELIGIBLE SECURITIES

                           The Investment Manager will have full discretion to
                           manage the Portfolio subject to the following
                           maturity, credit and diversification and
                           marketability guidelines:

                                                                               2

                           by one of the rating agencies such that a downgrade
                           would result in such counter party being rated at
                           less than single A, trading must be suspended. Prior

                           shall not exceed the amount the Investment Manager
