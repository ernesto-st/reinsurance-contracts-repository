<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the
Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a Lender as of the Closing Date or a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in New York, New York, or any other financial institution with an office in New York, New York that is engaged in the making of commercial loans and the
provision of agency services in syndicated commercial loan transactions. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that if the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such
appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1)&nbsp;the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the other Credit Documents (except that in the case of any Collateral held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring Agent shall
continue to hold such Collateral until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2)&nbsp;all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall
instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a
successor's appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable
by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Article and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Sections 13.6</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>14.8</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> shall continue in effect for the benefit of such

jurisdiction the Agent might be prohibited from exercising any of the powers, rights or remedies granted to the Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under any of the Credit Documents or from holding
title to or a Lien upon any Collateral or from taking any other action which may be necessary hereunder or under any of the Credit Documents, the Agent may appoint an additional Person or Persons as a
separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent which is not so prohibited from taking any of such actions or exercising any of such powers, rights or remedies. If the Agent shall appoint
an additional Person as a separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent as provided above, each and every remedy, power, right, claim, demand or cause of action intended by this
Agreement and any of the Credit Documents and every remedy, power, right, claim, demand or cause of action intended by this Agreement and any of the Credit Documents to be exercised by or vested in or

separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent to exercise such powers, rights and remedies, and every covenant and obligation necessary to the exercise thereof by such separate
collateral agent or co-collateral agent shall run to and be enforceable by any of them. Should any instrument from the Lenders be required by the separate collateral agent or

in and confirm to him or it such rights, powers, duties and obligations, any and all of such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Lenders whether or not a
Default or Event of Default then exists. In case any separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent, or a successor to either, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, all the estates, properties, rights, power, duties and obligations of such separate collateral agent or co-collateral agent, so far as permitted by applicable law, shall vest in
