Agreements in any material respect at or prior to Closing, said failure would
have a Material Adverse Effect, and said failure is not cured within five
(5)&nbsp;Business Days following notice to Seller from Buyer identifying said
failure (or, in the case of a failure under any of the Lexford Property Agreements,
if said failure is not cured within any applicable cure period under said
Lexford Property Agreement) then an &#147;Event of Seller&#146;s Default&#148; shall be deemed
to have occurred under this Agreement.&#160;
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

which expressly survive termination, (ii)&nbsp;upon notice to Seller not more
than ten (10)&nbsp;days after the expiration of any such cure period, and
provided an action is filed within thirty (30) days </font>following the scheduled Closing Date, Buyer
may seek specific performance of this Agreement, but not damages (except that
damages shall be a remedy available to Buyer if and to the extent the remedy of
specific performance is unavailable to Buyer as a matter of law or equity due
to the Interest itself being a general intangible and not real property) or
(iii) waive said Event of Seller&#146;s Default and proceed to Closing.&#160; Seller agrees and acknowledges that due to
the limitations on Buyer&#146;s recovery of damages as provided herein, Buyer does
not have an adequate remedy at law, and therefore specific performance is an
appropriate remedy for an Event of Seller&#146;s Default.&#160; Buyer&#146;s failure to seek specific performance
as aforesaid shall constitute its election to proceed under
clause&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;above.&#160; If Buyer
elects to proceed under said clause&nbsp;(i), Seller shall be obligated,
promptly on demand from Buyer, to deliver any directions to Escrowee necessary
or desirable to cause Escrowee to deliver the Earnest Money to Dreier LLP in
trust for Buyer and Buyer&#146;s Affiliates, which obligation shall be enforceable
by injunction, declaratory judgment or other equitable relief.&#160; Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that
all Buyer Parties shall be required to elect the same remedy (i.e., either
termination, with return of the applicable earnest money plus interest, waiver
or specific performance and related relief) under this Agreement as under all
of the Lexford Property Agreements, and that Buyer may not pursue specific
performance under this Agreement unless all Buyer Parties are closing or
pursuing specific performance under the Lexford Property Agreements, or
terminate this Agreement unless all Buyer Parties are concurrently terminating
the Lexford Property Agreements.&#160;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall limit any
indemnification obligation of ERP and Seller under this Agreement and the
Indemnification Agreement.&#160; In the event
that pursuant to Section 8.1 above Buyer is not obligated to close hereunder,
then Buyer at its option shall have the remedy described in clause (i) above
unless the reason that Buyer is not so obligated is due to a Seller&#146;s Event of
Default, in which case Buyer shall be entitled to elect the remedy described in

Default are impractical to ascertain and the amount of the Earnest Money under

the failure to consummate the transactions under this Agreement and shall be

Agreement shall be null and void and neither party shall have any rights or obligations
