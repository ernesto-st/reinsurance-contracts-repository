and the General Agent have entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement dated as of April 1, 2020 (the &quot;Reinsurance Agreement&quot;),
which is incorporated herein by this reference, which Reinsurance Agreement requires the appointment of the General Agent to perform
certain specified acts on behalf of the Company and Reinsurer. The General Agent desires to perform the functions and duties necessary
under the Reinsurance Agreement. It is therefore mutually agreed by the parties that the General Agent will perform all functions
necessary for the production, service and management of policies issued under the Reinsurance Agreement in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth therein and herein. To the extent that there is any conflict between the terms of this Agreement
and the Reinsurance Agreement, the Reinsurance Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained
elsewhere herein or in any other document, it is expressly understood that the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Company's performance hereunder shall not under any circumstances be interpreted to affect, weaken or modify the Reinsurer's obligation
to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against the business, credit and insurance risks as set forth in the Reinsurance
Agreement. The contractual assumption by the Reinsurer of these risks in the Reinsurance Agreement is a condition precedent to
the Company's entering into this Agreement with the General Agent.</P>

Company, at the direction of the Reinsurer, hereby appoints the General Agent as its general agent for the purpose of producing
and handling the business which is the subject of the Reinsurance Agreement issued or renewed on or after the effective date of
this Agreement. The Company, at the request of the Reinsurer, hereby grants authority to the General Agent to solicit, accept and
receive applications for such classes of coverage as are specified in the Reinsurance Agreement; to secure, at its own expense,
reasonable underwriting information through reporting agencies or other appropriate sources relating to each risk insured; to issue,
renew and countersign policies, certificates, endorsements and binders which the Company may, from time to time, authorize to be
issued, delivered, renewed and countersigned; and to collect and receipt for the premiums thereon and therefor.</P>

included in the Company's rate manuals, rate brochures and rate schedules.</P>

Company, at the Reinsurer's request, further authorizes the General Agent to perform all acts and duties under policies of insurance
issued by the Company as would otherwise be performed by the Company, including, but not limited to, properly sending and/or receiving
reports and notices and remitting and/or receiving monies due from or to the Company, and adjusting and paying losses or other
claims. The Company grants to the General Agent the authority to settle claims on behalf of the Company. However, the maximum dollar
amount of such authority per claim shall not exceed the greater of [***]% of the Company&rsquo;s policyholder surplus as of December
31 of the last completed calendar year or $[***]. For claims settlement in excess of the greater of [***]% of the Company&rsquo;s
policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the last completed calendar year or $[***], the General Agent may only settle such claims
with prior approval of the Company and the Reinsurer. The Company retains final authority to determine any disputes relating to
claims settlement and setting of loss reserves. In performing each of the acts mentioned above, the General Agent shall be under
the direct supervision and control of the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer shall be solely responsible for the acts of the General
Agent. While there are acts of the General Agent which may be required by applicable law to be performed on behalf of the Company,
the Reinsurer shall remain ultimately responsible for such acts and will indemnify and hold the Company completely harmless for
any damage, cost, liability, expense and/or loss (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Company as respects such
acts of the General Agent. The General Agent must send to the Company a report, as soon as it becomes known, that a claim (i) involves
a coverage dispute; (ii) involves a demand in excess of policy limits; (iii) alleges bad faith; (iv) is open for more than six
months; or (v) alleges a violation of any applicable unfair practices and unfair competition statutes. The Company may suspend
or terminate the settlement authority of the General Agent during the pendency of any dispute regarding any event of default by
the General Agent.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">1.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
General Agent is authorized to have claims adjusted through independent claims adjusters, subject to the supervision of the Reinsurer.
The selection of independent claims adjusters shall be subject to prior written approval of the Reinsurer and Company; provided,
that each independent adjuster assigned to assess an individual claim shall not require such prior written approval. Such independent
claims adjusters are not the agents of the Company and the Company shall be held harmless and indemnified by the Reinsurer for
any liability, claim, demand, expense and/or cost of whatever kind or character as a result of, related to or connected with any
action or inaction of such claims adjusters.</P>

rentals, transportation facilities, clerk hire, solicitors' fees, postage, advertising, exchange, personal license fees, adjustment
by the General Agent of losses under policies issued by the General Agent, or any other agency expenses whatsoever. The General
Agent's sole compensation shall be the amounts payable to the General Agent in Article VIII of the Reinsurance Agreement and in

reason, of this Agreement or of the Reinsurance Agreement (excepting only the General Agent's responsibilities with regard to run-off

General Agent shall not have the power to accept or bind risk other than as set forth herein, as set forth in the Reinsurance Agreement
or as may be subsequently authorized by the Company and Reinsurer in writing. The General Agent may not bind or cede reinsurance
or retrocession on behalf of the Company, may not commit the Company to participation in insurance or reinsurance syndicates, and
may not commit the Company to a claim settlement with a reinsurer other than the Reinsurer without the prior written approval of
the Company. If such prior written approval is given, the General Agent shall forward promptly a report to the Company concerning
such transaction and/or payment. The Company hereby authorizes the General Agent to collect payments for losses and loss adjustment
expenses from a reinsurer. The General Agent shall send a report to the Company concerning such transactions promptly.</P>

of Insurance. The General Agent agrees that any producing agent receiving commission pursuant to this Agreement shall first be
duly registered by the Company, if applicable, and said appointment on file with any applicable state insurance department. The
General Agent further agrees to be responsible for the payment of any penalty assessed to the Company for any violation by the
General Agent or any producing agent or broker registered by the General Agent pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof
of any license or appointment provision of the Texas Insurance Code or other applicable state statutes, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. If the General Agent fails to pay such penalty, the Reinsurer shall pay it immediately upon written notification

is expressly agreed and understood that all premiums collected by the General Agent are collected on behalf of the Company; that
such premiums are the property of the Company and the Reinsurer as their respective interests may appear pursuant to the Reinsurance
Agreement, less such commissions and fees as are due the General Agent as specified herein and in the Reinsurance Agreement. All
premiums collected by the General Agent on the business produced under the Reinsurance Agreement shall be deposited in a premium
trust account. Despite the General Agent&rsquo;s ownership of the account, funds deposited therein on behalf of the Company are
understood to be owned by the Company. The only disbursements from such account shall be the payment of claims, claims expenses,
return premiums, commission due the General Agent as authorized herein and in the Reinsurance Agreement, and remittance of premiums
to the Reinsurer and Company. In the event that, in the General Agent&rsquo;s reasonable opinion, the funds in the premium trust
account are not sufficient to make claim payments, the Reinsurer shall wire transfer, within five (5) working days of receipt of
a written request from the General Agent, or as soon as reasonably practicable, but always within any applicable State requirements,
into the premium trust account the funds necessary to make all then outstanding claims payments. The General Agent shall not make
personal use of any funds in this account. The commissions payable to the General Agent are debts due to the General Agent by the
Reinsurer and the privilege herein granted of deducting commissions from said premiums should not be taken as a waiver by the Company
of its exclusive ownership rights of premiums as provided herein. Should any dispute arise between the Company, the Reinsurer and/or

for commissions, to the premium trust account with full reservation of any and all rights reserved by the parties.</P>
