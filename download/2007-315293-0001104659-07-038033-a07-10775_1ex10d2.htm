PENSION AGREEMENT</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">This Supplemental
Pension Agreement<b>  </b>(&#147;Agreement&#148;) is
dated as of January 18, 2007 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;), between Aon Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and Michael D. Rice (the &#147;Executive&#148;).</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, in
recognition of the Executive&#146;s valuable long-term contributions to the Company&#146;s
growth and success, the Company wishes to provide the Executive with
supplemental pension benefit to which he is not otherwise entitled; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, in
consideration of the supplemental pension benefits the Executive desires to
abide by the terms and conditions set forth herein.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein, the parties
hereby agree as follows:</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Additional Service Credit Under
Nonqualified Pension Plan</u>.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In recognition of the Executive&#146;s
years of employment with the Ryan Insurance Group prior to the date such entity
was acquired by the Company, to the extent such years are not considered under
the Company&#146;s pension plans, the Executive shall be entitled to receive, upon
termination of the Executive&#146;s employment for any reason, a supplemental
pension benefit contingent upon the Executive&#146;s compliance with the covenants
set forth in Sections 2, 4 and 5 hereof. The supplemental pension benefit shall
be payable on a single life annuity basis at the date of termination of
employment, which will provide for the Executive aggregate pension benefits
(taking in account the offsets described in (b) below), in an annual amount
equal to the aggregate annual pension benefit to which the Executive would be
entitled under the Company&#146;s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans
as in effect on the Effective Date as if the Executive&#146;s Years of Service (as
defined in the Company&#146;s pension plan) for benefit calculation purposes is
equal to (i) 14 years plus (ii) the Executive&#146;s actual Years of Service under
the Company&#146;s pension plans.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The amount of the supplemental
pension benefit described in Section 1(a) above shall be offset by the pension
benefits provided to the Executive under any qualified or non-qualified pension
plans of the Company. The offset described in this paragraph shall be
determined on the basis of such benefits payable on a single life annuity basis
payable at the date of termination of employment.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Executive hereby elects to
receive the supplemental pension benefit in installments over a five-year
period beginning on the first day of the seventh month following the date of
termination of his employment.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If the Executive dies after the
Effective Date but before the supplemental pension benefit becomes payable, the
Executive&#146;s spouse will be entitled to receive a survivor annuity. The survivor
annuity shall be payable as of the Executive&#146;s date of death. The amount of the
survivor annuity shall be equal to the 50% joint and survivor </font></p>

spouse is entitled as if: (i) the Executive terminated employment immediately

Nonsolicitation</u>.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Recitals</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is
in the business of providing conventional and alternative risk management
products and services covering the businesses of insurance brokerage,
reinsurance brokerage, benefits consulting, compensation consulting, human
resources consulting, managing underwriting and related insurance services,
including accounting, claims management and handling, contract wording,
information systems and actuarial (the &#147;Business&#148;) as well as soliciting and
servicing the insurance and reinsurance needs of numerous commercial and
individual clients which are national and international and are not confined to
any geographic area. An essential element of the Business is the development
and maintenance of personal contacts and relationships with clients. Because of
these contacts and relationships, it is common for the Company&#146;s clients to
develop an identification with the employee who serves its insurance needs
rather than with the Company itself. The Company, however, invests considerable
time and money necessary for a relationship between its employee and a client
to develop and be maintained, in that the Company pays the employee&#146;s salary
and reimburses the employee for business expenses. The Company also assists its
employees in servicing clients by making available to these employees legal
advice, accounting support, advertising and other corporate services.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The personal
identification of clients of the Company with a Company employee creates the
potential for the employee&#146;s appropriation of the benefits of the relationships
developed with clients on behalf of and at the expense of the Company. Since
the Company would suffer irreparable harm if an employee left the Company&#146;s
employ and solicited the insurance or other related business of clients of the
Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against solicitation activities
by an employee for a limited period of time after an employee leaves the
Company so that the Company may renew or restore its business relationship with
its clients.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Company and
the Employee acknowledge and agree that the covenant contained in Sections 2(b)
and (c) below is reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and is
reasonably limited with respect to the activities it prohibits, its duration
(particularly in the context of annual and multi-year insurance renewal
periods), its geographical scope and its effect on the Employee and the public.
The parties acknowledge that the purpose and effect of the covenant simply is
to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by
the Employee.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:30.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Noncompetition</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Employee hereby covenants and agrees that, except with the prior written
consent of the Company, the Employee will not, for the longer of either two (2)
years after the end of employment, or the period during which the Company is
making Base Salary payments to the Employee pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii) of the
Employment Agreement between the parties, dated as of March 17, 2006 (the </font></p>

compete directly or indirectly in any way with the Business. For the purposes
of this Agreement, &#147;compete directly or indirectly in any way with the Business&#148;
means to enter into or attempt to enter into (on Employee&#146;s own behalf or on
behalf of any other person or entity) any business relationship of the same
type or kind as the business relationship which exists between the Company and
its clients or customers to provide services related to the Business for any
individual, partnership, corporation, association or other entity who or which
was a client or customer for whom the Employee was the producer or on whose
account Employee worked or became familiar with during the twenty-four (24)
months prior to the end of employment. &#147;Client&#148; or &#147;customer&#148; means any person
or entity listed on the books of the Company as such.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Employee
acknowledges that there is no general geographical restriction contained in the
preceding paragraph because the restriction applies only to the specified
clients and customers of the Company.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Employee from obtaining a livelihood for himself
or his family by being engaged in the insurance business. The intent of the
parties is that the restrictive covenant of non-competition by the
Employee is limited to those clients and customers of the Company, as reflected
by the books of the Company, during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the
end of the Employee&#146;s employment with the Company.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Nonsolicitation</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Employee hereby also agrees not to induce or attempt to induce, or to cause any
person or other entity to induce or attempt to induce, any person who is an
employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company during the term of
the covenant set forth herein.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <u>Exceptions</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in
this Section shall prohibit the Executive from being (i) a stockholder in a
mutual fund or a diversified investment company or (ii) a passive owner of not
more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation, any
securities of which are publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active
participation in the business of such corporation.</font></p>

time of enforcement of this Section, a court holds that the restrictions stated
herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto
agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such
circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and
that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to
cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law. This Agreement shall
not authorize a court to increase or broaden any of the restrictions in this
Section.</font></p>

Company and the Executive agree that the payments to be made, and the benefits
to be provided, by the Company to the Executive shall be made and provided in

event that the Executive shall breach any provision of Section 2, the Company

Executive shall not, at any time during the Employment Period or thereafter,
make use of or disclose, directly or indirectly, any (i) trade secret or other
confidential or secret information of the Company or of any of its
subsidiaries, or (ii) other technical, business, proprietary or financial
information of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries not available to the
public generally or to the competitors of the Company or to the competitors of
any of its subsidiaries (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;), except to the extent that
such Confidential Information (a) becomes a matter of public record or is
published in a newspaper, magazine or other periodical available to the general
public, other than as a result of any act or omission of the Executive, (b) is
required to be disclosed by any law, regulation or order of any court or
regulatory commission, department or agency, provided that the Executive gives
prompt notice of such requirement to the Company to enable the Company to seek
an appropriate protective order, or (c) is necessary to perform properly the
Executive&#146;s duties under this Agreement. Promptly following the termination of
the Employment Period, the Executive shall surrender to the Company all
records, memoranda, notes, plans, reports, computer tapes and software and
other documents and data which constitute Confidential Information which he may
then possess or have under his control (together with all copies thereof).</font></p>

Executive hereby assigns to the Company his entire right, title and interest in
and to all discoveries and improvements, patentable or otherwise, trade secrets
and ideas, writings and copyrightable material, which may be conceived by the
Executive or developed or acquired by him during the Employment Period, which
may pertain directly or indirectly to the business of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. The Executive agrees to disclose fully all such developments to
the Company upon its request, which disclosure shall be made in writing
promptly following any such request. The Executive shall, upon the Company&#146;s
request, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company all instruments and do
all other acts which are necessary or desirable to enable the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to file and prosecute applications for, and to acquire,
maintain and enforce, all patents, trademarks and copyrights in all countries.</font></p>

parties hereto agree that the Company and its subsidiaries would be damaged
irreparably in the event that any provision of Sections 2, 4 or 5 were not
performed in accordance with its terms or were otherwise breached and that
money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such nonperformance or
breach. Accordingly, the Company and its successors and permitted assigns shall
be entitled, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor,
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach or threatened breach of
any of such provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically (without
posting a bond or other security). The Executive agrees that he will submit
himself to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Illinois in
any action by the Company to enforce any provision of Sections 2, 4 or 5.</font></p>
