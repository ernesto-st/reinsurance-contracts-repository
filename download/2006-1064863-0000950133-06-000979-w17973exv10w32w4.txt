OBJECTIVE

All MCOs contracting with the State of Texas to arrange for or to provide
healthcare to enrollees in the STAR Program must submit STAR MCO FSRs for each
Service Delivery Area (SDA) in accordance with the Contract for Services between
HHSC and MCO and in accordance with the instructions below.

The MCO must also submit Delegated Network (DN) FSRs for each entity in each SDA

"global" capitation related to dental, vision, or behavioral health services.

GENERAL

All shaded data fields in the FSR represent fields where data input is required.
All data fields not shaded represents referenced data or calculations. All line
numbers in these instructions refer to the line numbers in column A on each
worksheet.

The following note is included on all FSR pages "NOTE: REPORTING IS ON AN

PART 4: TOTAL MEDICAL EXPENSES, ALL COVERAGE GROUPS COMBINED - PAGE 7

Line 1 Physician Services, Primary Care Enter all paid expenses related to the
medical care provided to a member-patient by a physician (M.D. and D.O.) upon
first contact with the health care system for treatment of an illness or injury
before referral. The PCP performs or directs the performance of primary care
services which include, but are not limited to, case management, consultations,
family planning, emergency room visits, inpatient visits, maternity care
services, office visits, preventive care services, dispensing or prescribing
medical supplies and Pharmaceuticals, authorizing referrals to specialists, etc.

Under the Texas Medicaid Managed Care Program, all members are required to have
a primary care physician (PCP) when enrolling in a MCO. For expenses to be
classified as PCP services, the performing provider at 24K on a CMS-1500 claim
must be the member-patient's assigned PCP, and the services do not represent
Deliveries - Professional Component. The total amount paid covering all charges
on a CMS-1500 claim is classified as PCP expense when the performing provider is
the member-patient's PCP.

Line 2 Physician Services, Specialist Enter all paid expenses related to the
medical care provided to a patient by a physician (M.D. and D.O.) whose practice
is limited to a particular branch of medicine or surgery, e.g., cardiology or
radiology, in which a physician specializes and/or is certified by a board of
physicians. Generally, a member-patient must have a referral authorized by
his/her assigned PCP to receive services from a specialist.

For expenses to be classified as Specialist Physician Services, the performing
provider identified at 24K on a CMS-1500 claim must be a physician who is not
the member-patient's assigned PCP, and the services do not represent Deliveries
- Professional Component. The total amount paid covering all charges on a
CMS-1500 claim is classified as Specialist Physician Services when the
performing provider is a physician who is not the member-patient's PCP.

Line 3 Physician Services, Deliveries - Professional Component Enter paid
expenses for the services of the delivering physician and the anesthesiologist,
unless they are billed as part of the facility charge. Only the delivering
physician and the anesthesiologist charges are included on Line 3, as they are
the only charges included in the professional component of the DSP. Only those
amounts paid for charges on a CMS-1500 claim identified with Delivery CPT Codes
(and the HCPCS Codes with Modifiers for the FQHCs and RHCs) are classified as
Delivery - Professional Component. All other amounts paid for charges on the
same CMS-1500 claim that are not identified with Delivery Procedure Codes are
classified as PCP or Specialist based on the criteria at Lines 1 and 2,
respectively.

therapists, social workers, speech therapists, etc.

The total amount paid covering all charges on a CMS-1500 claim is classified as
Non-Physician Professional Services when the performing provider at 24K is a
non-physician, healthcare services provider. DN FSR reporting is not required
for "global" capitation related to dental or vision health services.

Line 5 Emergency Room Services Enter all paid expenses incurred during an
encounter in an emergency room, i.e., the section of a healthcare facility
intended to provide rapid treatment for victims of sudden illness or trauma.
Includes the costs of the emergency room equipment, facility usage, staff, and
supplies.

The costs of emergency department ancillary services including laboratory
services, radiology services, respiratory therapy services, and diagnostic
studies, such as EKGs, CT scans, and supplies are also included on Line 5.
Excludes any non-staff, attending or consulting physician; billed separately as
PCP and/or specialist services. The total amount paid by the MCO or DN covering
all charges on a UB 92 claim that are incurred during an emergency room
encounter are classified as Emergency Room Services. Any amount(s) paid for any
charges on a UB 92 claim that include emergency room services that were incurred
on a different service date than the emergency room encounter are classified as
Outpatient Facility Services, unless they represent (an) additional emergency
room encounter(s).

Line 6 Outpatient Facility Services Enter all paid expenses for services
rendered to a member-patient that remains in a hospital based or freestanding
facility, such as an ambulatory surgical center, for less than 24 consecutive
hours and the member-patient is discharged from an outpatient status, except for

expenses of all delivery services and supplies provided by the facility where
the birth takes place, except for the Professional Component. Only those
amount(s) paid for charges on a UB-92 claim identified with Delivery ICD-9 Codes

charges on the same UB-92 inpatient claim that are not identified with Delivery
ICD-9 Codes are classified as Inpatient Facility Services - Medical/Surgical.

Line 9 Behavioral Health Services Enter all paid expenses incurred for inpatient
and outpatient mental health services and inpatient and outpatient chemical
dependency services including both treatment and detoxification of alcohol and
substance abuse. Only those amount(s) paid for charges on a CMS-1500 or UB-92

-    Any capitation payable to providers, and

-    Any reinsurance payable to reinsurers for ceded risk, net of any
     reinsurance receivable for assumed risk.

The IBNR medical expenses accrual is an estimate of the expected healthcare
expenses incurred but not paid based on claims lag schedules and completion
factors, as well as, any counts of services rendered but not billed, e.g.,
pre-authorized hospital days. Any major change in the claims processing function
that was not in effect during the period of time covered by the lag schedules
could materially impact the estimated IBNR accrual; hence, actuarial judgment
and adjustment may sometimes be needed.

expenses reported on Line 24 in a previously submitted FSR that have been paid
should be reported as zero (0) in the subsequent FSR.

Not Included in Total Administrative Above

Line 25 Allowable Pre-implementation Costs Enter the Pre-implementation Costs
that are allowable expenses to the initial contract period only, and are costs
incurred between signing the initial contract and the implementation date of the
contract.

These costs are excluded from Administrative Expenses, but are taken into
account in calculating the first contract period Experience Rebate. If the MCO
does not have a profit in the first contract period, these costs are a moot
point. If the MCO has a profit, the Pre-implementation Costs are subtracted from
the Net Income Before Taxes before applying the experience rebate calculations.
