<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Award</U>. The number of RSUs subject to this Award is set forth at the end of this
RSU Agreement. Each RSU constitutes an unfunded and unsecured promise of Allied World to deliver
(or cause to be delivered) to you, subject to the terms of this RSU Agreement, one Common Share
(the &#147;<U>Share</U>&#148; or the &#147;<U>Shares</U>&#148; as the context requires) (or cash equal to the Fair

five percent (25%) of the RSUs shall vest and become exercisable on each of the first, second,
third and fourth anniversaries of the Date of Grant specified at the end of this RSU Agreement

your name; or (ii)&nbsp;cause such Shares to be credited to your account at a third-party stock plan
administrator as may be arranged for by the Company or the Committee from time to time for purposes
of the administration of outstanding Awards under the Plan. You shall be deemed the beneficial
owner of the Shares at the close of business on a Delivery Date and shall be entitled to any
dividend or distribution that has not already been made with respect to such Shares if the record
date for such dividend or distribution is after the close of business on such Delivery Date. The
Company may, at its option, deliver, or cause to be delivered, cash in lieu of all or any portion
of the Shares otherwise deliverable on a Delivery Date specified at the end of this RSU
